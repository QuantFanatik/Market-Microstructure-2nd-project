NOTE 

Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group, a Nevada
corporation EUBG or the Company ), is not a Chinese operating company but a Nevada holding company. As a holding
company with no material operations of our own, EUBG conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries in Hong Kong and in the People s
Republic of China PRC or China ). Therefore our shareholders will not directly hold any equity interests in
our Chinese operating subsidiaries. Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, when used in this Annual Report,
the terms we, us, and our refer to EUBG and its consolidated subsidiaries, or any one or more
of them as the context may require, HK subsidiary refers to Entrepreneurship World Technology Holding Group Company Limited,
our wholly-owned subsidiary and a Hong Kong limited company, and PRC subsidiary refers to Xi an Yunchuang Space Information
Technology Co., Ltd., f/k/a Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited, a wholly-foreign owned Chinese subsidiary of HK subsidiary. EUBG
is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with different information. No dealer,
salesperson or other person is authorized to give any information or to represent anything not contained in this Annual Report. 

We currently do not, and we do not plan to use
variable interest entities VIE to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. We do not have any
contractual arrangements between the holding company, the HK subsidiary, and the PRC subsidiary. EUBG is a Nevada holding company and
does not have any substantive operations other than directly or indirectly holding the equity interest in our operating subsidiaries in
Hong Kong and China. Therefore our shareholders will not directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating subsidiaries. Our
holding company structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our corporate structure, which
would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock, including that it could
cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. See Risk Factors Risks associated
with doing business in China for detailed discussions. 

To the extent you make any investment in our Company,
it will be in EUBG, our holding company in Nevada, and not in our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong or in China. Because substantially
all of our operations are conducted in China through our PRC subsidiary, the Chinese government may exercise significant oversight and
discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our PRC operations at any time, which could result in a
material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock. The Chinese government could also significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to list and/or remain listed on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, and to offer future securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See Risk Factors Risks
associated with doing business in China - The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies
may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations
at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s
common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company s common stock to decline or be worthless. 

There are significant legal and operational risks
associated with being in and conducting a substantial portion of our operations in mainland China. PRC laws and regulations governing
our current business operations and corporate structure are sometimes vague and uncertain, and we face the risk that changes in the PRC
laws, regulations and policies, including how those laws, regulations and policies will be interpreted or implemented could have a significant
impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or
the value of the Company s common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or
become worthless. Furthermore, these risks may significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our
securities to investors in the future. See Risk Factors Risks associated with doing business in China 
for detailed discussions. 

ii 

Recent statements by the Chinese government have
indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China
based issuers. Any future action by the Chinese government expanding the categories of industries and companies whose foreign securities
offerings are subject to government review could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors and could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. In addition, recently, the PRC government
initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with
little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based
companies listed overseas using a VIE structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts
in anti-monopoly enforcement. We may be subject to regulations relating to overseas securities offering
and listing of China-based companies, including pursuant to the Opinions on Intensifying Crack Down on Illegal Securities Activities issued
by the PRC government authorities, which called for enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising
and listing by Chinese companies, and proposed measures such as the construction of regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents
faced by China-based overseas-listed companies; the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies and the supporting guidelines issued by the CSRC, which regulate overseas securities offering and listing activities by China-based
companies; the draft Regulations on Network Data Security Management issued by the CAC, which requires, among other things, that a prior
cybersecurity review be conducted by the Cybersecurity Review Office before listing overseas for data processors which process over one
million users personal information, and for the listing in Hong Kong of data processors which affect or may affect national security;
the Revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology of the PRC, and several other administrations, which require, among other things, that a network platform operator
holding over one million users personal information must apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review
before any public offering or listing outside of mainland PRC and Hong Kong. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks associated
with doing business in China The PRC government has the ability to exert substantial control over any offering or listing of securities
conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, and, as a result, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

As of the date of this Annual Report, our operating
subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC based on the Measures for Cybersecurity
Review (2021) and the Draft Regulation, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions in such respect or any regulatory
objections to this registration. Because these statements and regulatory actions are new, however, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative
or administrative regulation making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or regulations will be modified
or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations or
our ability to accept foreign investments and list on a U.S. exchange. If we are subject to such a probe or if we are required to comply
with stepped-up supervisory requirements, valuable time from our management and money may be expended in complying and/or responding to
the probe and requirements, thus diverting valuable resources and attention away from our operations. This may, in turn, negatively impact
our operations. 

According to our PRC legal counsel, King 
Wood Mallesons, except as disclosed in the Risk Factor section - Risks relating to PRC laws and regulations with respect
to foreign exchange , we and our subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission or approval from any of the PRC authorities
including CSRC or CAC to issue the Company s common stock to foreign investors, nor have we, or our subsidiaries, applied for or
received any denial for the Registration. However, recently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities
According to Law, or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to
strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by
Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the
risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar
matters. The Opinions and any related implementing rules to be enacted may subject us to compliance requirement in the future. Given the
current regulatory environment in the PRC, we are still subject to the uncertainty of interpretation and enforcement of the rules and
regulations in the PRC, which can change quickly with little advance notice, and any future actions of the PRC authorities. We cannot
assure you that relevant PRC government agencies would reach the same conclusion as we do or as advised by our PRC legal counsel. However,
(i) if we inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (ii) if the CSRC, the Cyberspace Administration
of China or other regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals to issue the Company s
common stock to foreign investors, and we are unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are established
to obtain such a waiver, then we may not be able to list on a U.S. exchange. In addition, any uncertainties and/or negative publicity
regarding such an approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. It is uncertain when
and whether we will be required to obtain permission from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to list on U.S. exchanges, and even
if such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded.

The PRC laws and regulations and government policy
changes rapidly on digital training. For our digital training related services, we worked with Beida Jade Bird Vocational Education Jade
Bird which was an authorized licensee of China National Personal Talent Training Network CNPTTN ), a PRC
regulatory agency for the talent training. Jade Bird was in charge of its training courses, and the Company was authorised by Jade Bird
as its sole training related administrator of the training courses, limited to coordinate the digital training related services to individual
clients who were interested in conducting live-broadcasting business through social medias. The Company provided training related services,
to these individual clients who subscribed courses, in arranging the examination, following up certificate issuance processes, addressing
clients concerns, etc. On March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that Jade Bird suspended its service after receiving a notice
from CNPTTN and that until further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services using its CNPTTN s name. As a result of
CNPTTN s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022
until further notice. In the future, laws and regulations and the CNPTTN may require our PRC Subsidiary to meet additional requirements
or obtain additional approvals, licenses or permits to conduct KOL training related business. If our PRC Subsidiary is unable to meet
the relevant requirements or obtain the relevant approvals, licenses or permits, our PRC Subsidiary may not be able to continue to conduct
the KOL training related business. As of the date of this Annual Report, there is no further notice from CNPTTN and the service is still
being suspended. As advised by our PRC legal counsel, other than the above, we and our subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain
permission from any of the PRC authorities to operate its principal business. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies
would reach the same conclusion as we do or as advised by our PRC legal counsel. If (i) we and our PRC legal counsel inadvertently concluded
that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (ii) the relevant regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring
that we obtain their approvals to operate our business, and we are unable to obtain approval or a waiver of such approval requirements,
any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business
operation and the trading price of our securities. 

Although we concluded that we and our subsidiaries
are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government and that we have not received any denial
to list on the U.S. exchange or to conduct our business operations, if (x) we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required
when they are, (y) we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals if and when required, or (z) changes in applicable laws,
regulations, or interpretations relating to our business or industry which would require us to obtain approvals in the future, our operations,
financial conditions, and results of operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, and the value of the Company s
common stock could significantly decline or become worthless. See Risk Factors Risks related to our business
and industry - Our PRC subsidiary may be required to obtain and maintain additional approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations and Risk Factors Risks
associated with doing business in China - The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies
may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations
at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s
common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company s common stock to decline or be worthless; - Uncertainties
exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations with respect to online platform
business operation; The PRC legal system is evolving, and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us; 
The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required in connection with this registration
under PRC law. 

On July 7, 2022, the CAC promulgated the Measures
for the Security Assessment for Cross-border Transfer of Data (the Security Assessment measures ), which will come
into effect on September 1, 2022. The Security Assessment measures stipulates that data processors which provide data cross-border and
have one of the following circumstances, should apply the security assessment to the national network information department through the
provincial branches of network information department: (A) data processors to provide important data cross-border; (B) operators of critical
information infrastructure and data processors handling personal information of more than 1 million people to provide personal information
cross-border;(C) data processors which provide cross-border a cumulative total of 100,000 people s personal information or 10,000
people s sensitive personal information since January 1 of the previous year; (D) other situations requiring application for the
security assessment regarding providing data cross-border as stipulated by the state Internet information department. As of the date of
this Annual Report, the PRC subsidiary has not provided any important data or personal data to any offshore institutions or individuals,
so the PRC subsidiary do not need to apply for a security assessment at this stage. However, if we need to provide data to offshore institutions
or individuals in the future and fall into the situations which should apply for the security assessment, we might not pass the security
assessment.

On December 16, 2021,
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region
of the People s Republic of China (PRC), because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these
determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA). The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered Public Accounting Firms
Subject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Hong Kong Determination, respectively.
 On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, taking the first step toward opening access for
the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. On
December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate audit firms in the
People s Republic of China (PRC) for the first time in history, in 2022. Therefore, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board voted
to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, uncertainties exist with respect to the implementation of these provisions and there is no assurance that the PCAOB will be
able to execute, in a timely manner, its future inspections and investigations in a manner that satisfies the Statement of Protocol. The
audit report included in this registration statement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was issued by Centurion ZD CPA Co. CZD
CPA ), an audit firm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct
inspections or investigate auditors. CZD CPA is among those listed by the PCAOB Hong Kong Determination, a determination announced by
the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered
in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong
Kong. The lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures
of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of
the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms 
audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. In
addition, under the HFCAA (as amended by the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2023), our securities may be prohibited from trading on the
U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for two consecutive
years, and this ultimately could result in the Company s common stock being delisted. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the
Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act AHFCAA ), which was enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023, as further described below. 

On April 22, 2022, the
SEC provisionally identified EUBG as a company that has retained a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where
that registered public accounting firm has a branch or office that (i) is located in a foreign jurisdiction and (ii) the PCAOB
is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction under the HFCAA (a Commission-Identified
Issuer ). On May 12, 2022, that provisional identification became conclusive and we are now subject to the requirements under the
HFCAA, including the prohibition on the trading of such issuer s securities on a national securities exchange or through any other
method is within the SEC s jurisdiction to regulate, including over-the-counter trading. This identification of EUBG
as a Commission-Identified Issuer does not mean that we will be immediately prohibited from trading our securities on the OTC Pink Sheets.
However, we may be prohibited from trading our securities, including trading in the over-the-counter market, if we continue
to be unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for two consecutive years under the HFCAA as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023. In addition, after the first year of identification, we will be subject to new submission and disclosure requirements in our
subsequent annual reports. 

On December 29, 2022,
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA (i) to reduce the number of consecutive years
that would trigger delisting from three years to two years, and (ii) so that any foreign jurisdiction could be the reason why the PCAOB
does not to have complete access to inspect or investigate a company s auditors. As it was originally enacted, the HFCAA applied
only if the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction
where the relevant public accounting firm is located. As a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the HFCAA now also applies
if the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate the relevant accounting firm is due to a position taken by an authority in any
foreign jurisdiction. The denying jurisdiction does not need to be where the accounting firm is located. 

v 

On September 7, 2022,
the Company dismissed CZD CPA and appointed Prager Metis CPAs, LLC PragerMetis as the Company s independent auditor
for the fiscal year end December 31, 2022. Our current auditors, PragerMetis, is located at Hackensack, New Jersey, and has been inspected
by the PCAOB. 

EUBG is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or
capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital
contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC subsidiary will use the cash for
their daily business operations. However, under existing PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries shall not exceed a statutory
limit, and shall be filed with SAFE or its local bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary
shall be filed with the local commerce department. The PRC subsidiary is the main operating company to earn revenue. The HK subsidiary
is also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong SAR to provide funding to EUBG through dividend distribution without restrictions on the
amount of the funds. Current PRC laws require that dividends be paid only out of the profit for the year calculated according to PRC accounting
principles, which differ from the generally accepted accounting principles in other jurisdictions. In addition, PRC laws also require
a foreign-invested enterprise to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits, if any, to fund its statutory reserves, until the aggregate
amount reaches 50 of its registered capital. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may, at its discretion, allocate a portion
of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting principles to enterprise expansion funds, staff welfare, and bonus funds. Those reserve
funds are not available for distribution as cash dividends. The PRC government s control of foreign currency conversion may limit
our foreign exchange transactions. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items can be made in foreign
currencies without prior approval from SAFE. However, approval from SAFE, or registration with SAFE or other appropriate departments is
required where RMB shall be converted into foreign currency and be remitted out of the PRC. Failure to comply with the above regulations
may result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of foreign exchange controls. 

As of the date of this
Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary has distributed 7.1 million (net of withholding tax at 789,608 charged at a rate of 10 of the declared
dividend) to its holding parent, which is our HK subsidiary. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the above regulations
in all respects in the future. If we fail to comply with the above regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may
be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Since
EUBG, the Nevada holding company, is not the direct parent company of the PRC subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfers
to the other. We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business conducted by our subsidiaries, and we do
not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future from the HK subsidiary to EUBG, the Nevada holding company,
and/or from EUBG to its shareholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, other than the above stated 7.1 million cash dividends transferred
from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary for operational costs, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets (including dividends
and distribution) have occurred among EUBG, our Nevada holding company, and either of its subsidiaries, our HK subsidiary or our PRC subsidiary.
See Risk Factors Risks associated with doing business in China for a detailed discussion of the Chinese
legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to transfer cash within the Company and the potential for holders of the Company s
common stock to be subject to Chinese taxes on dividends paid by us in the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese
tax purposes. 

The PRC government has significant oversight and
discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further
regulatory, political and societal goals. To the extent that the cash and assets of our business are in our PRC subsidiary and/or Hong
Kong subsidiary, such cash or assets may not be available to fund our operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong
due to the potential intervention by the PRC government to impose restrictions and limitations over our ability or our subsidiaries 
ability to transfer cash or assets. Any such intervention in or influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight
and control over the cash or assets of our subsidiaries, once taken by the PRC government, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock, or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become
worthless. See Risk Factors Risks associated with doing business in China - The recent state government
interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China.
The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations
and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company s
common stock to decline or be worthless. 

On September 1, 2021,
our PRC subsidiary adopted a written Monetary and Cash Fund Management System Cash Management Policy for its operations
in China and Hong Kong. The Cash Management Policy covers cash, bank deposits and other monetary funds owned by the PRC subsidiary and
Hong Kong subsidiary and includes procedures on receiving funds, depositing funds, transferring funds and proper documentation and recording
of cash. We adopted the Cash Management Policy in order to provide a process and guidance on collecting, accounting for, and safeguarding
all cash and cash equivalents of our PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary, including 1) checking the latest regulation requirements
between China and Hong Kong; and 2) seeking approval from EUBG s chief executive officer in order to transfer funds from our PRC
subsidiary to our HK subsidiary. EUBG does not have a cash management policy.

PART I 

Item 1. Business 

History of Our Company 

EUBG was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
April 21, 1999 under the name LE GOURMET CO, INC. Since EUBG s inception, the Company had the following name changes: On March 17,
2003, to Estelle Reyna, Inc.; on September 11, 2003 to Karma Media, Inc.; on July 8, 2005 to Pitboss Entertainment, Inc.; on March 3,
2006 to US Energy Holdings, Inc.; on December 20, 2006 to Lonestar Group Holdings Company; on November 9, 2007 to Guardian Angel Group,
Inc.; and on May 18, 2011 to REE International, Inc.; and on March 23, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Nevada
Secretary of State amending Article I of its Articles of Incorporation changing the Company s name to Entrepreneur Universe Bright
Group, with an effective date of April 3, 2020. 

Lonestar Group Holdings Company was a voluntary
filer and filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on August 20, 2007. 

In July 2018, XTC Inc. XTC ), one
of EUBG s shareholders, petitioned the Eight Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada (the Court ), for appointment
as custodian of the Company. On September 4, 2018, the Court granted XTC custodianship of the Company with the right to appoint officers
and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock and authorize new classes of stock (the Custodianship ). 

Since the Form 15 filing
on August 20, 2007 and prior to the Custodianship, the Company s management believes that it was inactive with no business operations.
In December 2018, XTC filed a Certificate of Revival for a revival of its charter, effective December 13, 2018, with the Nevada Secretary
of State. XTC acted together with MXD Inc. MXD to revive the Company and to get current. MXD is a private company incorporated
in the State of Colorado. As the president of XTC is also the president of MXD, the Company considered that the XTC and MXD are under
common control. 

XTC and MXD performed
the following actions in its capacity as custodian: 

Funded all expenses of the Company including paying off all outstanding liabilities discovered; 

Brought the Company back in compliance with the Nevada Secretary of State, resident agent, transfer agent, OTC Markets Group; 

Brought in and paid for accounting professionals as well as securities counsel. 

On December 18, 2018,
the Company formed REE International, Inc. Colorado REE-CO ). On December 21, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement
for Divestiture of Assets to Subsidiary with REE-CO, where all of the Company s assets, liabilities, and business were transferred
to REE-CO. in exchange for 1,000 shares of REE-CO, and the Company became the parent company of REE-CO. Since then, the Company has no
assets, liabilities and business. 

On December 28, 2018,
the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the SPA with XTC to transfer 1,000 common shares of REE-CO to XTC
at nil cash consideration (with XTC assuming all of the obligations and liabilities of REE-CO). Pursuant to the SPA, all the assets and
liabilities previously reported in the Company s financial statements were acquired by XTC and all the continuing obligations assumed
were taken up by XTC. Since the closing of the SPA, REE-CO ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company on the same date., and the Company
no longer had any assets, liabilities and business. 

In consideration of the payments made to revive
the Company and get current by the XTC and MXD, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to MXD on December 11,
2018 and issued 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to XTC on February 27, 2019, respectively. 

On March 5, 2019, the total authorized common
stock of the Company was increased to 1,800,000,000. 

On April 24, 2019, XTC was discharged as custodian
of the Company. Prior to the Custodianship and immediately before May 15, 2019, the Company has abandoned all of its business operations. 

1 

On May 15, 2019, 1,590,605,141
shares of the common stock was issued to MXD as consideration for its services to revive the Company and get current. On the same date,
MXD and XTC agreed to voluntarily retire 1,000,000 Series A Preferred Stock and 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, respectively
(the Issuance ). 

Immediately after the
Issuance, MXD entered into certain Sale and Purchase Agreements, dated May 15, 2019 (the Stock Purchase Agreements ), with
Tethys Fountain Limited, New Finance Consultants Limited, Jia Wang, Jianyong Li, Haijun Jiang, Xuebin Wu and Fanfan Chen (collectively,
the Purchasers ), to transfer all its 1,590,605,141 shares of common stock of the Company to the Purchasers in exchange for
an aggregate purchase price of 135,000. Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements, the Purchasers collectively owned 93.5 of
the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and Tethys Fountain Limited became the controlling shareholder
of the Company. 

On May 20, 2019, and as authorized by the Company s
board of directors, the Company began its current business as a marketing consulting company, as further described in the section entitled
 Item 1. Business Business Overview below. 

Corporate Structure 

EUBG is a holding
company for its operating subsidiaries. The operations of the Company s PRC subsidiary, Xi an Yunchuang Space Information
Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited) in Xi an, China are the primary operations of EUBG. Our
PRC subsidiary is wholly-owned by the Company s HK subsidiary, Entrepreneurship World Technology Holding Group Company Limited,
a Hong Kong limited company. The HK Subsidiary was incorporated by the Company on May 15, 2019 with HK 10,000 as its registered capital
as a holding company. The PRC subsidiary was incorporated on October 18, 2019 with HK 1,000,000 as its registered capital. On May 7, 2020,
we incorporated Xian Yunchuang Space Information Technology Co., Ltd, BaiYin Branch (formerly Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited,
BaiYin Branch), with RMB900,000 as its registered capital, as a branch office of the PRC subsidiary in Baiyin City, Gansu Province, China. 

While the Company s major shareholders,
headquarters, and operations are located in China, EUBG currently does not, and EUBG does not plan to use variable interest entities to
execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. EUBG is a Nevada holding company and does not have any substantive
operations other than indirectly holding the equity interest in our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong and China. Therefore, our shareholders
will not directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating subsidiaries. Our holding company structure involves unique risks
to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our corporate structure, which would likely result in a material change in
our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or become worthless. 

We face various legal and operational risks and
uncertainties related to being based in and having substantially all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority
to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on
an U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly
regulatory actions, oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could
result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock or could significantly limit or completely
hinder the Company s ability to offer or continue to offer Stocks and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such
securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See Risk Factors Risks Associated with doing business
in China The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively
impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which
could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s common stock,
including potentially causing the value of the Company s common stock to decline or be worthless; Uncertainties with respect
to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations
in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us; The PRC legal system is evolving,
and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us; The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes.
Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential
value. Therefore, the Company s susceptibility to such laws is unknown; The approval of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required in connection with this registration under PRC law.

The PRC government has significant oversight and
discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to
further regulatory, political and societal goals. See Risk Factors Risks associated with doing business in
China Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden
or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and
us. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education
and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our
industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has
recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities
and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit
or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. See Risk Factors Risks Associated with doing business

PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations
in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us. 

The PRC laws and regulations and government policy
changes rapidly on digital training. For our digital training related services, we worked with Beida Jade Bird Vocational Education Jade
Bird which was an authorized licensee of China National Personal Talent Training Network CNPTTN ), a PRC regulatory
agency for the talent training. Jade Bird was in charge of its training courses, and the Company was authorised by Jade Bird as its sole
training related administrator of the training courses, limited to coordinate the digital training related services to individual clients
who were interested in conducting live-broadcasting business through social medias. The Company provided training related services, to
these individual clients who subscribed courses, in arranging the examination, following up certificate issuance processes, addressing
clients concerns, etc. On March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that Jade Bird suspended its service after receiving a notice
from CNPTTN and that until further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services using its CNPTTN s name. As a result of
CNPTTN s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022
until further notice. In the future, laws and regulations and the CNPTTN may require our PRC Subsidiary to meet additional requirements
or obtain additional approvals, licenses or permits to conduct KOL training related business. If our PRC Subsidiary is unable to meet
the relevant requirements or obtain the relevant approvals, licenses or permits, our PRC Subsidiary may not be able to continue to conduct
the KOL training related business. As of the date of this Annual Report, there is no further notice from CNPTTN and the service is still
being suspended. Other than the above, we and our subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC authorities
to operate its principal business. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies would reach the same conclusion as we do.
If (i) we inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (ii) the relevant regulatory PRC agencies later
promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals to operate our business, and we are unable to obtain approval or a waiver
of such approval requirements, any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement could have a material
adverse effect on our business operation and the trading price of our securities. 

Although we concluded we and our subsidiaries
are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government and has not received any denial to list
on the U.S. exchange or to conduct our business operation, if (x) we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required when
they are, (y) we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals if and when required, or (z) changes in applicable laws, regulations,
or interpretations relating to our business or industry which would require us to obtain approvals in the future, our operations, financial
conditions, and results of operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, and the value of the Company s common
stock could significantly decline or become worthless. See Risk Factors Risks related to our business and industry

EUBG is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or
capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital
contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC subsidiary will use the cash for
their daily business operations. However, under existing PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries shall not exceed a statutory
limit, and shall be filed with SAFE or its local bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary
shall be filed with the local commerce department. The PRC subsidiary is the main operating company to earn revenue. The HK subsidiary
is also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong SAR to provide funding to EUBG through dividend distribution without restrictions on the
amount of the funds. Current PRC laws require that dividends be paid only out of the profit for the year calculated according to PRC accounting
principles, which differ from the generally accepted accounting principles in other jurisdictions. In addition, PRC laws also require
a foreign-invested enterprise to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits, if any, to fund its statutory reserves, until the aggregate
amount reaches 50 of its registered capital. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may, at its discretion, allocate a portion
of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting principles to enterprise expansion funds, staff welfare, and bonus funds. Those reserve
funds are not available for distribution as cash dividends. The PRC government s control of foreign currency conversion may limit
our foreign exchange transactions. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items can be made in foreign
currencies without prior approval from SAFE. However, approval from SAFE, or registration with SAFE or other appropriate departments is
required where RMB shall be converted into foreign currency and be remitted out of the PRC. Failure to comply with the above regulations
may result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of foreign exchange controls. 

As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC
subsidiary has distributed 7.1 million (net of withholding tax at 789,608 charged at a rate of 10 of the declared dividend) to its
holding parent, which is our HK subsidiary. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the above regulations in all
respects in the future. If we fail to comply with the above regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may be negatively
affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Since EUBG, the Nevada
holding company, is not the direct parent company of the PRC subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfers to the other.
We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business conducted by our subsidiaries, and we do not anticipate
that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future from the HK subsidiary to EUBG, the Nevada holding company, and/or from
EUBG to its shareholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, other than the above stated 7.1 million cash dividends transferred from
our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary for operational costs, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets (including dividends and distribution)
have occurred among EUBG, our Nevada holding company, and either of its subsidiaries, our HK subsidiary or our PRC subsidiary. See
 Summary of Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in the PRC and Risk Factors Risks
associated with doing business in China for a detailed discussion of the Chinese legal restrictions on the payment of dividends,
our ability to transfer cash within the Company and the potential for holders of the Company s common stock to be subject to Chinese
taxes on dividends paid by us in the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, total undistributed profits of the Company s PRC subsidiary were 1,882,886 and 3,579,288, respectively.
We have recognized deferred tax liabilities of 188,289 and 357,929, respectively, in respect of the undistributed profits. For more
details, please refer to consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

The PRC government has significant oversight and
discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further
regulatory, political and societal goals. To the extent that the cash and assets of our business are in our PRC subsidiary and/or Hong
Kong subsidiary, such cash or assets may not be available to fund our operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong
due to the potential intervention by the PRC government to impose restrictions and limitations over our ability or our subsidiaries 
ability to transfer cash or assets. Any such intervention in or influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight
and control over the cash or assets of our subsidiaries, once taken by the PRC government, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock, or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become
worthless. See Risk Factors Risks associated with doing business in China - The recent state government
interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China.
The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations
and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company s
common stock to decline or be worthless.

On September 1, 2021, our PRC subsidiary and Hong
Kong subsidiary adopted a written Monetary and Cash Fund Management System Cash Management Policy for its operations in
China and Hong Kong. The Cash Management Policy covers cash, bank deposits and other monetary funds owned by the PRC subsidiary and Hong
Kong subsidiary and includes procedures on receiving funds, depositing funds, transferring funds and proper documentation and recording
of cash. We adopted the Cash Management Policy in order to provide a process and guidance on collecting,
accounting for, and safeguarding all cash and cash equivalents of our PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary, including 1) checking the
latest regulation requirements between China and Hong Kong; and 2) seeking approval from EUBG s chief executive officer in order
to transfer funds from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary. EUBG does not have a cash management policy. 

On December 16, 2021,
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region
of the People s Republic of China (PRC), because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these
determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCAA.
The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Mainland China Determination
and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Hong Kong Determination, respectively. On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the Ministry
of Finance of the PRC, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to
secure complete access to inspect and investigate audit firms in the People s Republic of China (PRC) for the first time in history,
in 2022. Therefore, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, uncertainties exist with respect to the implementation of these provisions and there is no assurance that the PCAOB will
be able to execute, in a timely manner, its future inspections and investigations in a manner that satisfies the Statement of Protocol. 
The audit report included in this registration statement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was issued by Centurion ZD CPA Co. CZD CPA ), an audit firm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined that the PCAOB is unable
to conduct inspections or investigate auditors. CZD CPA is among those listed by the PCAOB Hong Kong Determination, a determination announced
by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered
in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong
Kong. The lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures
of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of
the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms 
audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. In
addition, under the HFCAA (as amended by the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2023), our securities may be prohibited from trading on the
U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for two consecutive
years, and this ultimately could result in the Company s common stock being delisted. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the
Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act AHFCAA ), which was enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023, as further described below. 

On April 22, 2022, the
SEC provisionally identified EUBG as a company that has retained a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where
that registered public accounting firm has a branch or office that (i) is located in a foreign jurisdiction and (ii) the PCAOB
is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction under the HFCAA (a Commission-Identified
Issuer ). On May 12, 2022, that provisional identification became conclusive and we are now subject to the requirements under the
HFCAA, including the prohibition on the trading of such issuer s securities on a national securities exchange or through any other
method is within the SEC s jurisdiction to regulate, including over-the-counter trading. This identification of EUBG
as a Commission-Identified Issuer does not mean that we will be immediately prohibited from trading our securities on the OTC Pink Sheets.
However, we may be prohibited from trading our securities, including trading in the over-the-counter market, if we continue
to be unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for two consecutive years under the HFCAA as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2023. In addition, after the first year of identification, we will be subject to new submission and disclosure requirements in our
subsequent annual reports.

On December 29, 2022,
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA (i) to reduce the number of consecutive years
that would trigger delisting from three years to two years, and (ii) so that any foreign jurisdiction could be the reason why the PCAOB
does not to have complete access to inspect or investigate a company s auditors. As it was originally enacted, the HFCAA applied
only if the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction
where the relevant public accounting firm is located. As a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the HFCAA now also applies
if the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate the relevant accounting firm is due to a position taken by an authority in any
foreign jurisdiction. The denying jurisdiction does not need to be where the accounting firm is located.

Cash Transfer within
our Organization 

EUBG is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or
capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital
contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC subsidiary will use the cash to
pay for their daily business operations. The PRC subsidiary in China is the main operating company to earn revenue. However, under existing
PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries shall not exceed a statutory limit, and shall be filed with SAFE or its local
bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary shall be filed with the local commerce department. 

Current investments in Chinese companies, which
are governed by the Foreign Investment Law, and the dividends and distributions from our PRC subsidiary are subject to regulations and
restrictions on dividends and payment to parties outside of China are subject to restrictions. The principal regulations governing the
distribution of dividends paid by WFOEs include the Company Law of PRC, and the Foreign Investment Law. According to the Foreign Investment
Law of the People s Republic of China and its implementing rules, which jointly established the legal framework for the administration
of foreign-invested companies, a foreign investor may, in accordance with other applicable laws, freely transfer into or out of China
its contributions, profits, capital earnings, income from asset disposal, intellectual property rights, royalties acquired, compensation
or indemnity legally obtained, and income from liquidation, made or derived within the territory of China in RMB or any foreign currency,
and any entity or individual shall not illegally restrict such transfer in terms of the currency, amount and frequency. Under these regulations,
our PRC subsidiary in China may pay dividends only out of its accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting
standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary in China is required to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits based
on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reach 50 of its registered capital.
These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until
any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable
profits from the current fiscal year. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal
in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary. In contrast, there is presently no foreign exchange control
or restrictions on capital flows into and out of Hong Kong. Hence, our Hong Kong subsidiary is able to transfer cash without any limitation
to the United States under normal circumstances. 

Renminbi, or RMB, is not freely convertible into
other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use their potential
future RMB revenues to pay dividends to us. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies
and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability
of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to our offshore entities for those offshore entities to pay dividends or make
other payments or otherwise to satisfy our foreign-currency-denominated obligations. RMB is currently convertible under the current
account, which includes dividends and trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital
account, which includes foreign direct investment and foreign debt (which may be denominated in foreign currency or RMB), including
loans we may secure for our PRC subsidiary. Currently, our PRC subsidiary may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account
transactions, including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (SAFE)
by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability
to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. The Chinese government may continue to strengthen its capital
controls, and additional restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be instituted by SAFE for cross-border transactions falling
under both the current account and the capital account. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability
to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside of China or pay dividends in foreign currencies to holders
of our securities. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or
registration with, SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency
through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. See the risk factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of this
Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the Chinese legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to transfer cash within
the Company and the potential for holders of the Company s common stock to be subject to Chinese taxes on dividends paid by us in
the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes. 

12 

To address persistent capital outflows and the
RMB s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People s Bank of China and the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting
procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments.
The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiary s dividends and other distributions may
be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies
and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures
necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if the PRC subsidiary
incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. 

In addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and
its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10 will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies
to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of
other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to
a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5 from a standard rate of 10 . However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions
or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable
withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5 withholding rate will apply to dividends received
by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our
PRC subsidiary. 

Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary
to pay dividends to HK subsidiary only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards
and regulations. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the PRC regulations in all respects in the future. If we
fail to comply with the PRC regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may be negatively affected, which could
materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC
subsidiary distributed 7.1 million (net of withholding tax at 789,608 charged at a rate of 10 of the declared dividend) to its holding
parent, the HK subsidiary. As long as meeting the above-mentioned requirements, there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends
from our PRC subsidiary to its Hong Kong parent company, and there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends from our Hong
Kong subsidiary to its US parent holding company. Since EUBG, the Nevada holding company, is not the direct parent company of the PRC
subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfer to the other. We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion
of our business to our subsidiaries, and we do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future from the
HK subsidiary to EUBG, and/or from EUBG to its shareholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, other than the above stated 7.1 million
cash dividends transferred from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary for operation costs, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets
(including dividends and distribution) have occurred among our EUBG, our Nevada holding company and its subsidiaries, either the HK subsidiary
or the PRC subsidiary. For more details for the withholding tax paid, see our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

B. KOL (Key Opinion
Leaders) Training Related Services 

The core advantage of Influencer Marketing (Influencer
Marketing) is the precise market positioning and exposure to tens of thousands of target audiences in a short period of time. According
to recent survey data conducted by ChiefMarketer, 75 of marketers adopt the strategy of online influencer marketing, and 43 of them
plan to increase their investment in this area in 2019 (Source: ChiefMarketer, https://www.chiefmarketer.com/majority-marketers-use-influencers-survey/).
Enterprises choose to cooperate with the brand and have a level of follower influence. The influencer then introduces and recommends those
companies products to their followers through creative video content on a social media platform on a professional platform. 

An influencer has an excellent ability to generate
content, and enjoys creativity, content creation, and sharing audience. If influencers know their followers well, care about their feelings,
and know what content to post, it is more effective for the followers. If the influencers and the client s branding match accurately,
the communication and cooperation between the two parties would work smoothly. 

The word influencer as it is used
in China is broad and applies to people who are bloggers, online content creators, vloggers and live streamers, as well as traditional
celebrities. China has its own terminology to refer to an influencer marketing practitioner: key opinion leader (KOL) or wang-hong, 
which is the romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation for online celebrity. 

Chinese users behave differently when it comes
to taking advice. Instead of depending on search engines, Chinese users value advice from sources such as their peers, friends, bloggers
and celebrities also known as KOL (Key Opinion Leaders). Much like influencers in the Western world, KOLs are very crucial in the overall
digital marketing approach in China. An industry of wang-hong incubators or KOL academies is thriving to meet
the flood of KOL aspirants. Currently, our PRC subsidiary cooperates with third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate,
recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional anchor quality. Such programs are able to qualify the trainees
to obtain anchor licenses/permits before they broadcast on the internet. 

In August 2020, our PRC subsidiary starts to cooperates
with third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate, recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional
anchor quality. Such programs are able to qualify the trainees to obtain anchor licenses/permits before they broadcast on the internet.
In this business, the third party live-broadcasting training agencies take the primarily responsibilities for providing the training programs
to the KOL students. Our services are to these live-broadcasting training agencies, which include but not limit to, recruiting and enrolling
KOL students and coordinating the schedule of training course teachers on behalf of the live-broadcasting training agencies. Our PRC subsidiary
generated consultancy services income directly from the live-broadcasting agencies based on the number of successful enrolled KOL students
recruited by us. 

In September 2021, our PRC subsidiary starts to
provide digital training related services to clients who are interested to conduct live-broadcasting business through social medias. We
require the clients to pay a pre-established fee in exchange for the services. Revenues are recognized when promised services (e.g. preliminary
consulting work, setting up of an e-learning account and delivery of learning materials) are delivered to the clients. 

However, on March 22, 2022, our PRC subsidiary
learned that Beijing Jade Bird Culture and Art Research Institute Jade Bird ), the KOL agency that the PRC subsidiary works
with to coordinate digital training related service, suspended its service after receiving a notice from China National Personal Talent
Training Network CNPTTN ), a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training, that until further notice. CNPTTN has suspended
all recruitment services using its CNPTTN s name. As a result of CNPTTN s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended
its digital training related services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022 until further notice. Jade Bird is an authorized licensee of
CNPTTN. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the digital training related services with Jade Bird represented 7.5 and 20.9 
of our total revenue, or 262,799 and 1,176,515, respectively. 

The future plan of our KOL Training Related Services
will include: Individual KOL training providing training sites, positioning KOLs individually according to their personality and
appearance, languages and body languages training, one-on-one contents operation training, IP packaging, and their channel operation supporting.
We also work with our clients to provide the training classes in training their own potential KOL candidates. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we generated 264,026 and 1,261,159, respectively, from the KOL Training Related Services, represented 7.5 and 22.4 of our total revenue.

Our Strategy 

We, through our PRC subsidiary,
has extensive experience with the Chuangyetianxia Platform that allow us to provide marketing consulting services to our
customers leveraging the Platform to quickly increase customer traffic to our client s products and services. We consider Xi an
CNT a related party as it is substantially owned and controlled by the wife and relatives of Mr. Tao Guolin, our chairman, executive officer
and majority shareholder. 

We also cooperate with
third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate, recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional
anchor quality. 

Our business objective
is to generate revenues based on providing our digital marketing consultation and to maintain and grow ultimate user group for our clients. 

Our target market is
the start-up and small-size companies mainly situation in China which needs to upgrade their traditional marketing plan to digital marketing
and establishing their brand names and exploit products market in the digital world and specified target audiences. 

We seek to leverage our
marketing management s experience to expand our consumer base, starting with start-ups and small-size corporate clients. Our customers
are from different market sectors including but not limited to online education, biotechnology, health care products, and agriculture
technology products. 

Potential competitors 

Our China subsidiary is operating in a highly
competitive consulting market, from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our main competitors include: Soplan ),
Han-Consulting ), Osens Bayii ), Huayuhua SEMTIME,
and Caina ). 

However, to our knowledge, none of these consulting
companies are providing the services that integrates customers APPS to other APP platform likes we do. We provide our marketing
consultation services to our customers by introducing and assisting them with integrating their APPs with and into the Chuangyetianxia.
We leverage Chuangyetianxia Platform and active users to save the time and efforts of our customers to build up their own users base.
Our customers are able to attract traffic to their APPs by simply applying and adapting to Chuangyetianxia Platform. In addition, Xi an
CNT is able to generate more traffic from the existing users of our customers. This model that we created is a win-win solution for our
customers and to Xi an CNT. 

Those competitors are not using the methods to
connect different APPs together to bring cross-traffics to each other s platforms. Though we believe that we are the pioneer in
using this strategy, these competitors may adopt the same method for their clients. 

Our Challenges with Having Operations in China 

Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group is a Nevada
holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations and business in China through its PRC subsidiary. Such structure involves
unique risks to investors in the Company s common stock. For a detailed description of the risk, see Risk Factors ,
including the risks described under the subsections headed Risks Related to Our Business and Industry , Risks associated
with doing business in China and Risks Related to the Market for the Company s Common Stock . In particular,
as we are a China-based company incorporated in Nevada, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being
based in and having substantially all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the
ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on an U.S. or other foreign
exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, oversight
on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could result in a material change
in our operations and/or the value of the Company s common stock or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to
offer or continue to offer the Company s common stock and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities
to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business
and our operations may be affected by evolving regulatory policies as a result. The PRC government has recently published new policies
that significantly affected certain industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations
or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,
the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital
markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. These risks could result in a material change in our operations
and the value of the Company s common stock, or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. You should pay special
attention to the subsection headed Risks associated with doing business in China below. 

16 

Key Factors that Affect Operating Results 

We believe the following key factors may affect
our financial condition and results of operations: 

Our success depends on our ability to acquire
clients effectively 

Our ability to increase our revenue largely depends
on our ability to attract and engage potential clients. Our sales and marketing efforts include those related to client acquisition and
retention, and general marketing. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts and constantly
seek to improve the effectiveness of these efforts to grow our revenues. 

Our client acquisition channels primarily include
our sales and marketing campaigns and existing client referrals. In order to acquire clients, we have made significant efforts in building
mutually beneficial long-term relationships with local government and local business associations. In addition, we also market our services
through the influence of our founder and CEO, Mr. Guolin Tao, who is a well-known entrepreneur in China. If any of our current client
acquisition channels becomes less effective, or if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, we may not be able to attract
new clients in a cost-effective manner or convert potential clients into active clients and may even lose our existing clients to our
competitors. To the extent that our current client acquisition and retention efforts becomes less effective, our service revenue may be
significantly impacted, which would have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our operations for the year ended December
31, 2022 depends on one major customer 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the customer
for our PRC subsidiary that constitutes a greater-than ten percent (10 contribution to net revenues is Zhongchuang Boli Technology Holdings
Co., Ltd (47 who is a marketplace operator conducting both agency-based sourcing services and digital marketing services with our PRC
subsidiary. 

For agency-based sourcing services, it represents
product procurement on behalf of the customer. We recognized revenues from agency-based sourcing at a fixed rate on the value of goods
that are sourced and delivered to the ultimate customers by the customer. The service agreements is renewed every year. 

For Digital marketing services, we help
the customer to promote designated products or services through social medial influencers engaged by the customer. We are entitled to
a fixed rate on the revenue generated by the customer that are related to the designated products or services. The duration of this service
agreement is 3 years. No renewal term is included in the agreement as this will be determined by our management on a case-by-case basis. 

The customer is required to settle the service
fees in accordance with the predetermined settlement period (e.g. weekly) in accordance with the service agreements. 

There is a risk to our revenue in case the major
customer decided to terminate the services with us which will significantly harm our business. 

A severe or prolonged slowdown in the global
or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 

The rapid growth of the Chinese economy has slowed
down since 2012 and such slowdown may continue in the future. There is considerable uncertainty over the trade conflicts between the United
States and China and the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial
authorities of some of the world s leading economies, including the United States and China; the withdrawal of these expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies could lead to a contraction. There continue to be concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle
East, Europe, and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets. There are also concerns about the relationship among
China and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. The eruption
of armed conflict could adversely affect global or Chinese discretionary spending, either of which could have a material and adverse effect
on our business, results of operation in financial condition. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions,
as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any
severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy would likely materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. In addition, continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital
markets to meet liquidity needs.

Our services depend on our ability to retain
our cooperation with Xi an CNT 

A significant portion of our PRC subsidiary s
revenues are generated from our PRC subsidiary s marketing consulting services that relies on an e-commerce APP known as Chuangyetianxia .
The APP is developed by our related company, Xi an CNT, which offers a range of capabilities that connects sellers with buyers,
for example wholesale companies and the end customers. It offers users an interface to the supplier s services/product catalogues. 

Through our PRC subsidiary s prior working
relationship with Xi an CNT and our extensive experience with the Platform, we are able to provide our customers with customized
service and seamless integration of our customers APP to the Platform and assisting them in connecting with the Platform and assisting
them in achieving a specific business objective (e.g. end customer placed an order to buy a product or enroll a course). We are entitled
to a fixed rate on revenue generated by our client that are related to the scope of respective consultancy services upon client acceptance
on the services provided. 

In addition, we, through our PRC subsidiary, also
provide agency-based sourcing and digital marketing services to connect marketplace operators and merchants. Agency-based sourcing services
represents product procurement on behalf of the Platform. We recognize revenues from agency-based sourcing at a fixed rate on the value
of goods that are sourced and delivered to the ultimate customers by the merchants. Digital marketing services are provided to the Platform
to promote designated products or services through social medial influencers engaged by us. We are entitled to a fixed rate on the revenue
generated by the Platform that are related to the designated products or services. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we derived services revenues of 1,981,096 and 4,152,617, respectively, through the APP platform, represented 56.5 and 73.7 of our
total revenue. In case Xi an CNT suspends the Platform, or the normal operation of the Platform is disrupted, or our customers are
denied access to the Platform, our revenue will be significantly affected. 

The impact from COVID-19 could materially
and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 

In early January of 2020, a novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak took place in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, it has spread rapidly to Asia and other parts of the world.
The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread economic disruptions in China, as well as stringent government measures by the Chinese
government to contain its transmissions including quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closures of non-essential businesses
in China and elsewhere. 

At the end of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China
appears to be generally under control and business activities have recovered on the whole. The outbreak became more stabilized in China
and other regions in the world. However, sporadic cases continue to be found during the first half year of 2021 in China. In the second
quarter of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 had been found in certain cities in China, which cause another outbreak, thus increasing
risks and possible further disruption to businesses. Therefore, certain of our consulting services were suspended from April 2021 to August
2021. We have resumed these consulting businesses from August 2021 in order to maintain diversified services for our customers. 

As of December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic
continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although vaccines are now being distributed and administered
across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue to emerge that have shown to be more contagious.
We continue to adhere to applicable governmental and commercial restrictions and to work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our employees,
customers, communities, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the company s business,
operations and financial results from this point forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict.
Those factors include the following: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals actions in
response to the pandemic in the future; and any other further development of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Substantially all of the Company s revenues
and operations are concentrated in China. Consequently, our results of operations and financial performances have been affected since
2020 and into 2022. Due to widespread economic disruptions during the outbreak, demand for the Company s consulting services by
small and medium-sized enterprises were also adversely affected. Specifically, as a result of government mandated closures of non-essential
business in China, many of the Company s customers business were suspended while others permanently closed their businesses,
which has had an adverse impact on our business and financial condition and has hampered our ability to generate revenue and access usual
sources of liquidity on reasonable terms.

Holding Company Structure 

Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group is a Nevada
holding corporation and we conduct substantially all of our operations through our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiary. As a result, our ability
to pay dividends and to service any debt we may incur overseas largely depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiary. If our PRC subsidiary
incurs debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. 

In addition, our PRC subsidiary is permitted to
pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with the Accounting Standards for Business
Enterprise as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, or the PRC GAAP. The aggregate distributable retained earnings for our
PRC subsidiary as determined under the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise were RMB14 million and RMB24 million as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pursuant to the laws and regulations applicable to China s foreign investment enterprises, our
subsidiary that is foreign investment enterprise in the PRC has to make appropriation from their after-tax profit, as determined under
PRC GAAP, to reserve funds including (i) general reserve fund, (ii) enterprise expansion fund and (iii) staff bonus and welfare
fund. The appropriation to the general reserve fund must be at least 10 of the after-tax profits calculated in accordance with PRC
GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the reserve fund has reached 50 of the registered capital of our subsidiary. As of the date of
this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary has contributed 50 of the registered capital to general reserve fund. Appropriation to the other
two reserve funds are at our subsidiary s discretion. Our PRC subsidiaries did not make any contributions to the enterprise expansion
fund or the staff and bonus welfare fund during each period presented. The restricted amounts of our PRC subsidiary totaled RMB457,499
(US 65,911) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Governmental Regulation in relation to Company s business
- Regulations related to Dividend Distribution . 

As of the date of this Annual Return, our PRC
subsidiary, distributed USD7.1 million (net of withhold tax at USD789,608 charged at a rate of 10 of the declared dividend) to its holding
parent Hong Kong subsidiary. As long as meeting the above-mentioned requirements, there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends
for our China subsidiary to its Hong Kong parent company, and there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends for our Hong
Kong subsidiary to its US parent holding company. 

Recent Regulatory Developments 

Regulations on Overseas Listings 

On July 6, 2021, Opinions on Severely Cracking
Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law was jointly issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and the General Office of the State Council, which stepped up scrutiny of overseas listings by companies and calls for strengthening
cooperation in cross-border regulation, improving relevant laws and regulations on cyber security, cross-border data transmission and
confidential information management, including the confidentiality requirement and file management related to the issuance and listing
of securities overseas, enforcing the primary responsibility of the enterprises for information security of China-based overseas-listed
companies and promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed
companies. 

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the
Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic (the Overseas

China and contemplates to offer or list its securities in an overseas market based on its onshore equities, assets or similar interests,
are required to file with the CSRC within three business days after its application for overseas listing is submitted. Furthermore,
if any PRC company that has directly or indirectly listed securities in overseas markets conducts follow-on offering of securities in
such overseas markets, it shall fulfill the filing procedures with and report relevant information to the CSRC, too. Failure to

Licenses, Permits
and Government Regulations 

PRC Legal System 

The PRC legal system
is a civil law system based on the PRC Constitution and is made up of written laws, regulations and directives. Unlike in the US where
the law built partly upon decisions of common law cases, court cases in the PRC do not constitute binding precedents. The governmental
directives are organized in the following hierarchy. 

The National People s
Congress of the PRC NPC and the Standing Committee of the NPC are empowered by the PRC Constitution to exercise the legislative
power of the state. The NPC has the power to amend the PRC Constitution and to enact and amend primary laws governing the state organs
and civil and criminal matters. The Standing Committee of the NPC is empowered to interpret, enact and amend laws other than those required
to be enacted by the NPC. 

The State Council of
the PRC is the highest organ of state administration and has the power to enact administrative rules and regulations. Ministries and commissions
under the State Council of the PRC are also vested with the power to issue orders, directives and regulations within the jurisdiction
of their respective departments. Administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders promulgated by the State Council and its ministries
and commissions must not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution or the national laws and, in the event that any conflict arises, the
Standing Committee of the NPC has the power to annul such administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders. 

At the regional level,
the people s congresses of provinces and municipalities and their standing committees may enact local rules and regulations and
the people s government may promulgate administrative rules and directives applicable to their own administrative area. These local
laws and regulations may not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution, any national laws or any administrative rules and regulations promulgated
by the State Council. 

Rules, regulations or
directives may be enacted or issued at the provincial or municipal level or by the State Council of the PRC or its ministries and commissions
in the first instance for experimental purposes. After sufficient experience has been gained, the State Council may submit legislative
proposals to be considered by the NPC or the Standing Committee of the NPC for enactment at the national level. 

Governmental Regulations in Relation to our
Businesses 

This section set forth a summary of the principal
PRC laws and regulations relevant to our business and operations in China. 

Cybersecurity Measures 

On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration
of China published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which became effective on February 15, 2022 and replace the current Measures
for Cybersecurity Review promulgated on April 13, 2020. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) specifies that the procurement of
network products and services by operator of critical information infrastructure and the activities of data process carried out by Internet
platform operator that raise or may raise national security concerns are subject to strict cyber security review by Cybersecurity
Review Office established by the CAC. Before a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services,
it should assess the potential risk of national security that may be caused by the use of such products and services. If such use of products
and services may give raise to national security concerns, it should apply for a cyber security review by the Cybersecurity Review Office
and a report of analysis of the potential effect on national security shall be submitted when the application is made. In addition, Internet
platform operators that possess the personal data of over one million users must apply for a review by the Cybersecurity Review Office,
if they plan to list their companies in foreign countries. The CAC may voluntarily conduct cyber security review if any network products
and services and activities of data process affects or may affect national security. It may take approximately 70 business days in maximum
for the general cybersecurity review upon the delivery of their applications, which may be subject to extensions for a special review.
We will not be subject to cybersecurity review with the CAC under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), on the basis that (i)
we currently do not have over one million users personal information and do not anticipate that we will be collecting over one
million users personal information in the foreseeable future, which we understand might otherwise subject us to the Measures for
Cybersecurity Review (2021); (ii) our PRC subsidiary s business operations do not involve any Critical Information Infrastructure,
and (iii) neither we nor the PRC subsidiary has received any notification from applicable PRC governmental authorities indicating that
any of the PRC subsidiary s products or services is determined as the Critical Information Infrastructure. 

20 

In addition, on November 14, 2021, the Administration
Regulations on Cyber Data Security (Draft for Comments) () (the Draft Regulation was proposed by the CAC for public comments until December 13, 2021. The Draft Regulation
stipulates that data processors which process the personal information of at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review
if they plan to list their companies in foreign countries, and the Draft Regulation further require the data processors that carry out
the following activities to apply for cybersecurity review in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations: (i) the merger, reorganization
or division of internet platform operators that have gathered a large number of data resources related to national security, economic
development and public interests affects or may affect national security; (ii) the listing of the data processor in Hong Kong affects
or may affect the national security; and (iii) other data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. Any failure
to comply with such requirements may subject us to, among others, suspension of services, fines, revoking relevant business permits or
business licenses and penalties. Since the CAC is still seeking comments on the Draft Regulation from the public as of the date of the
Annual Report, the Draft Regulation (especially its operative provisions) and its anticipated adoption or effective date are subject to
further changes with substantial uncertainty. 

As the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021)
and the Draft Regulation are newly published, the exact scope of critical information infrastructure operators and data
processing operators under the draft measures and the current regulatory regime remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities
may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws. Currently, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021)
and the Draft Regulation have not materially affected our business and operations, but in anticipation of the strengthened implementation
of cybersecurity laws and regulations and the continued expansion of our business, our PRC subsidiary faces potential risks if we are
deemed as a critical information infrastructure operator or data processing operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations.
In such case, we must fulfill certain obligations as required under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, including, among others,
storing personal information and other important data collected and produced within the PRC territory as part of our operations in China
(as we currently do in our operations), and we may be subject to lengthy cybersecurity review and other enhanced regulatory requirements
when purchasing internet products and services or conducting data processing activities. We may face challenges in addressing such enhanced
regulatory requirements and make necessary changes to our internal policies and practices in data privacy and cybersecurity matters. See
 Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our PRC subsidiary may be
liable for improper collection, use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers and employees and Risk
Factors Risks associated with doing business in China Uncertainties exist with respect to
the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations with respect to online platform business operation. 

As of the date of this
filing of the Annual Report, our operating subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated
by the Cyberspace Administration of China based on the draft measures, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions
in such respect or any regulatory objections to this registration. As of the date of this Annual Report, recent regulatory actions by
China s government related to data security have not materially impacted our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investments
or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges. 

Regulations Related to Foreign Investment 

Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign
Investment 

Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors
are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment , or the Guidance Catalog, which was
promulgated and is amended from time to time by Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or
NDRC. The Guidance Catalog lays out the basic framework for foreign investment in China, classifying businesses into three categories
with regard to foreign investment: encourage, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed
in the catalog are generally deemed as falling into a fourth category permitted unless specifically restricted by other
PRC laws. 

In addition, in June 2018 the MOFCOM and the NDRC
promulgated the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment , or the Negative List, which
became effective on July 28, 2018 and was further updated on June 30, 2019 and June 23, 2020. 

21 

Foreign Investment Law 

On March 15, 2019, the
National People s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which
came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign
Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC , the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and
the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law of the PRC , together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
The organization form, organization and activities of foreign-invested enterprises shall be governed, among others, by the PRC
Company Law and the PRC Partnership Enterprise Law. Foreign-invested enterprises established before the implementation
of the Foreign Investment Law may retain the original business organization and so on within five years after the implementation of this
Law. 

The Foreign Investment
Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the legitimate rights and interests
of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry national treatment and are
subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign investors and their
investments at the stage of investment access shall not be less favorable than that of domestic investors and their investments. The negative
list management system means that the state implements special administrative measures for access of foreign investment in specific fields. 

Foreign investors 
investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China shall be protected in accordance with the
law, and all national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. Among
others, the state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner and that
foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. Further,
the state shall not expropriate any foreign investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy
or expropriate the investment of foreign investors in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation
and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying
out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection. 

The Implementation Regulations of Foreign
Investment Law of the PRC , adopted by the State Council on December 26, 2019 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides implementing
measures and detailed rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. 

Regulations Related to Mobile Internet Applications
Information Services 

Mobile Internet applications and application stores
are specifically regulated by the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services , or the App
Provisions, which were promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, on June 28, 2016, and became effective on August
1, 2016. Pursuant to the App Provisions, application information service providers shall obtain the relevant qualifications prescribed
by laws and regulations, strictly implement their information security management responsibilities and carry out certain duties, including
establishing and completing user information security protection mechanism and information content inspection and management mechanisms,
protect users right to know and to choose in the process of usage, and to record and preserve users daily usage information
for at least 60 days. Furthermore, internet application store service providers and internet application information service providers
shall sign service agreements to determinate both sides rights and obligations. 

In addition, on December 16, 2016, the MIIT promulgated
the Interim Measures on the Administration of Pre-Installation and Distribution of Applications for Mobile Smart Terminals ,
or the App Interim Measures, which took effect on July 1, 2017. The App Interim Measures requires, among others, that internet information
service providers must ensure that a mobile application, as well as its ancillary resource files, configuration files and user data can
be uninstalled by a user on a convenient basis, unless it is a basic function software, which refers to a software that supports the normal
functioning of hardware and operating system of a mobile smart device. 

Neither the App Provisions nor the App Interim
Measures, however, has further clarified the scope of information services, neither do they specify what relevant
qualification(s) that an app owner/operator must obtain. In practice, operational activities of a company conducted through an
app is currently subject to the supervisions of local departments of the Information Communications Administration, and often, the local
departments differentiate the operational activities conducted through websites and through apps. 

As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received
any inquiry or notice from the PRC government concerning our compliance of such regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the
PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours.

Regulations Related to Online Transmission
of Audio-Visual Programs 

On April 13, 2005, the State Council promulgated
the Certain Decisions on the Entry of the Non-state-owned Capital into the Cultural Industry . On July 6, 2005, five PRC governmental
authorities, including the Ministry of Culture, or the MOC, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or the SARFT (the
predecessor of the National Radio and Television Administration, or NRTA), the General Administration of Press and Publication, or the
GAPP, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC and the MOFCOM, jointly adopted the Several Opinions on Canvassing
Foreign Investment into the Cultural Sector . Under these provisions, non-state owned capital and foreign investors are prohibited
from engaging in the business of distributing audio-visual programs through information networks. 

To further regulate the provision of audio-visual
program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within the territory of the PRC, the SARFT and the
MIIT jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service , or the Audio-Visual Program
Provisions, on December 20, 2007, which took effect on January 31, 2008 and subsequently amended on August 28, 2015. Pursuant to the Audio-Visual
Program Provisions, Internet audio-visual program services refer to activities of making, redacting and integrating audio-visual programs,
providing them to the general public via the Internet, and providing platforms for uploading and spreading audio-visual programs. Providers
of internet audio-visual program services are required to obtain the Audio-Visual License issued by SARFT, or complete certain registration
procedures with SARFT. In general, providers of internet audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled
entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual
program service determined by SARFT. Our subsidiaries is neither state-owned nor state-controlled, therefore it is unlikely that it will
be able to obtain the Audio-Visual License if required to do so. Whoever engages in Internet audio-visual program service without the
license or registration, the competent authorities shall give it/him an admonition and order it/him to correct, and may impose a fine
of not more than RMB30,000 (approximately US 4,348); if the circumstances are serious, a punishment shall be imposed in accordance with
the provision of Article 47 of the Radio and Television Administration Regulation . 

On May 21, 2008, SARFT issued a Notice
on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs , as amended
on August 28, 2015, which further set out detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the Audio-Visual
License. Further, on March 31, 2009, SARFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet
Audio-Visual Programs , which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet,
including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing violence,
pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements. 

On March 17, 2010, the SARFT issued the Internet
Audio-visual Program Services Categories (Provisional) , or the Provisional Categories, as amended on March 10, 2017. According to
the Provisional Categories, there are four categories of internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen
sub-categories. The third sub-category to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs
concerning, among other things, finance and educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. However,
there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, in
particular, the scope of internet audio-visual programs . 

In addition, the Notice concerning Strengthening
the Administration of the Streaming Service of Online Audio-Visual Programs promulgated by the State Administration of Press
and Publication Radio, Film and Television, or the SAPPRFT (the predecessor of NRTA) on September 2, 2016 emphasizes that, unless a specific
license is granted, audio-visual programs service provider is forbidden from engaging in live streaming on major political, military,
economic, social, cultural and sports events. On November 4, 2016, the State Internet Information Office promulgated the Administrative
Provisions on Internet Live-Streaming Services , or Internet Live-Streaming Services Provisions, which came into effect on December
1, 2016. According to the Internet Live-Streaming Services Provisions, an internet live-streaming service provider shall (a) establish
a live-streaming content review platform; (b) conduct authentication registration of internet live-streaming issuers based on their identity
certificates, business licenses and organization code certificates; and (c) enter into a service agreement with internet live-streaming
services user to specify both parties rights and obligations. 

On March 16, 2018, the SAPPRFT issued the Notice
on Further Regulating the Transmission Order of Internet Audio-Visual Programs , which requires that, among others, audio-visual platforms
shall: (i) not produce or transmit programs intended to parody or denigrate classic works, (ii) not re-edit, re-dub, re-caption or otherwise. 

As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received
any inquiry or notice from the PRC government concerning our compliance of such regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the
PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours.

Regulation on Information Protection on Networks 

On December 28, 2012, SCNPC issued Decision of
the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress on Strengthening Information Protection on Networks, pursuant to which
network service providers and other enterprises and institutions shall, when gathering and using electronic personal information of citizens
in business activities, publish their collection and use rules and adhere to the principles of legality, rationality and necessarily,
explicitly state the purposes, manners and scopes of collecting and using information, and obtain the consent of those from whom information
is collected, and shall not collect and use information in violation of laws and regulations and the agreement between both sides; and
the network service providers and other enterprises and institutions and their personnel must strictly keep such information confidential
and may not divulge, alter, damage, sell, or illegally provide others with such information. 

On July 16, 2013, the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, or the MIIT, issued the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet
User, which was effective as of September 1, 2013. The requirements under this order are stricter and wider compared to the above decision
issued by the National People s Congress. According to the provisions, if a network service provider wishes to collect or use personal
information, it may do so only if such collection is necessary for the services it provides. Furthermore, it must disclose to its users
the purpose, method and scope of any such collection or usage, and must obtain consent from the users whose information is being collected
or used. Network service providers are also required to establish and publish their protocols relating to personal information collection
or usage, keep any collected information strictly confidential and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such
information. Network service providers are required to cease any collection or usage of the relevant personal information, and provide
services for the users to de-register the relevant user account, when a user stops using the relevant Internet service. Network service
providers are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such
personal information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if a network service provider appoints an agent to undertake any marketing
or technical services that involve the collection or usage of personal information, the network service provider is required to supervise
and manage the protection of the information. The provisions state, in broad terms, that violators may face warnings, fines, public exposure
and, criminal liability whereas the case constitutes a crime. 

On June 1, 2017, the Cybersecurity Law of the
PRC promulgated in November, 2016 by SCNPC became effective. This law also absorbed and restated the principles and requirements mentioned
in the aforesaid decision and order, and further provides that, where an individual finds any network operator collects or uses his or
her personal information in violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or the agreement of both parties, the individual shall
be entitled to request the network operator to delete his or her personal information; if the individual finds that his or her personal
information collected or stored by the network operator has any error, he or she shall be entitled to request the network operator to
make corrections, and the network operator shall take measures to do so. Pursuant to this law, the violators may be subject to: (i) warning;
(ii) confiscation of illegal gains and fines equal to one to ten times of the illegal gains; or if without illegal gains, fines up to
RMB1,000,000; or (iii) an order to shut down the website, suspend the business operation for rectification, or revoke the business license.
In addition, responsible persons may be subject to fines between RMB10,000 and RMB100,000. 

On August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of
the National People s Congress promulgated the E-commerce Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2019. The E-commerce Law imposes
a series of requirements on e-commerce operators including e-commerce platform operators, merchants operating on the platform and the
individuals and entities carrying out business online. The governance measures that we adopt in response to the enhanced regulatory requirements
may fail to meet these requirements and may lead to penalties or our loss of merchants to those platforms, or to complaints or claims
made against us by customers on our platforms. 

In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of
China, the National Development and Reform Commission, MIIT, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry
of Finance, MOC, the People s Bank of China, SAMR, the National Radio and Television Administration, the National Administration
of State Secrets Protection, the National Cryptography Administration promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect
on June 1, 2020. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provides that the operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity
review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. 

24 

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the
National People s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law ),
which has been taken effect on September 1, 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities
and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance
of data in economic and social development, as well as the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate
rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used.
The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security
and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation
of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will comply with such regulations in all respects and we may be ordered to
rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities. We may also become subject to fines and/or other sanctions
which may have material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 

On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of
the National People s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law ),
or the PIPL, which will take effect in November 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the
PIPL specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information
that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety
of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal
whereabouts and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there
is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information
processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing
such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individual s rights and interests. 

On December 28, 2021, the CAC published the Measures
for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which became effective on February 15, 2022 and replace the Measures for Cybersecurity Review promulgated
on April 13, 2020. The Measures for Cyber Security Review (2021) specifies that the procurement of network products and services by operator
of critical information infrastructure and the activities of data process carried out by Internet platform operator that raise or may
raise national security concerns are subject to strict cyber security review by Cybersecurity Review Office established
by the CAC. Before critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services, it should assess the potential
risk of national security that may be caused by the use of such products and services. If such use of products and services may give raise
to national security concerns, it should apply for a cybersecurity review by the Cybersecurity Review Office and a report of analysis
of the potential effect on national security shall be submitted when the application is made. In addition, Internet platform operators
that possess the personal data of over one million users must apply for a review by the Cybersecurity Review Office, if they plan to list
their companies in foreign countries. The CAC may voluntarily conduct cyber security review if any network products and services and activities
of data process affects or may affect national security. It may take approximately 70 business days in maximum for the general cybersecurity
review upon the delivery of their applications, which may be subject to extensions for a special review. 

As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC
subsidiary has not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it is subject to a cybersecurity review. As
there remains significant uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we cannot
assure you that we would not be subject to such cybersecurity review requirement, and if so, that we would be able to pass such review
in relation to this registration. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations launched by
PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance
with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including suspension of business, website closure, removal
of our app from the relevant app stores, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings
or actions against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours. 

Regulations Related to Consumer Rights Protection 

The Consumer Rights and Interests Protection

on January 1, 2021 and replaced the Tort Liability Law of the PRC , provides that both internet users and internet service
providers may be liable for the wrongful acts of users who infringe the lawful rights of other parties. If an internet user utilizes internet
services to commit a tortious act, the party whose rights are infringed may request the internet service provider to take measures, such
as removing or blocking the content, or disabling the links thereto, to prevent or stop the infringement. If the internet service provider
does not take necessary measures after receiving such notice, it shall be jointly liable for any further damages suffered by the rights
holder. Furthermore, if an internet service provider fails to take necessary measures when it knows that an internet user utilizes its
internet services to infringe the lawful rights and interests of other parties, it shall be jointly liable with the internet user for
damages resulting from the infringement. 

As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received

27 

Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange 

The principal regulations governing foreign currency
exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations , promulgated by the State Council in 1996 and most recently
amended in 2008. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from State Administration
of Foreign Exchange or SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate
governmental authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital
expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular
of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 59,
which was most recently amended in 2015 and substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedures. Pursuant to SAFE
Circular 59, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange
capital accounts, and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in China, and remittance
of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval
or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible
previously. 

In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice
on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular
13, pursuant to which, instead of applying for approval regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas
direct investment from SAFE, entities and individuals may apply for such foreign exchange registrations from qualified banks. The qualified
banks, under the supervision of SAFE, may directly review the applications and conduct the registration. 

In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular
of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested
Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, a foreign-invested enterprise may, according to its actual business
needs, settle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital account for which the relevant foreign exchange administration
has confirmed monetary capital contribution rights and interests (or for which the bank has registered the injection of the monetary capital
contribution into the account). In addition, for the time being, foreign-invested enterprises are allowed to settle 100 of their foreign
exchange capital on a discretionary basis. A foreign-invested enterprise shall truthfully use its capital for its own operational purposes
within the scope of business. Where an ordinary foreign-invested enterprise makes domestic equity investment with the amount of foreign
exchanges settled, the invested enterprise must first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding account
for foreign exchange settlement pending payment with the foreign exchange administration or the bank at the place where it is registered. 

In June 2016, SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16,
pursuant to which, in addition to foreign currency capital, enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts, as well
as repatriated fund raised through overseas listing, from foreign currency to Renminbi on a discretional basis. SAFE Circular 16 also
reiterates that the use of capital so converted shall follow the principle of authenticity and self-use within the business
scope of the enterprise. According to SAFE Circular 16, the Renminbi funds so converted shall not be used for the purposes of, whether
directly or indirectly, (i) paying expenditures beyond the business scope of the enterprises or prohibited by laws and regulations; (ii)
making securities investment or other investments (except for banks principal-secured products); (iii) granting loans to non-affiliated
enterprises, except as expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) purchasing non-self-used real estate (except for the foreign-invested
real estate enterprises). 

In January 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Optimizing Genuineness and Compliance Verification, or SAFE
Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities
to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution,
the original version of tax filing records, and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account
for previous years losses before remitting the profits. Further, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed
explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing
the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment. 

28 

On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued the Circular
of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment , or SAFE
Circular 28, which allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic equity investment with their capital funds in accordance
with the law under the premise that such investment does not violate the existing special administrative measures (negative list) for
foreign investment and the project invested in China is authentic and compliant. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 28, upon receiving the payment
of consideration from a foreign investor for the equity transfer under foreign direct investment, the domestic transferor, with relevant
registration certificates, can process the formalities for account opening, fund receipt, and foreign exchange settlement and use directly
at the bank. The foreign investor s deposit remitted from overseas or transferred from domestic accounts can be directly used for
its lawful domestic capital contribution as well as domestic and overseas payment after the transaction is concluded. 

On April 10, 2020, SAFE issued the Circular
on Optimizing Administration of Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business , or SAFE Circular 8, pursuant
to which, eligible enterprises are allowed to use the income under capital account, from such sources as capital funds, foreign debt and
overseas listing, for domestic payment without having to provide supporting authentication materials to the banks for every transaction
in advance, but the use of funds shall be true and compliant as well as conform to the existing administration regulations regarding use
of income under capital account. The concerned bank shall conduct spot checking in accordance with the relevant requirements. 

Regulations Related to Dividend Distribution 

The principal regulations governing the distribution
of dividends paid by WFOEs include the Company Law of PRC, which applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested
companies, and the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules, which apply to foreign-invested companies. Under these regulations,
WFOEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards
and regulations. In addition, a WFOE in China is required to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards
each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reaches 50 of its registered capital. These reserve funds,
however, may not be distributed as cash dividends. 

Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Registration
of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents 

In July 2014, SAFE issued the Circular
of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and
Financing and Round-trip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles , or SAFE Circular 37 which was most recently
amended on June 15, 2018 and has replaced the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents 
Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (known as Circular 75). SAFE Circular 37 regulates foreign
exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore
investment and financing or conduct round trip investment in China. Under SAFE Circular 37, an SPV refers to an offshore entity established
or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment,
using legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests, while round trip investment refers to the direct investment in
China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights
and management rights. Circular 37 requires that, before making contribution into an SPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete
foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch. 

In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular
13. SAFE Circular 13 has amended SAFE Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks instead of SAFE
or its local branch in connection with their establishment of an SPV. 

In addition, pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, an
amendment to registration or subsequent filing with qualified banks by such PRC resident is also required if there is a material change
with respect to the capital of the offshore company, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents,
change of name and operation term of the SPV), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers
or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration requirements as set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13, misrepresent
on or failure to disclose controllers of foreign-invested enterprises that are established by round-trip investment may result in bans
on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its
offshore parent or affiliates, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations
of the PRC. 

29 

Regulations Related to Foreign Debt 

As an offshore holding company, we may make additional
capital contributions to PRC subsidiary subject to approval from the local department of commerce and the SAFE, with no limitation on
the amount of capital contributions. We may also make loans to our PRC subsidiary subject to the approval from SAFE or its local office
and the limitation on the amount of loans. 

By means of making loans, WFOE is subject to the
relevant PRC laws and regulation relating to foreign debts. On January 8, 2003, the State Development Planning Commission, SAFE, and Ministry
of Finance, or MOF, jointly promulgated the Circular on the Interim Provisions on the Management of Foreign Debts , or the
Foreign Debts Provisions, which became effective on March 1, 2003, and was partially abolished on May 10, 2015. Pursuant to Foreign Debts
Provisions, the total amount of foreign loans received by a foreign-invested company shall not exceed the difference between the total
investment in projects as approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreign-invested
company. In addition, on January 12, 2017, the People s Bank of China, or PBOC, issued the Circular on Full-Coverage Macro-Prudent
Management of Cross-Border Financing , or the PBOC Circular 9, which sets out the statutory upper limit on the foreign debts for PRC
non-financial entities, including both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested companies, and the macro-prudential adjustment
parameter is 1. Pursuant to the PBOC Circular 9, the foreign debt upper limit for both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested
companies is calculated as twice the net asset of such companies. As to net assets, the companies shall take the net assets value stated
in their latest audited financial statement. On March 11, 2020, the PBOC and SAFE promulgated the Circular of the People s
Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Adjusting the Macro-prudential Regulation Parameter for Full-covered
Cross-border Financing, which provides that based on the current macro economy and international balance of payments, the macro-prudential
regulation parameter as set forth in the PBOC Circular 9 is updated from 1 to 1.25. 

The PBOC Circular 9 does not supersede the Foreign
Debts Provisions. It provides a one-year transitional period from January 11, 2017, for foreign-invested companies, during which foreign-invested
companies, such as our PRC subsidiary, could adopt their calculation method of foreign debt upper limit based on either the Foreign Debts
Provisions or the PBOC Circular 9. The transitional period ended on January 11, 2018. Upon its expiry, pursuant to the PBOC Circular 9,
PBOC and SAFE shall reevaluate the calculation method for foreign-invested companies and determine what the applicable calculation method
would be. As of the date of this Annual Report, neither the PBOC nor SAFE has promulgated and made public any further rules, regulations,
notices, or circulars in this regard. 

Regulations Related to Tax 

Enterprise Income
Tax 

On March 16, 2007, the SCNPC promulgated the EIT
Law , which was recently amended on December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council enacted the Regulations
for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law , which was amended on April 23, 2019. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementation
regulations, both resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises are subject to the enterprise income tax so long as their income is
generated within the territory of PRC. Resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are established in China in
accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the laws of foreign countries but are actually or in effect controlled
from within the PRC. Non-resident enterprises are defined as enterprises that are organized under the laws of foreign countries
and whose actual management is conducted outside the PRC, but have established institutions or premises in the PRC, or have no such established
institutions or premises but have income generated from inside the PRC. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementing regulations, a uniform
corporate income tax rate of 25 is applied. If non-resident enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in the PRC,
or if they have formed permanent establishment or premises in the PRC but there is no actual relationship between the relevant income
derived in the PRC and the established institutions or premises set up by them, however, enterprise income tax is set at the rate of 10 
with respect to their income sourced from inside the PRC. 

The EIT Law and its implementation rules permit
certain high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state that independently own core intellectual property
and meet statutory criteria, to enjoy a reduced 15 enterprise income tax rate. 

According to the Administrative Rules
for the Certification of High Tech Enterprises , effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on January 29, 2016 (effective as of January
1, 2016), for each entity accredited as High Tech Enterprise, such status is valid for three years if it meets the qualifications for
High Tech Enterprise on a continuing basis during such period.

Value-Added Tax VAT 

The Provisional Regulations of the PRC
on Value-added Tax was promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and most recently amended on November 19, 2017.
The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were
promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were recently amended on October 28, 2011 (collectively with the VAT Regulations, the
VAT Law). On April 4, 2018, MOF and SAT jointly promulgated the Circular on Adjustment of Value-Added Tax Rates, or MOF and SAT Circular
32. On March 20, 2019, MOF, SAT and General Administration of Customs, or GAC, jointly issued a Circular on Relevant Polices for
Deepening Value-added Tax Reform , or MOF, SAT and GAC Circular 39, which became effective from April 1, 2019. According to the abovementioned
laws and circulars, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement
services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC are the taxpayers
of VAT. The VAT tax rates generally applicable are simplified as 13 , 9 , 6 and 0 , and the VAT tax rate applicable to the small-scale
taxpayers is 3 . 

Withholding Tax 

The Enterprise
Income Tax Law of the PRC provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10 will normally be applicable to dividends
declared to non-PRC resident investors which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment
or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such
dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. 

Pursuant to an Arrangement
Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention
of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes , or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong
Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under
such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10 withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise
receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5 . Based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement
of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties , or the SAT Circular 81, issued on February 20, 2009, by the SAT, however, if the relevant
PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement
that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on
Several Questions regarding the Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties , which was issued on February 3, 2018, by the SAT and
took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant s status of the beneficial owner regarding tax treatments
in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant
is obligated to pay more than 50 of his or her income in 12 months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated
by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not
levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will
be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to
prove his or her status of the beneficial owner shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according
to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers Enjoyment of the Treatment
under Tax Agreements . 

Tax on Indirect
Transfer 

On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Circular
on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises , or SAT Circular 7. Pursuant to
SAT Circular 7, an indirect transfer of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident
enterprises, may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable
commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from
such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. When determining whether there is a reasonable commercial purpose 
of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include, inter alia, whether the main value of the equity interest
of the relevant offshore enterprise derives directly or indirectly from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore
enterprise mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income is mainly derived from China; and whether the offshore
enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their
actual function and risk exposure. According to SAT Circular 7, where the transferee fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor
shall declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject
the transferor to default interest. SAT Circular 7 does not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock
exchange where such shares were acquired on a public stock exchange. On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Circular on Issues
of Tax Withholding regarding Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax , or SAT Circular 37, which further elaborates the relevant implemental
rules regarding the calculation, reporting and payment obligations of the withholding tax by the non-resident enterprises. Nonetheless,
there remain uncertainties as to the interpretation and application of SAT Circular 7. SAT Circular 7 may be determined by the tax authorities
to be applicable to our offshore transactions or sale of our shares or those of our offshore subsidiaries where non-resident enterprises,
being the transferors, were involved.

Regulations Related to Employment and Social
Welfare 

Employment 

The Labor Law of the PRC , which was
promulgated on July 5, 1994, effective since January 1, 1995, and most recently amended on December 29, 2018, the Labor Contract
Law of the PRC , which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, and amended on December 28, 2012, and the Implementation Regulations
of the Labor Contract Law of the PRC , which was promulgated on September 18, 2008, are the principal regulations that govern employment
and labor matters in the PRC. Under the above regulations, labor contracts shall be concluded in writing if labor relationships are to
be or have been established between employers and the employees. Employers are prohibited from forcing employees to work above certain
time limit and employers shall pay employees for overtime work in accordance to national regulations. In addition, wages may not be lower
than the local minimum wage. Employers must establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state standards, and
provide relevant education to its employees. Employees are also required to work in safe and sanitary conditions. 

Social Insurance
and Housing Fund 

Under the Social Insurance Law of the
PRC that was promulgated by the SCNPC on October 28, 2010, and came into force as of July 1, 2011, and was most recently amended
on December 29, 2018 (also the effective date), together with other laws and regulations, employers are required to pay basic pension
insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, employment injury insurance, maternity insurance, and other social insurance
for its employees at specified percentages of the salaries of the employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government
regulations from time to time. When an employer fails to fully pay social insurance premiums, relevant social insurance collection agency
shall order it to make up for any shortfall within a prescribed time limit, and may impose a late payment fee at the rate of 0.05 per
day of the outstanding amount from the due date. If such employer still fails to make up for the shortfalls within the prescribed time
limit, the relevant administrative authorities shall impose a fine of one to three times the outstanding amount upon such employer. 

In accordance with the Regulations on
the Management of Housing Fund which was promulgated by the State Council in 1999 and most recently amended in March 2019 (which
became effective as of March 24, 2019), employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for
depositing employees housing funds. Employer and employee are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no
less than 5 of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time. 

Our PRC subsidiary failed to deposit adequate
contributions to the housing funds for all of its employees, but has not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or
other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities for non-compliance on labor-related laws and regulations. As a remediation,
our PRC subsidiary started to deposit the adequate contributions to the housing funds from July 2021 onwards. Before July 2021, our PRC
subsidiary failed to deposit adequate contributions of housing provident fund for all employees in accordance with Article 15 of the regulations
on the administration of housing provident fund. As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary did not receive any warning
and punishment notice from the authority. If any employee reports the non-compliance to the authority later, it will be handled in accordance
with Article 38 of the regulations on the administration of housing provident fund, which is that the housing provident fund management
center shall order our Chinese subsidiary to deposit or make up the payment within a time limit; and if our Chinese subsidiary fails to
pay or make up the payment within the time limit, the reporting employee may apply to the people s court for enforcement. 

Regulations Related to Mergers and Acquisitions
and Overseas Listings 

On August 8, 2006, six PRC governmental and regulatory
agencies, including MOFCOM and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, promulgated the Rules on Acquisition of
Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors , or the M A Rules, governing the mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by
foreign investors that became effective on September 8, 2006, and was amended on June 22, 2009. The M A Rules, among other things,
requires that offshore SPVs that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals and that have been formed for overseas listing purposes
through acquisitions of PRC domestic interest held by such PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly
listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange.

department, and 9 in administration. 

We
maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty
in recruiting employees for our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 

Our
employees are all in China and participate in the state pension plan organized by the Chinese municipal and provincial government. Our
PRC subsidiary is required by Chinese law to cover employees in China with various types of social insurance. We believe that we are
in material compliance with the relevant PRC laws. 

Legal
Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
The Company is not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually
or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined
adversely to us. 

Smaller
Reporting Company 

The
Company is a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available
to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of
audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a smaller reporting company ,
these exemptions will continue to be available to us. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

As
a public company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company 
under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). An emerging growth company may take advantage of
certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable
to public companies, and can avail itself to various exemptions such as an exemption from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and Section 14(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

In
particular, as an emerging growth company, the Company: 

is not
 required to obtain an attestation and report from its auditors on our management s assessment of the Company s internal
 control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

is not
 required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing its compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing
 how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as compensation discussion and analysis 

is not
 required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from its stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly
 referred to as the say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden-parachute votes); 

is exempt
 from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 

may present
 only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial
 Condition and Results of Operations MD A and 

is eligible
 to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under 107 of the JOBS Act. 

34 

The
Company intends to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods
for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under 107 of the JOBS Act. The Company s election to use
the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare its financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging
growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under 107 of the JOBS Act. 

Certain
of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to the Company due to the fact that it also qualifies as
a smaller reporting company under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor
attestation and report regarding management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide
a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio
disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD A disclosure. 

Under
the JOBS Act, the Company may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years
after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act ), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company.
In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that the Company would cease to be an emerging growth company if it has more than
 1.235 billion in annual revenues, have more than 700 million in market value of its Common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue
more than 1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. The Company would cease to be an emerging
growth company on the last day of the fiscal year following the date of the fifth anniversary of its first sale of common equity securities
under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or a fiscal year in which we have 1 billion in gross revenues. Further,
under current SEC rules the Company will continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company for so long as it has a public
float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than 250 million as of the last business day of its most
recently completed second fiscal quarter.

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

We
have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by development-stage companies. 

We,
through our operating PRC subsidiary in China, have been in business since October 2019 as a consulting company, which mainly focuses
on includes digital marketing consulting and KOL Training Related Services. We have only been profitable since the year ended December
31, 2019. As a development-stage company, our business strategies and model are constantly being tested by the market and operating results,
and we work to adjust our allocation of resources accordingly. As such, our business may be subject to significant fluctuations in operating
results in terms of amounts of revenues and the percentages of the total revenue with respect to the business segments. 

We
are, and expect for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties, inherent in a development-stage business.
As a result, we must establish many functions necessary to operate a business, including expanding our managerial and administrative
structure, assessing and implementing our marketing program, implementing financial systems and controls and personnel recruitment. There
are risks in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies with a limited operating
history. These risks and challenges are, among other things: 

we
operate in industries that are or may in the future be subject to increasing regulation by various governmental agencies in China; 

we may not be able
 to resume our KOL Training Related Services; 

35 

we may require additional
 capital to develop and expand our operations which may not be available to us when we require it; 

our marketing and growth
 strategy may not be successful; 

our business may be subject
 to significant fluctuations in operating results; and 

we may not be able to attract,
 retain and motivate qualified professionals. 

Our
future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this registration statement.
If we do not successfully address these risks, our business would be significantly harmed. 

Our
historical financial results may not be indicative of our future performance. 

Our
business has achieved rapid growth in 2019 and 2020 since we launched our new business model of providing digital marketing consultation
in 2019. Our revenue was 3,507,590 and 5,637,396 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our net income was 404,618
and 1,086,400 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, our historical growth rate and the limited history
of operation make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. We may not be able to sustain our historically growth or may not be
able to grow our business at all. 

If
we cannot manage our growth effectively and efficiently, our results of operations or profitability could be adversely affected. 

We
have been in business since October 2019 as a consulting company. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 was 3,507,590 compared
to 5,637,396 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2,129,806 or 37.8 as compared with the prior year. The
decrease was mainly due to change in end customers preference during the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of new Delta virus
in China increased the inherent risk of the business. Our planned expansion will place significant demands on us to maintain the quality
of our consulting services to ensure that our brand does not suffer as a result of any deviations, whether actual or perceived, in the
quality of our services. In order to manage and support our growth, we must continue to improve our existing operational and administrative
systems and our quality control, and recruit, train and retain additional qualified professionals as well as other administrative and
sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to effectively and efficiently manage the growth of our operations, recruit and retain
qualified personnel and integrate new expansion into our operations. As a result, our quality of service may deteriorate and our results
of operations or profitability could be adversely affected. 

We
may not be successful in implementing important new strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial
results. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result
in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. For example, our KOL training program in Influencer Marketing may not be
able to train trainees to become KOLs or we may have to suspend our KOL Training Related Services as a result of suspension of programs
by our partners. 

Our
management may lack required experience, knowledge, insight, or human and capital resources to carry out the effective implementation
to expand into new spaces outside of our current focuses. As such, we may not be able to realize our expected growth, and our business
and financial results will be adversely impacted. 

36 

Increasing
competition within our industries could have an impact on our business prospects. 

The
digital marketing consulting business and KOL training academy business are industries where new competitors can easily enter into since
there are no significant barriers to entry. Our operating subsidiaries also face many competitors in the marketing consulting industry
where a number of competitors have been in business longer than us. Competing companies may have significantly greater financial and
other resources than we have and may offer services that are more attractive to prospective clients; increased competition would have
a negative impact on both our revenues and our profit margins. 

Our
PRC subsidiary may be required to obtain and maintain additional approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business, which could
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 

Our
business is subject to governmental supervision and regulation by the relevant PRC governmental authorities, including the Ministry of
Commerce, or MOFCOM, and other governmental authorities in charge of the relevant categories of services offered by us. 

The
laws and regulations and government policy changes rapidly on digital training. For our digital training related services, we worked
with Beida Jade Bird Vocational Education Jade Bird which was an authorized licensee of China National Personal Talent
Training Network CNPTTN ), a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training. Jade Bird was in charge of its training courses,
and the Company was authorised by Jade Bird as its sole training related administrator of the training courses, limited to coordinate
the digital training related services to individual clients who were interested in conducting live-broadcasting business through social
medias. The Company provided training related services, to these individual clients who subscribed courses, in arranging the examination,
following up certificate issuance processes, addressing clients concerns, etc. On March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that
Jade Bird suspended its service after receiving a notice from CNPTTN that until further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services
using its CNPTTN s name. As a result of CNPTTN s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related
services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022 until further notice. In the future, laws and regulations and the CNPTTN may require our
PRC Subsidiary to meet additional requirements or obtain additional approvals, licenses or permits to conduct KOL training related business.
If our PRC Subsidiary is unable to meet the relevant requirements or obtain the relevant approvals, licenses or permits, our PRC Subsidiary
may not be able to continue to conduct the KOL training related business. As of the date of this Annual Report, there is no further notice
from CNPTTN and the service is still being suspended. 

If
our operating subsidiaries fail to hire, train or retain qualified managerial and other employees, our business and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. 

We
place substantial reliance on the digital marketing consulting service industry experience and knowledge of our senior management team
as well as their relationships with other industry participants. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management
could hinder our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our growth strategies. Finding suitable replacements for our
current senior management could be difficult, and competition for such personnel of similar experience is intense. If we fail to retain
our senior management, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our
personnel are critical to maintaining the quality and consistency of our services, brand and reputation. It is important for us to attract
qualified managerial and other employees who have experience in consulting services and are committed to our service approach. There
may be a limited supply of such qualified individuals. We must hire and train qualified managerial and other employees on a timely basis
to keep pace with our rapid growth while maintaining consistent quality of services across our operations. We must also provide continuous
training to our managerial and other employees so that they are equipped with up-to-date knowledge of various aspects of our operations
and can meet our demand for high-quality services. If we fail to do so, the quality of our services may decrease, which in turn, may
cause a negative perception of our brand and adversely affect our business. 

37 

Risks
associated with doing business in China 

The
recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and
future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a
material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company s common stock, including potentially
causing the value of the Company s common stock decline or be worthless. 

The
Chinese government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our
operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. To the extent that the cash and
assets in our business are in our PRC subsidiary and/or Hong Kong subsidiary, the funds or assets may not be available to fund
operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to intervention in or the imposition of restrictions and
limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the Chinese government to transfer cash or assets. Any such intervention in
or influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight and control over the cash or assets of our subsidiaries,
once taken by the Chinese government, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the
value of our stock, or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. 

The
Chinese government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet
industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding the marketing
consulting industry that could require us to seek permission from Chinese authorities to continue to operate our business, which may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, recent statements made by the Chinese government
have indicated an intent to increase the government s oversight and control over offerings of companies with significant operations
in China that are to be conducted in foreign markets, as well as foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Any such action,
if taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer common stocks
to our investors and could cause the value of the Company s common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. 

Recently,
the Chinese government announced that it would step up supervision of Chinese companies listed offshore. Under the new measures, China
will improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent
securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and
control leverage ratios. The Cyberspace Administration of China CAC has also opened a cybersecurity probe into several
U.S.-listed tech giants focusing on anti-monopoly, financial technology regulation and more recently, with the passage of the Data Security
Law, how companies collect, store, process and transfer data. 

Though
the Company is a Nevada corporation, we through our PRC subsidiary, are headquartered and have operations in China. We currently do not,
and we do not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. However,
because our operations are in China and our major shareholders are located in China, there is always a risk that the Chinese government
may in the future seek to intervene or influence operations of any company with any level of operations in China, including its ability
to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment.
In light of China s recent announcements, there are risks and uncertainties which we cannot foresee for the time being, and rules
and regulations in China can change quickly with little or no advance notice. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our PRC
subsidiary s current and future operations in China at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or
foreign investment in issuers likes ourselves. 

If
any or all of the foregoing were to occur, this could lead to a material change in the Company s operations and/or the value of
its common stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and
cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

The
CSRC has released for public consultation the draft rules for China-based companies seeking to conduct initial public offerings in foreign
markets. While such rules have not yet gone into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that
are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability
to offer or continue to offer the Company s common stock to investors and could cause the value of the Company s common stock
to significantly decline or become worthless. 

38 

On
December 24, 2021, the CSRC released the Administrative Provisions of the State Council Regarding the Overseas Issuance and Listing of
Securities by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the Draft Administrative Provisions and the Measures for the
Overseas Issuance of Securities and Listing Record-Filings by Domestic Enterprises (Draft for Comments) (the Draft Filing Measures, 
collectively with the Draft Administrative Provisions, the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing ), both of which have
a comment period that expired on January 23, 2022. The Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing lay out the filing regulation arrangement
for both direct and indirect overseas listing, and clarify the determination criteria for indirect overseas listing in overseas markets. 

The
Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing stipulate that the Chinese-based companies, or the issuer, shall fulfill the filing procedures
within three working days after the issuer makes an application for an initial public offering and listing in an overseas market. The
required filing materials for an initial public offering and listing should include at least the following: record-filing report and
related undertakings; regulatory opinions, record-filing, approval and other documents issued by competent regulatory authorities of
relevant industries (if applicable); security assessment opinion issued by relevant regulatory authorities (if applicable); PRC legal
opinion; and prospectus. 

In
addition, an overseas offering and listing is prohibited under any of the following circumstances: (1) if the intended securities offering
and listing is specifically prohibited by national laws and regulations and relevant provisions; (2) if the intended securities offering
and listing may constitute a threat to or endangers national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State
Council in accordance with law; (3) if there are material ownership disputes over the equity, major assets, and core technology, etc.
of the issuer; (4) if, in the past three years, the domestic enterprise or its controlling shareholders or actual controllers have committed
corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property, or other criminal offenses disruptive to the order of the socialist
market economy, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation for suspicion
of major violations; (5) if, in the past three years, directors, supervisors, or senior executives have been subject to administrative
punishments for severe violations, or are currently under judicial investigation for suspicion of criminal offenses, or are under investigation
for suspicion of major violations; (6) other circumstances as prescribed by the State Council. The Administration Provisions defines
the legal liabilities of breaches such as failure in fulfilling filing obligations or fraudulent filing conducts, imposing a fine between
RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million, and in cases of severe violations, a parallel order to suspend relevant business or halt operation
for rectification, revoke relevant business permits or operational license. 

The
Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing, if enacted, may subject us to additional compliance requirements in the future, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to get the clearance of filing procedures under the Draft Rules Regarding Overseas Listing on a timely
basis, or at all. Any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer the Company s common stock, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and
severely damage our reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause
the Company s common stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

Uncertainties
with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in
laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us. 

Our
PRC subsidiary is incorporated under and governed by the laws of the PRC. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Prior court
decisions may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive
system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general, such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance,
commerce, taxation and trade. As a significant part of our business is conducted in China, our operations are principally governed by
PRC laws and regulations. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations
and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections
available to us. Uncertainties due to evolving laws and regulations could also impede the ability of a China-based company, such as our
company, to obtain or maintain permits or licenses required to conduct business in China. In the absence of required permits or licenses,
governmental authorities could impose material sanctions or penalties on us. In addition, some regulatory requirements issued by certain
PRC government authorities may not be consistently applied by other PRC government authorities (including local government authorities),
thus making strict compliance with all regulatory requirements impractical, or in some circumstances impossible. For example, our PRC
subsidiary may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we enjoy either by law or
contract. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual
terms, it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy
than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some
of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation
of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of
our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business
and impede our ability to continue our operations. 

39 

Furthermore,
if China adopts more stringent standards with respect to environmental protection or corporate social responsibilities, we may incur
increased compliance costs or become subject to additional restrictions in our operations. Intellectual property rights and confidentiality
protections in China may also not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. In addition, we cannot predict the effects
of future developments in the PRC legal system on our business operations, including the promulgation of new laws, or changes to existing
laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and our investors,
including you. Moreover, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and
management attention. 

The
PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations
as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. The PRC government has recently published new
policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the
possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight
and control over securities offerings and other capital markets activities that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based
companies like us. Any such intervention in or influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight and control over
securities offerings and other capital markets activities, once taken by the PRC government, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations and the value of our Stocks, or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or
continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become
worthless. 

The
PRC legal system is evolving, and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us. 

We
conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. The
PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for
reference but have limited precedential value. 

As
the legislation in China and the PRC legal system has continued to evolve rapidly over the past decades and the PRC government has made
significant progress in promulgating laws and regulations related to economic affairs and matters, for example, such laws and regulations
have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, many of these laws and
regulations are relatively new and there is a limited volume of published decisions and enactments. In particular, there exist substantial
uncertainties surrounding the evolvement, interpretation and enforcement of regulatory requirements of cybersecurity, data security,
privacy protection as well as anti-monopoly, and we may need to take certain corresponding measures to maintain our regulatory compliance,
such as adjusting the relevant business or transactions and introducing compliance experts and talents, which may incur additional related
costs and adverse impact on our business. As a result, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform
and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. Therefore,
there are uncertainties involved in their implementation and interpretation, and it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative
and court proceedings and the level of legal protection available to you and us. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope
and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, and any failure to respond to changes
in the regulatory environment in China could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations. 

40 

A
severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 

Although
the Chinese economy has grown steadily in the past decade, there is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the People s Bank of China and financial authorities of some of the world s leading
economies, including the United States and China. There have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe
and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets. There have also been concerns on the relationship among China
and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. Economic conditions
in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected
or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We
face risks related to health epidemics such as the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan city at the end of 2019, and other
outbreaks, which has significantly disrupted our operations and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

Our
business has been significantly disrupted and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics such as the COVID-19
coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan city at the end of 2019 and other outbreaks affecting the PRC. Our business operations depend
on China s overall economy and demand for our services, which could be disrupted by health epidemics. 

At
the end of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to be generally under control and business activities have recovered on the whole.
The outbreak became more stabilized in China and other regions in the world. However, sporadic cases continue to be found during the
first half year of 2021 in China. In the second quarter of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 had been found in certain cities in
China, which cause another outbreak, thus increasing risks and possible further disruption to businesses. Therefore, certain of our consulting
services were suspended from April 2021 to August 2021. We have resumed these consulting businesses from August 2021 in order to maintain
diversified services for our customers. 

As of December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although
vaccines are now being distributed and administered across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue
to emerge that have shown to be more contagious. We continue to adhere to applicable governmental and commercial restrictions and to
work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, customers, communities, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which
the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the company s business, operations and financial results from this point forward will depend on
numerous evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following: the duration and scope of
the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic in the future; and any other further
development of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

We
expect the aforementioned negative impact on our business to gradually mitigate in the coming seasons when the outbreak becomes more
stabilized in China and other regions in the world. However, there remains much uncertainty as to what extent the impact could have on
our long-term business outlook as a prolonged outbreak could significantly affect the Chinese economy and decrease the demand for our
services, which could lead to more disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes
in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon our ability to operate profitably in the PRC. 

Currently,
substantially all of our businesses are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, economic, political and legal developments in the PRC will
continue to significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Policies of the PRC government
can have significant effects on economic conditions in the PRC and the ability of businesses to operate profitably. Our ability to operate
profitably in the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including changes in laws, regulations
or their interpretation that may affect our ability to operate as currently contemplated. 

41 

Because
our business is dependent upon government policies that encourage a market-based economy, change in the political or economic climate
in the PRC may impair our ability to operate profitably, if at all. 

Although
the PRC government has been pursuing a number of economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to
exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC. Because of the nature of our business, our PRC subsidiary is dependent
upon the PRC government pursuing policies that encourage private ownership of businesses. We cannot assure you that the PRC government
will continue to pursue policies favoring a market-oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially
in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social
life in the PRC. 

Changes
in China s economic, political or social conditions or government policies may have a material adverse effect on our business and
operations. 

Substantially
all of our assets and operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
have been and will be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. The Chinese
economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level
of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented
measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and
the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still
owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development
by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China s economic growth through
allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential
treatment to particular industries or companies. 

While
the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over past three decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among
various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in
the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could
adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our products and adversely affect our competitive
position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources.
Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In
addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace
of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating
results. 

The
PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil
law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Therefore our susceptibility to such laws is unknown. 

In
1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general.
The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of
foreign investment in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws, rules and regulations
may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by
PRC regulatory agencies. In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number
of published decisions and the nonbinding nature of such decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give the relevant
regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve
uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and
internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we
may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation. 

42 

Any
administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and
contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection
we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered and
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Chinese
law prohibits or restricts companies belonging to foreign countries from operating some certain businesses. 

According
to Chinese law, some businesses are not allowed to be operated by the companies whose ownership is not a Chinese company. We are a US
company registered in Nevada. Each company in our organization chart is a subsidiary. The legality and effectiveness of this control
method are accorded with Chinese laws and regulations. On December 27, 2020, China s National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued the 2020 edition of the Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment FI encouraged catalogue ). According to the FI encouraged catalogue, Article 8, Section 425, foreign investment on the
business of consulting services is encouraged, effective on January 27, 2021. However, we are uncertain that the laws will remain to
allow foreign owned Chinese companies to engage in consultancy services business. 

The
PRC government has the ability to exert substantial control over any offering or listing of securities conducted overseas and/or foreign
investment in China-based issuers, and, as a result, may limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors, and may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

The
PRC government recently initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China, including cracking
down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using the variable
interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly
enforcement. For example, in July 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities made public the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on
Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, which emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities
and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction
of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas listed companies. 

On
February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Overseas Listing Trial Measures and five relevant guidelines which will take effect from March
31, 2023. Pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, we are required to file with the CSRC within three business days upon completion
of any subsequent securities offering in the overseas markets where our securities are currently listed on. Furthermore, if we intend
to offer or list our securities in other overseas markets, we need to file with CSRC within three business days of submitting the application
documents for the offering or listing. Failure to perform our filing obligations may result in penalties imposed on the PRC Company and
responsible officers. In addition, we shall report to the CSRC upon occurrence of certain material events, including change of control,
investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities regulatory authorities, change of listing status or transfer of listing segment,
and voluntary or mandatory delisting. 

On
February 24, 2023, the CSRC and other PRC governmental authorities jointly issued the revised Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality
and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Revised Confidentiality
Provisions ), which will come into effect on March 31, 2023. According to the Revised Confidentiality Provisions, Chinese companies
that directly or indirectly conduct overseas offerings and listings, shall strictly abide by the laws and regulations on confidentiality
when providing or publicly disclosing, either directly or through their overseas listed entities, materials to securities services providers.
In the event such materials contain state secrets or working secrets of government agencies, the Chinese companies shall first obtain
approval from authorities, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level with the approving authority; in the
event that such materials, if divulged, will jeopardize national security or public interest, the Chinese companies shall comply with
procedures stipulated by national regulations. The Chinese companies shall also provide a written statement of the specific sensitive
information provided when providing materials to securities service providers, and such written statements shall be retained for inspection.
As the Revised Confidentiality Provisions were recently promulgated and has not taken effect, their interpretation and implementation
remain substantially uncertain.

On
November 14, 2021, the CAC released the draft Regulations on Network Data Security Management (the Draft Regulations ),
which requires, among other things, that a prior cybersecurity review be conducted by the Cybersecurity Review Office before listing
overseas for data processors which process over one million users personal information, and for the listing in Hong Kong of data
processors which affect or may affect national security. Furthermore, on December 28, 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission,
the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC, and several other administrations jointly published the Revised Cybersecurity
Review Measures, which became effective on February 15, 2022 and require, among other things, that a network platform operator holding
over one million users personal information must apply with the Cybersecurity Review Office for a cybersecurity review before
any public offering or listing outside of mainland PRC and Hong Kong. 

Since
the Draft Cyber Data Security Regulations are in the process of being formulated, it remains unclear whether and how these draft rules
will ultimately be adopted, interpreted and implemented. Also, it remains unclear how the Revised Cybersecurity Review Measures will
be interpreted and implemented. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether we will be required to obtain regulatory approvals from the CAC
or any other PRC governmental authorities for offerings outside of mainland China. 

If
the CSRC, CAC or other PRC governmental authorities later promulgate new rules or interpretations requiring that we obtain their approval
for future offerings or listings outside of mainland China or for foreign investments in our securities, we may be unable to obtain such
approvals in a timely manner, or at all. Any such circumstance could significantly or completely limit our ability to raise capital through
securities offerings, hinder our ability to execute strategic plans in a timely manner or at all, and could cause the value of our securities
to significantly decline. 

We
may be subject to liability for placing advertisements with content that is deemed inappropriate or misleading under PRC laws. 

According
to Chinese law, if any advertisement issued by our PRC subsidiary infringes the rights and interests of a third party, our PRC subsidiary
shall bear the liability for compensation, which may cause us financial loss. 

Our
PRC subsidiary may be liable for improper collection, use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers amd employees. 

Though
our business involves only digital marketing consulting, not an internet platform, but we may still have the opportunity in collecting
and retaining large volumes of internal and customer data, including personal information as our various information technology systems
enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain information about various aspects of our operations as well as regarding
our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and
employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. Our PRC subsidiary is required by applicable laws to keep
strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such information.
Unauthorized access to, or improper use, disclosure, theft or destruction of, our customer or employee personal, financial or other data
or our proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could result
in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation. 

In
addition, the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations. The Chinese
government has focused increasingly on regulation in the areas of information security and protection, including by implementing the
PRC Cybersecurity Law effective June 1, 2017, which imposes tightened requirements on data privacy and cybersecurity practices. There
are uncertainties with respect to the application of the cybersecurity law in certain circumstances. In addition, the PRC Data Security
Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021, imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data
activities (including activities outside of the PRC), requires a national security review of data activities that may affect national
security, and imposes restrictions on data transmissions. Furthermore, the PRC Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect
on November 1, 2021, sets out the regulatory framework for handling and protection of personal information and transmission of personal
information. The Revised Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022, require critical information infrastructure
operators procuring network products and services and online platform operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect
or may affect national security, to conduct a cybersecurity review pursuant to the provisions therein. The Measures for Security Assessment
for Outbound Data Transfer, which took effect on September 1, 2022, mandate mandatory government security review by the CAC in advance
of certain cross-border data transfer activities. 

44 

We
attach great importance to data security, cyber security and personal information protection, and the evolvement of applicable PRC laws
and regulations therewith, and we are in compliance with laws and regulations with respect to data security, cyber security and personal
information protection in all material aspects. As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary, the main operating entity of
ours, has implemented comprehensive internal policies and measures on protection of cyber security, data privacy and personal information
to make sure its compliance with relevant PRC laws and regulations. The main internal policies and measures are as follows: (i)
for customer data processing, our PRC subsidiary deploys the access control mechanism on the server side, adopts the principle
of minimum authorization for the staff who may contact end users personal data; (ii) our PRC subsidiary s operating
systems and database systems have password complexity requirements; (iii) our PRC subsidiary has established Information Security
Committee and appoints the CEO, Mr. Tao Guolin to be the head of the committee; (iv) our PRC subsidiary has formulated a cybersecurity
contingency plan and will conduct training and safety drills every year in preparation for any emergency cybersecurity incidents; (v) our
PRC subsidiary has established data privacy policies to ensure that its collection of data is conducted in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations and that the collection is for legitimate purposes as set out in its agreements. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we are in compliance with PRC laws and regulations with respect to data security in all material aspects,
(i) we have implemented comprehensive internal policies and measures on protection of cyber security, data privacy and personal information
as listed above; (ii) there had been no material incident of data or personal information leakage, infringement of data protection and
privacy laws and regulations or investigation or other legal proceeding, pending or threatened against us initiated by competent government
authorities or third parties, that will materially and adversely affect our business; (iii) we have not received any investigation, notice,
warning, penalty or sanction from applicable government authorities (including the CAC) with regard to our business operations concerning
any issues related to cybersecurity and data security; (iv) we have not been involved in any suits, judicial review, enquiry, or other
legal proceedings initiated by applicable governmental authorities in relation to any violation of applicable regulations or policies
that have been issued by the CAC; (v) our PRC subsidiary s business operations do not involve any Critical Information Infrastructure,
and neither we nor the PRC subsidiary has received any notification from applicable PRC governmental authorities indicating that any
of the PRC subsidiary s products or services is determined as the Critical Information Infrastructure. 

Compliance
with these laws, as well as additional regulations and standards regarding data privacy, data collection and information security that
PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, may result in additional expenses to us as we may be required to upgrade our current information
technology systems. Furthermore, as a result of legislative and regulatory rules, we may be required to notify the owners of information
of any breach, theft or loss of their information, which could harm our reputation, as well as subject us to litigation or actions by
regulatory bodies and adversely affect our financial results. 

In
addition, while we take various measures to comply with all applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, there is no
guarantee that our current security measures and those of our third-party service providers may always be adequate for the protection
of our customer, employee or company data; and like all companies, we have experienced data incidents from time to time. In addition,
given the size of our customer base and the types and volume of personal data on our system, we may be a particularly attractive target
for computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists. Unauthorized access to our proprietary internal and customer data may
be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service
attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third-party service providers, or other misconduct.
Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our proprietary internal and customer data
change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. Unauthorized
access to our proprietary internal and customer data may also be obtained through inadequate use of security controls. Any of such incidents
may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to negative publicity
about our security and privacy policies, systems, or measurements from time to time. 

45 

Any
failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches, cyber-attacks or other unauthorized access to our systems or disclosure of our customers 
data, including their personal information, could result in loss or misuse of such data, interruptions to our service system, diminished
customer experience, loss of customer confidence and trust, impairment of our technology infrastructure, and harm our reputation and
business, resulting in significant legal and financial exposure and potential lawsuits and could cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or be worthless. In addition, any violation of the provisions and requirements under relevant laws and regulations
with respect to cyber security, data security and personal information protection may subject us to rectifications, warnings, fines,
confiscation of illegal gains, suspension of the related business, revocation of licenses, cancellation of qualifications being entered
into the relevant credit record or even criminal liabilities. 

If
in the future, the PRC regulators require us or our PRC subsidiary to apply for a cybersecurity review, we cannot assure you that we
are able to pass such review. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance
with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including suspension our business, website closure, removal
of our app from the relevant app stores, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings
or actions against us, which may have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause
the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

As
for the Draft Regulation issued by CAC recently, since the relevant government authorities are still seeking comments on the Draft Regulation
from the public as of the date of this Annual Report, the Draft Regulation (especially its operative provision) and its anticipated adoption
or effective date are subject to further changes with substantial uncertainty. We will continue to pay close attention to the legislative
and regulatory developments in data security and comply with the latest regulatory requirements. 

Uncertainties
exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations with respect to online platform
business operation. 

Our
business is digital marketing consultation, not an online platform. But since our PRC subsidiary assists our customers to applying customers 
apps to other app platform, we may be subject to various internet-related laws and regulations. These internet-related laws and regulations
are relatively new and evolving, and their enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation involve significant uncertainties. 

For
example, On February 7, 2021, the State Administration for Market Regulation, or the SAMR, promulgated Guidelines to Anti-Monopoly in
the Field of Platform Economy, or the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Platform Economy. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Platform Economy
provides operational standards and guidelines for identifying certain internet platforms abuse of market dominant position which
are prohibited to restrict unfair competition and safeguard users interests, including without limitation, prohibiting personalized
pricing using big data and analytics, selling products below cost without reasonable causes, actions or arrangements seen as exclusivity
arrangements, using technology means to block competitors interface, using bundle services to sell services or products. In addition,
internet platforms compulsory collection of user data may be viewed as abuse of dominant market position that may have the effect
to eliminate or restrict competition. As of the date of this Annual Report, neither we nor our PRC subsidiary have been subject to any
anti-monopoly investigation, penalty of litigation initiated by government authorities or third parties. Furthermore, we will continue
to attach attention to the updates of applicable PRC laws and regulations in relation to antimonopoly. 

On
August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress promulgated the E-commerce Law, which came into effect
on January 1, 2019. The E-commerce Law imposes a series of requirements on e-commerce operators including e-commerce platform operators,
merchants operating on the platform and the individuals and entities carrying out business online. The governance measures our PRC subsidiary
adopted in response to the enhanced regulatory requirements may fail to meet these requirements and may lead to penalties or our loss
of merchants to those platforms, or to complaints or claims made against us by customers on our platforms. 

In
addition, we may be subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. For more details, please
see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our PRC subsidiary may be liable for
improper collection, use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers and employees. 

46 

Currently,
these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operation. However, since these statements and regulatory
actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing
or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential
impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments
and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. 

As
there are uncertainties regarding the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the existing and future internet-related
laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our business operations will comply with such regulations in all respects and we may
be ordered to terminate certain of our business operations that are deemed illegal by the regulatory authorities and become subject to
fines and/or other sanctions which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our
PRC subsidiary may be subject to additional contributions of social insurance and housing fund and late payments and fines imposed by
relevant governmental authorities. Non-compliance with labor-related laws and regulations of the PRC may have an adverse impact on our
financial condition and results of operation. 

In
accordance with the PRC Social Insurance Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Fund and other relevant laws and regulations,
China establishes a social insurance system and other employee benefits including basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related
injury insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, housing fund, and a handicapped employment security fund, or collectively
the Employee Benefits. An employer shall pay the Employee Benefits for its employees in accordance with the rates provided under relevant
regulations and shall withhold the social insurance and other Employee Benefits that should be assumed by the employees. For example,
an employer that has not made social insurance contributions at a rate and based on an amount prescribed by the law, or at all, may be
ordered to rectify the non-compliance and pay the required contributions within a stipulated deadline and be subject to a late fee of
up to 0.05 or 0.2 per day, as the case may be. If the employer still fails to rectify the failure to make social insurance contributions
within the stipulated deadline, it may be subject to a fine ranging from one to three times of the amount overdue. 

As
the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our employment
practice does not and will not violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government
investigations. If we are deemed to have violated relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation
to our employees and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our
PRC subsidiary failed to deposit adequate contributions to the housing fund for all of its employees and may be reported by its employees
to the People s court for enforcement. 

Our
PRC subsidiary failed to deposit adequate contributions to the housing funds for all of its employees, but has not received any notice
of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities for non-compliance on
labor-related laws and regulations. As a remediation, our PRC subsidiary started to deposit the adequate contributions to the housing
funds from July 2021 onwards. Before July 2021, our PRC subsidiary failed to deposit adequate contributions of housing provident fund
for all employees in accordance with Article 15 of the regulations on the administration of housing provident fund. As of the date of
this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary did not receive any warning and punishment notice from the authority. As advised by the PRC legal
counsel, according to Article 38 of the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Provident Funds, if an employer fails to make the
housing provident fund contributions on time or at a rate and based on an amount prescribed by the law, or at all, may be ordered by
the housing provident fund management center to rectify the non-compliance and pay the required contributions within a stipulated deadline.
If the employer still fails to rectify the failure to make housing provident fund contributions within the stipulated deadline, the housing
provident fund management center may apply to the people s court for enforcement. The maximum amount that the housing provident
fund management center may apply for enforcement could be the total accumulated amount of the company s unpaid housing fund. 

47 

PRC
laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and any changes in such laws and regulations
may impair our ability to operate profitably. 

There
are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to,
the laws and regulations governing our business and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances.
The laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement
may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness and interpretation of newly enacted laws or regulations, including amendments
to existing laws and regulations, may be delayed, and our business may be affected if we rely on laws and regulations which are subsequently
adopted or interpreted in a manner different from our understanding of these laws and regulations. New laws and regulations that affect
existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing
or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business. 

Because
our business is conducted in RMB and the price of the Company s common stock is quoted in United States dollars, changes in currency
conversion rates may affect the value of the Company. 

Our
business is conducted in the PRC, our books and records are maintained in RMB, which is the lawful currency of the PRC, and the financial
statements that we file with the SEC and provide to our shareholders are presented in United States dollar. Changes in the exchange rate
between the RMB and United States dollar affect the value of our assets and the results of our operations in United States dollar. The
value of the RMB against the United States dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes
in the PRC s political and economic conditions and perceived changes in the economy of the PRC and the United States. Any significant
revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. 

Under
the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, our PRC subsidiary may be classified as a resident enterprise of China,
which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders. 

The
EIT Law and its implementing rules provide that enterprises established outside of China whose de facto management bodies 
are located in China are considered resident enterprises under PRC tax laws. The implementing rules promulgated under the
EIT Law define the term de facto management bodies as a management body which substantially manages, or has control over
the business, personnel, finance and assets of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, issued the
Circular on Issues Concerning the Identification of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Registered Enterprises as Resident Enterprises in Accordance
With the Actual Standards of Organizational Management, known as SAT Circular 82, which has been revised by the Decision of the State
Administration of Taxation on Issuing the Lists of Invalid and Abolished Tax Departmental Rules and Taxation Normative Documents on December
29, 2017 and by the Decision of the State Council on Cancellation and Delegation of a Batch of Administrative Examination and Approval
Items on November 8, 2013. Circular 82 has provided certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management
bodies of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to
offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the
criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT s general position on how the de facto management body text
should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled
offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a de facto management body 
in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met: (i)
the places where senior management and senior management departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management
of the enterprise perform their duties are mainly located within the territory of China; (ii) financial decisions (such as money borrowing,
lending, financing and financial risk management) and personnel decisions (such as appointment, dismissal, salary and wages) are made
or need to be made by organizations or persons located within the territory of China; (iii) main property, accounting books, corporate
seal, the board of directors and files of the minutes of shareholders meetings of the enterprise are located or preserved within
the territory of China; and (iv) one half (or more) of the directors or senior management staff having the right to vote habitually reside
within the territory of China. 

48 

If
our PRC subsidiary is deemed as a PRC resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we will be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax on our worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25 , although dividends distributed to us from our existing PRC subsidiary
and any other PRC subsidiaries which our PRC subsidiary may establish from time to time could be exempt from the PRC dividend withholding
tax due to our PRC resident recipient status. This could have a material and adverse effect on our overall effective tax
rate, our income tax expenses and our net income. Furthermore, dividends, if any, paid to our shareholders may be decreased as a result
of the decrease in distributable profits. In addition, if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise , any dividends our
PRC subsidiary pays to our non-PRC investors, and the gains realized from the transfer of the Company s common stock may be considered
income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10 in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20 in the
case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty). It is unclear whether holders of
the Company s common stock would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the
PRC in the event that our PRC subsidiary is treated as a PRC resident enterprise. This could have a material and adverse effect on the
value of the price of the Company s common stock. 

There
are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable
by our PRC subsidiary to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain t reaty benefits. 

Under
the EIT Law and its implementation rules, the profits of a foreign invested enterprise generated through operations, which are distributed
to its immediate holding company outside the PRC, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10 . Pursuant to the Arrangement
between the Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income ,
or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, a withholding tax rate of 10 may be lowered to 5 if the PRC enterprise is at least 25 held
by a Hong Kong enterprise for at least 12 consecutive months prior to distribution of the dividends and is determined by the relevant
PRC tax authority to have satisfied other conditions and requirements under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable
PRC laws. 

However,
based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties , or the SAT
Circular 81, which became effective on February 20, 2009, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a
company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities
may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to Circular on Several Issues regarding the Beneficial Owner 
in Tax Treaties , which became effective as of April 1, 2018, when determining an applicant s status as the beneficial
owner regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests, or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors will
be taken into account. Such factors include whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes actual business activities, and
whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax, grant tax exemption on relevant incomes, or levy
tax at an extremely low rate. This circular further requires any applicant who intends to be proved of being the beneficial owner 
to file relevant documents with the relevant tax authorities. Our PRC subsidiary is wholly owned by our Hong Kong subsidiary. However,
we cannot assure you that our determination regarding our qualification to enjoy the preferential tax treatment will not be challenged
by the relevant PRC tax authority or we will be able to complete the necessary filings with the relevant PRC tax authority and enjoy
the preferential withholding tax rate of 5 under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by our PRC
subsidiary to our HK subsidiary, in which case, we would be subject to the higher withdrawing tax rate of 10 on dividends received. 

PRC
regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion
may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary, which could materially and adversely
affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

We
are an offshore holding company conducting our operations in China through our PRC subsidiary. We may make loans to our PRC subsidiary,
or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary. Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity,
make to our PRC subsidiary, are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans to our PRC subsidiary cannot exceed statutory limits and
are subject to foreign exchange loan registrations. Our capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary must be registered with the MOFCOM
or its local counterpart. 

49 

In
light of the various requirements imposed by of PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding
companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government
approvals or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiary or with respect to future
capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals on a timely basis
or at all, our ability to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely
affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

Government
control in currency conversion may adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to remit dividends, and the value of your investment. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of
currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our holding companies
may rely on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. 

Under
existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, Renminbi cannot be freely converted into any foreign currency, and conversion and remittance
of foreign currencies are subject to PRC foreign exchange regulations. It cannot be guaranteed that under a certain exchange rate, we
will have sufficient foreign exchange to meet our foreign exchange requirements. Under the current PRC foreign exchange control system,
foreign exchange transactions under the current account conducted by us, including the payment of dividends, do not require advance approval
from SAFE, but we are required to present documentary evidence of such transactions and conduct such transactions at designated foreign
exchange banks within China that have the licenses to carry out foreign exchange business. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital
account conducted by us, however, must be approved in advance by SAFE. 

Under
existing foreign exchange regulations, we will be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying
with certain procedural requirements. However, we cannot assure you that these foreign exchange policies regarding payment of dividends
in foreign currencies will continue in the future. 

In
fact, in light of the flood of capital outflows of China in 2016 due to the weakening Renminbi, the PRC government has imposed more restrictive
foreign exchange policies and stepped up scrutiny of major outbound capital movement including overseas direct investment. More restrictions
and substantial vetting process are put in place by SAFE to regulate cross-border transactions falling under the capital account. If
any of our shareholders regulated by such policies fails to satisfy the applicable overseas direct investment filing or approval requirement
timely or at all, it may be subject to penalties from the relevant PRC authorities. The PRC government may at its discretion further
restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents
us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the Company s common stock. Our capital expenditure plans and our business,
operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

If
we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to
expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation. 

U.S.
public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial
accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result
of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased
in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC
enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide
scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable
allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such
allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our
business. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected. 

50 

The
disclosures in the Company s reports and other filings with the SEC and the Company s other public pronouncements are not
subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. 

The
Company is regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Company s SEC reports and other disclosures
and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in the
Company s SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator
that is responsible for oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, reader should review the Company s SEC reports,
filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any review of the Company, its SEC
reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements. 

Risks
relating to PRC laws and regulations with respect to foreign exchange 

The
Regulation on Foreign Exchange Administration of the People s Republic of China (the Regulation on Foreign Exchange Administration was promulgated by the State Council of the PRC and came into effect on August 5, 2008. According to Regulation on Foreign Exchange Administration,
a PRC individual that makes direct investment or trades negotiable securities or derivative products overseas shall handle the registration
formalities at the foreign exchange administrative department of the State Council. If the relevant provisions require such individual
to obtain a pre-approval from or complete a filing with the competent department, he or she shall do so before handling the registration
formalities. Where any evasion of foreign exchange control is committed, such as transferring foreign exchange within the territory of
the PRC to the overseas in violation of PRC laws and regulations or transferring capital within the territory of the PRC to the overseas
by fraudulent means, competent foreign exchange administrative authority shall order the return of the foreign exchange within a prescribed
time limit, and impose a fine of no more than 30 of the amount of foreign exchange evading government control; or if the circumstances
are serious, impose a fine of no more than 100 but no less than 30 of the amount of foreign exchange evading government control; and
if the activity constitutes a crime, the violator shall be subject to criminal liabilities according to relevant laws and regulations.
In addition, where any individual, in violation of the foreign exchange provisions, changes the designated use of foreign exchange, the
foreign exchange administrative authority shall order such individual to correct such illegal act, confiscate the illegal proceeds and
impose a fine of no more than 30 of the amount of violation; or if the circumstances are serious, it may impose a fine of no more than
100 but no less than 30 of the amount of violation. 

In
July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing
and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning
Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles,
or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment
or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of holding
domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident s registration in the event
of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by
PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents 
failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities
of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions
on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute additional capital
to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties under PRC law for
evasion of foreign exchange regulations. 

Guolin
Tao and Ying Sun, each, a Beneficial Owner, and together, the Beneficial Owners , who are our major beneficial
owners and are PRC individuals and PRC residents, have not completed the relevant foreign exchange registrations as required by PRC laws
and regulations. We have also requested our shareholders who are PRC individuals or PRC residents to make the necessary applications,
filings, and amendments as required under PRC laws and regulations. However, there is uncertainty concerning under what circumstances
residents of other countries and regions can be classified as a PRC resident. The PRC government authorities may interpret our beneficial
owners status differently or their status may change in the future. Moreover, we may not be fully informed of the identities of
our beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that all of our PRC individual or PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with PRC
laws and regulations with respect to foreign exchange. 

51 

Although
the current PRC laws and regulations mainly provide for corresponding penalties for PRC individual who is actually in violation of the
PRC laws and regulations, we cannot exclude the possibility that any failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC individuals or PRC
residents to make any required registrations may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, and prevent us from being able to make distributions
or pay dividends, as a result of which our business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially adversely
affected. 

Increases
in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability. 

China s
economy has experienced increases in labor costs in recent years, which is expected to continue to grow. The average wage level for our
employees will also need to be increased in order to keep them. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits,
will continue to increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our customers by increasing prices for our products
or services, our profitability and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

In
addition, our PRC subsidiary has been subject to stricter regulatory requirements in terms of entering into labor contracts with our
employees and paying various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance,
unemployment insurance and childbearing insurance to designated government agencies for the benefits of our employees. Pursuant to the
PRC Labor Contract Law, or the Labor Contract Law, that became effective in January 2008 and its implementing rules that became effective
in September 2008 and its amendments that became effective in July 2013, employers are subject to stricter requirements in terms of signing
labor contracts, minimum wages, paying remuneration, determining the term of employees probation and unilaterally terminating
labor contracts. In the event that our PRC subsidiary decides to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or
labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may limit our ability to effect those changes in a desirable or
cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

As
the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure that our employment
practice does not and will not violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government
investigations. If our PRC subsidiary is deemed to have violated relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide
additional compensation to our employees and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. 

We
may be involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

From
time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings and commercial disputes. Such proceedings or disputes are typically claims that
arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, and other disputes with
customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, tax matters and employment matters. There can be no assurance that such proceedings
and claims, should they arise, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The
directors and executive officers of the subsidiaries, as well as our employees who execute other strategic initiatives may have potential
conflicts of interests with the Company. 

If
any of the directors and executive officers of the Company s subsidiaries, as well as our employees who execute other strategic
initiatives, have a conflict of interests with the Company, they may bring an opportunity elsewhere. Thereby, we would lose out on the
business. 

52 

Under
PRC law, legal documents for corporate transactions, including agreements and contracts are executed using the chop or seal of the signing
entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with relevant PRC industry and commerce
authorities. 

To
ensure the use of our seals and seals, our PRC subsidiary has established internal control procedures and rules for the use of these
seals and seals. If a seal and seal are to be used, the responsible person will submit an application through our office automation system,
and the application will be verified and approved by an authorized employee in accordance with our internal control procedures and rules.
In addition, in order to maintain the physical security of the seals, we usually store them in a secure location that only authorized
employees can access. Although we monitor these authorized employees, these procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all abuse or
negligence. Our employees are at risk of abuse of authority. For example, any employee who acquires, abuses or misappropriates our seals
and seals or other controlling intangible assets for any reason, we may suffer from disruption of normal business operations, and we
may have to take a company or legal action, this can cost a lot of time and money. 

Future
inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China. 

In
recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past
ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been significant. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from
time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation.
High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which
could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company. 

Claims
against the Company or its management may be hard to initiate and to enforce. Even if successful, claims against the Company or its management
may be nearly impossible to collect upon. 

While
the Company s service of process provider, National Registered Agent, Inc., is located at 701 Carson Street, Suite 200, Carson
City, NV 89701, USA, there is no guarantee that service of process can be successfully completed against the Company s operating
subsidiaries or its management, as they are based in China. Even with successful service of process to National Registered Agent, you
may be unable to enforce a court judgment against the Company s operating subsidiaries or its management, as they have no property
in the United States, to which such judgment could be attached. 

You
may face difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our
management named in this registration statement based on foreign laws. 

We,
through our PRC subsidiary, conduct our business in China, and our assets are located in China. In addition, all of our senior executive
officers are PRC nationals and they have lived in China for a significant portion of time. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible
for you to bring an action against us or against our management named in this registration statement in the United States in the event
that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise as it may be difficult for
our shareholders to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside China. Furthermore, China does not have treaties providing
for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with many other countries and regions. Therefore, recognition and
enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to
a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the
laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. 

Furthermore,
as a matter of law or practicality, it is generally difficult to pursue shareholder claims including securities law class actions and
fraud claims in China, which are contrarily common in the United States. For example, you may experience significant legal and practical
obstacles to obtaining necessary information for shareholder investigations or litigations outside China or with respect to foreign
entities. Although the local authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities
of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, so far no such cooperation has been established
with the United States securities regulatory authorities. In addition, Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law which became effective in
March 2020 promulgated that no overseas securities regulator is allowed to conduct investigation or evidence collection activities directly
in the PRC. Therefore, without approval from the competent PRC securities regulators and relevant authorities, no organization or individual
may provide documents and materials relating to the securities activities to overseas entities. While detailed interpretation of or implementation
rules under Article 177 has yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation
or evidence collection activities within China may further increase the difficulties you face in protecting your interests. 

53 

Restrictions
on currency exchange under PRC laws may limit our ability to convert cash derived from our operating activities into foreign currencies
and may materially and adversely affect the value of the Company s common stock. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency
out of China. We, through our PRC subsidiary, receive our revenue in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our income is primarily
derived from dividend payments from Entrepreneurship World Consultants, the EWC WFOE. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency
may restrict the ability of EWC WFOE to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy
their foreign currency denominated obligations, if any. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, conversion of Renminbi is permitted,
without prior approval from the SAFE, for current account transactions, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures
from trade-related transactions, as long as certain procedural requirements are complied with. However, any existing and future restrictions
on currency exchange in China may limit our ability to convert cash derived from our operating activities into foreign currencies to
fund expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. If the foreign exchange restrictions in China prevent us from obtaining U.S. dollars
or other foreign currencies as required, our PRC subsidiary may not be able to pay dividends in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies
to our Shareholders. 

Risks
Related to the Market for the Company s Common Stock 

Our
CEO owns a significant percentage of the Company s common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject
to shareholder approval. 

Our
CEO and majority shareholder, Mr. Guolin Tao, has beneficial ownership of 1,030,916,276 shares of common stock of the Company. These
shares represent ownership of approximately 60.60 of the Company s common stock as of March 9, 2023. Mr. Guolin Tao may be able
to determine all matters requiring shareholder approval. For example, Mr. Guolin Tao may be able to control elections of directors, amendments
of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or
discourage unsolicited transaction proposals or offers for the Company s common stock that you may believe are in your best interest
as one of our shareholders. 

Since
the Company s common stock is traded on the OTC Pink Sheets, an active, liquid trading market for the Company s common stock
may not develop or be sustained. If and when an active market develops the price of the Company s common stock may be volatile. 

Presently,
the Company s common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter OTC Pink Sheets. Presently there is limited trading
in the Company s stock and in the absence of an active trading market investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining
market quotations, market visibility for shares of the Company s common stock may be limited, and a lack of visibility for shares
of the Company s common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of its common stock. 

54 

The
lack of an active market impairs your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable.
The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to
raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares. 

Trading
in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that
may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. The securities market has from time to time experienced significant
price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may
also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of the Company s common stock. Moreover, the OTC Pink Sheets is
not a stock exchange, and trading of securities is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like
Nasdaq or a national stock exchange like the NYSE. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any shares of common stock. 

The
Company s Board of Directors may authorize and issue shares of new classes of stock that could be superior to or adversely affect
you as a holder of the Company s common stock 

The
Company s board of directors has the power to authorize and issue shares of classes of stock, including preferred stock that have
voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations and special rights, including preferred distribution rights, conversion rights,
redemption rights and liquidation rights without further shareholder approval which could adversely affect the rights of the holders
of the Company s common stock. In addition, the Company s board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock
that has greater voting power than the Company s common stock or that is convertible into the Company s common stock, which
could decrease the relative voting power of the Company s common stock or result in dilution to the Company s existing common
stockholders. 

Any
of these actions could significantly adversely affect the investment made by holders of the Company s common stock. Holders of
common stock could potentially not receive dividends that they might otherwise have received. In addition, holders of the Company s
common stock could receive less proceeds in connection with any future sale of the Company, whether in liquidation or on any other basis. 

There
is a limited public market for the Company s common stock. 

There
is currently a limited public market for the common stock. Holders of the Company s common stock may, therefore, have difficulty
selling their common stock, should they decide to do so. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that
any shares of common stock will be able to be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price of the common stock may not necessarily
bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value,
and may not be indicative of the market price for the common stock in the future. Further, the market price for the common stock may
be volatile depending on a number of factors, including business performance, industry dynamics, news announcements or changes in general. 

We
may, in the future, issue additional common shares, which would reduce investors percent of ownership and may dilute the
Company s share value. 

The
Company s Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 1,800,000,000 shares of common stock. As of March 9, 2023, we have
1,701,181,423 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The future issuance of common stock will result in substantial dilution
in the percentage of the Company s common stock held by the Company s then existing shareholders. We may value any common
stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate
actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by the Company s investors and might have an adverse effect
on any trading market for the Company s common stock. 

55 

There
is a limited market for the Company s common stock, which may make it difficult for holders of the Company s common stock
to sell their stock. 

The
Company s common stock currently trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol EUBG and currently there is minimal
trading in the Company s common stock. There can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for the Company s
common stock, the ability of holders of the Company s common stock to sell the Company s common stock, or the prices at which
holders may be able to sell the Company s common stock. Further, many brokerage firms will not process transactions involving low
price stocks, especially those that come within the definition of a penny stock. If we cease to be quoted, holders of the
Company s common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the
Company s common stock, and the market value of the Company s common stock would likely decline. 

The
trading price of the Company s common stock is likely to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. 

The
trading price of the Company s common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control.
This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other
companies with business operations located outside of the United States. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading
volume for the Company s common stock may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, including the following: 

variations in our revenues,
 earnings and cash flow; 

announcements of new investments,
 acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors; 

announcements of new offerings,
 solutions and expansions by us or our competitors; 

changes in financial estimates
 by securities analysts; 

detrimental adverse publicity
 about us, our brand, our services or our industry; 

additions or departures
 of key personnel; 

sales of additional equity
 securities; and 

potential litigation or
 regulatory investigations. 

Any
of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which the Company s common stock will trade. 

In
the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods
of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount
of our management s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses
to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our
reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be
required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Lack
of market and state blue sky laws may make shares of the Company s common stock more difficult to sell. 

Investors
may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws. The holders of the Company s shares
of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there
may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell the Company s shares. Accordingly, even if we
are successful in having the shares available for trading on the OTC, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company s
securities to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding our Company in an accepted publication
which permits a manual exemption. This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without
being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state.
However, it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers,
officers, and directors, (2) an issuer s balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding
the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information.
Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non-issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers
selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor s, Moody s Investor
Service, Fitch s Investment Service, and Best s Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller
number of states declare that they recognize securities manuals but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following
states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wisconsin. 

56 

Accordingly,
the Company s shares of Common Stock should be considered totally illiquid, which inhibits investors ability to resell their
shares. 

We
are subject to the penny stock rules, which will make shares of the Company s common stock more difficult to sell. 

We
will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of the Company s common
stock. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has
a market price less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. We anticipate
that the Company s common stock will become a penny stock , and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange
Act, or the Penny Stock Rule . This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such
securities to persons other than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability
determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result,
this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company s securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to
sell any of the Company s securities in the secondary market. 

For
any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure
schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are
required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stock. 

We
do not anticipate that the Company s common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if the
Company s common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act,
which gives the Commission the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the Commission
finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest. 

Shares
of the Company s common stock that have not been registered under federal securities laws are subject to resale restrictions imposed
by Rule 144, including those set forth in Rule 144(i) which apply to a former shell company. 

We
were deemed a shell company under applicable SEC rules and regulations because we had no or nominal operations and either
no or nominal assets, assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents
and nominal other assets. Pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, sales of the securities of a former shell company,
such as us, under that rule are not permitted unless at the time of a proposed sale, we have filed Form 10 information with the SEC,
we are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have filed all reports and other materials
required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months, other than Form 8-K reports.
Additionally, our previous status as a shell company could also limit our use of our securities to pay for any acquisitions we may seek
to pursue in the future. The lack of liquidity of the Company s securities as a result of the inability to sell under Rule 144
for a longer period of time than a non-former shell company could cause the market price of the Company s securities to decline.
There can be no assurance that we will ever meet these conditions and any purchases of the Company s shares are subject to these
restrictions on resale. 

57 

We
currently do not have an audit or compensation committee 

Because
we do not have an audit or compensation committee, stockholders will have to rely on the Company s entire Board of Directors, none
of which are independent, to perform these functions. Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent
directors, these functions are performed by the Company s Board of Directors as a whole. Thus, there is a potential conflict in
that Board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues
that may affect management decisions. 

We
are subject to compliance with Security laws exposure 

We
are subject to compliance with securities laws, which exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights. We
may offer to sell the Company s shares of the Company s common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, as well as those of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions
is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors
and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under
any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information
provided by investor themselves. 

If
any such offering did not qualify for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it
so desired. It is possible that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under
state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration
or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful
in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which we have relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
imposed by the Commission and state securities agencies. 

There
is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends to the Company s shareholders, which means that you could receive little
or no return on your investment. 

Because
we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on shares of the Company s common stock, the Company s stockholders will not be
able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and
expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of the Company s common stock in the foreseeable
future. Unless we pay dividends, the Company s stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell
them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares of the Company s common stock when desired. 

Compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of
completing an acquisition. 

Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require us to have
such system audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls,
we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or shareholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable
financial reports could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered
in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results
or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our
reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company s securities. 

58 

We
are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies will make the Company s securities less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will
remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. However, if the Company s non-convertible debt issued within
a three-year period exceeds 1.0 billion or revenues exceed 1.07 billion, or the market value of the Company s common stock that
are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease
to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not being required to comply
with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in the Company s periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are exempt from the requirements of holding
a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find the Company s
shares less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find the Company s shares less attractive as
a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company s shares and the Company s share price may be more volatile. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such
extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or
private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will not adopt the new or revised standard until the time private companies are
required to adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

Impact
of COVID-19 

In
early January of 2020, a novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak took place in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, it has spread
rapidly to Asia and other parts of the world. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread economic disruptions in China, as well
as stringent government measures by the Chinese government to contain its transmissions including quarantines, travel restrictions, and
temporary closures of non-essential businesses in China and elsewhere. 

At
the end of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to be generally under control and business activities have recovered on the whole.
The outbreak became more stabilized in China and other regions in the world. However, sporadic cases continue to be found during the
first half year of 2021 in China. In the second quarter of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 had been found in certain cities in
China, which cause another outbreak, thus increasing risks and possible further disruption to businesses. Therefore, certain of our consulting
services were suspended from April 2021 to August 2021. We have resumed these consulting businesses from August 2021 in order to maintain
diversified services for our customers. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although vaccines
are now being distributed and administered across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue to
emerge that have shown to be more contagious. We continue to adhere to applicable governmental and commercial restrictions and to work
to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, customers, communities, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which the
COVID-19 outbreak may impact the company s business, operations and financial results from this point forward will depend on numerous
evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following: the duration and scope of the pandemic;
governmental, business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic in the future; and any other further development of
the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Substantially
all of our revenues and operations are concentrated in China. Consequently, our results of operations and financial performances have
been affected since 2020 and into 2022. Due to the government measures taken to contain COVID-19, the offline activities of our PRC subsidiary
were restricted from late January to May 2020, resulting in cancellations or postponements of the marketing efforts of our customers.
In addition, due to widespread economic disruptions during the outbreak, demand for our consulting services by small and medium-sized
enterprises were also adversely affected. Specifically, as a result of government mandated closures of non-essential business in China,
many of our customers business were suspended while others permanently closed their businesses, which has had an adverse impact
on our business and financial condition and has hampered our ability to generate revenue and access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable
terms. 

We
achieved an operating revenue of 3,507,590 and 5,637,396 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing
a decrease of approximately 37.8 from the prior year. COVID-19 has and may continue to adversely affect our financial and business performance. 

Overview 

Prior
to the Transaction on May 15, 2019, we were inactive from 2007 to 2019, and did not have any active business activities. In May of 2019,
the new major shareholders rejuvenated marketing consultancy services and e-commerce business in China to the Company and its subsidiaries.
EUBG is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. Our PRC subsidiary s operations in China are the primary operations of
the Company. While substantially all of our operations are located in China, we currently do not, and we do not plan to use variable
interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. However, because our operations are in China
and our major shareholders are located in China, there is always a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to affect
operations of any company with any level of operations in China, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities
on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. If any or all of the foregoing were to occur,
it could, in turn, result in a material change in the Company s operations and/or the value of its common stock and/or significantly
limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to
significantly decline or be worthless. 

61 

On
March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that Beijing Jade Bird Culture and Art Research Institute Jade Bird ), the KOL
agency that the PRC subsidiary works with to coordinate digital training related service, suspended its service after receiving a notice
from China National Personal Talent Training Network CNPTTN ), a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training, that until
further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services using CNPTTN s name from January 30, 2022. As a result of CNPTTN s
suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related services with Jade Bird until further notice. Jade Bird
is an authorized licensee of CNPTTN. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the digital training related services with Jade
Bird represented 7.5 and 20.9 of our total revenue, or 262,799 and 1,176,515, respectively.

Revenue
and cost of revenue 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of 3,507,590 compared to 5,637,396 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing
a decrease of 2,129,806 or 37.8 as compared with the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to our consultancy services income, generated
from clients who engaged in online courses business, dropped by 2,701,529 as compared with last year. This was because the end customers
became more patience and cautious in choosing online courses. Besides, we suspended the digital training services with Jade Bird since
March 22, 2022, resulted a drop of revenue by 913,716 or 77.7 in 2022. We continued to seek different business opportunities to stabilize
our income streams. In 2022, we started a new income stream, provides consultancy services to a customer who engaged in live streaming
business, which contributed revenue of 1,252,854 during the year ended December 31, 2022. However, this new income stream only compensated
a part of the revenue reduction in current year. 

Cost
of revenue was 663,486 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1,827,082 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing
a decrease of 1,163,596 or 63.7 as compared with last year. The decrease of cost of revenue is mainly due to 1) direct operation costs
of the digital training related services dropped by 755,638 or 79 as compared with the prior year, which was generally aligned with
the drop of digital training related services of 77.7 ; 2) direct staff cost dropped by 407, 958 or 46.6 as compared with the prior
year because certain senior staff were reassigned to focus on business management. 

As
a result of the above, the gross profit was 2,844,104 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3,810,314 for the year ended
December 31, 2021, representing a decreased of 966,210 or 25.4 as compared with the prior year. 

62 

Selling
expenses 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 40,165 selling expenses compared to 253,958 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing
a decrease of 213,793 or 84.2 as compared with the prior year. The decrease of selling expenses was mainly due to the tightening of
entertainment policies during the year and the staff costs incurred in selling activities were dropped by 134,696 or 88.9 for the year
ended December 31, 2022. 

General
and administrative expenses 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 1,683,575 general and administrative expenses compared to 1,668,432 for the year ended
December 31, 2021, representing a slight increase of 15,143 or 0.9 as compared with the prior year. Our general and administrative
expenses consisted mainly of audit fees, professional fees, payroll expenses and consultancy fees. 

Total
other (expense) income, net 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred net other expenses of 14,311 compared to net other income 187,392 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The difference of 201,703 was mainly due to exchange loss of 175,810 resulting from the exchange rate appreciation
of HKD against RMB for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our net other (expenses) income mainly consisted of bank interest income, exchange
rate differences and certain sundry incomes. 

Income
tax expense 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred income tax expense of 701,435 compared to 988,916 for the year ended December 31, 2021,
representing a decrease of 287,481 or 29.1 as compared with the prior year. The income tax expenses were charged in China and Hong
Kong. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, our income tax expenses comprised of current tax expenses and deferred tax expenses of 540,840 and
 160,595, respectively, compared to current tax expenses and deferred tax expenses of 767,877 and 221,039 for the year ended December

Cash
(used in) generated from operating activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 138,894, as compared to net cash generated from operating
activities of 451,663 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a difference of 590,557 or 130.8 as compared with the prior
year. The decrease of operating cash flows was mainly resulted from a combination of below operating activities changes: 

Net
income was 404,618 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 1,086,400 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease
of net income of 681,782 or 62.8 was mainly due to the reduction of certain performance-based arrangement consultancy services during
the year which directly reduced our operating cash inflow. 

Deferred
tax adjustment was 152,190 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 293,366 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The difference
was mainly due to our PRC subsidiary generated net profits of 1,670,194 and 1,931,000 respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2022 and 2021; while the PRC subsidiary only distributed dividends of 3,120,921 to our Hong Kong subsidiary in current year, representing
a decrease of 1,475,615 as compared with prior year. 

Cash
outflow of trade receivables was 176,709 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash inflow of 137,165 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The cash outflow of 176,709 for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to longer settlement period used by our
consultancy services customers. 

Cash
outflow of trade payables was 109,414 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to cash inflow of 115,561 for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The cash inflow of 115,561 from trade payable for the year ended December 31, 2021 was resulted from the digital
training related services. However, as the digital training related services with Jade Bird was suspended since March 2022 and all the
account payables were settled during the year ended December 31, 2022, cash outflow of 109,414 was resulted for the year. 

Cash
outflow of other payables and accrued liabilities was 19,555 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash outflow of 220,493
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were due to the settlement of the
accrued audit fee, consultancy fee and professional fee during the years. Larger cash outflow was resulted in the year ended December
31, 2021 because the Company filed a registration document during the year and settled the service fees with the professional parties. 

Cash
inflow of tax payables was 59,976 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to cash outflow of 563,979 for the year ended December
31, 2021. The cash inflow of 59,976 for the year ended December 31, 2022 was mainly due to the business reduction during the year and
we provided current income tax of 540,840, netting off with 497,678 income tax paid during the year. The cash outflow of 563,979 for
the year ended December 31, 2021 was mainly due to the current income tax provision of 767,877, netting off with 1,326,242 income tax
paid during the prior year. 

Cash outflow of contract liabilities was 204,164
for the year ended December 31, 2022 because the outstanding contract liabilities as at December 31, 2021 were all recognized as revenue
during the year ended December 31, 2022. No contract liabilities was recorded as at December 31, 2022. 

64 

As
we are continually to explore new business opportunities and new customers, we expect to generate more cash inflows in the coming years.
We continue to monitor our level of operating expenses in order to maintain a positive cash flow position. 

Cash
(used in) generated from investing activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 9,704 as compared net cash of 3,289,189 generated from investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due
to purchase of property, plant and equipment. On September 29, 2022, the Company provided loans of 1,040,307 to two independent vendors
of the Company s consultancy business. As the loans were fully repaid on October 18, 2022, the net cash (used in) generated from
investing activities was not impacted. 

The
net cash generated from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was mainly due to the redemption of debt products of
 5,889,695 offset by the acquisition of debt products of 2,789,855. 

Cash
used in financing activities 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3,492, as compared to net cash of 7,566 used in financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was mainly
due to the repayment of borrowings of 128,656 offsetting against advance from a director of 121,090. 

Future
Capital Requirements 

We
believe that our ability to generate cash from operations are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other cash needs
for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to generate adequate cash from operations in the future, however, will depend on, among
other things, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies while continuing to tightly control our expenses, and to
manage the impact of changes to the PRC regulatory environment. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement
those strategies and cost control initiatives, or successfully adjust to any changes to PRC laws and regulations impacting our business.
In addition, changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, interest rate increases, acquisitions
or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. We can give no assurance that financing will
be available on acceptable terms or at all. Additional equity financing could be dilutive to holders of the Company s common stock;
debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;
 and 

provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
 effect on the financial statements. 

66 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has
concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

1. 
 We did not maintain appropriate
 cash controls We had not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including
 failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on our bank accounts. However, the
 effects of poor cash controls were mitigated in part by the fact that we had introduced certain cash management policies. 

2. 
 We did not implement appropriate
 information technology controls We were retaining copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is
 no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of our data or off-site storage of the data in the event of theft, misplacement,
 or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

3 
 We currently lack sufficient
 accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

4 
 We do not have adequate
 written policies and procedures Due to lack of adequate written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting,
 we did not establish a formal process to close our books monthly and account for all transactions in a timely manner. 

Due
to our small size and the early stage of our business, segregation of duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.
We have limited capital resources and have given priority in the use of those resources to our business development efforts. As a result,
we have not been able to take steps to improve our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2021.
However, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Once our operations grow
and become more complex, our Board of Directors will take steps to remediate these material weaknesses as soon as practicable: 

1. 
 We plan to formalize and
 provide training, on certain policies, including cash control. 

2. 
 We plan, as funding permits,
 to engage a third party consultant to help evaluate and improve the design of appropriate information technology controls. 

3. 
 We plan, as funding permits,
 to appoint additional personnel with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to assist with the preparation of our financial reporting. 

4. 
 Prepare written policies
 and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis
 and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions, in a timely manner. 

67 

Despite
the material weaknesses and deficiencies reported above, our management believes that our financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm
regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as such report is not required due to the
Company s status as a smaller reporting company. 

Change
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
 consolidated balance sheet of Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group (the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related
 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year
 ended December 31, 2022, and related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
 statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results
 of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
 in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements
 are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial
 statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
 States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits
 in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required
 to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are
 required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
 on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing
 procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
 procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
 in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
 management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
 basis for our opinion.
