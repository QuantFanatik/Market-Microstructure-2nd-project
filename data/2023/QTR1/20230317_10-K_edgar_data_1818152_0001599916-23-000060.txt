Corporate
History 

OFF
Line International, Inc., a Delaware corporation the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware

On
November 22, 2019, Koichi Ishizuka paid for expenses relating to the incorporation of the Company with personal funds on behalf of the
Company, in exchange for 20,000,000 shares of restricted Common Stock. Currently, this constitutes 100 of the issued and outstanding
common shares of the Company. 

On
December 30, 2019, the Company entered into and consummated a Share Contribution Agreement (the Share Contribution Agreement with Koichi Ishizuka. Pursuant to this agreement Mr. Ishizuka gifted to the Company, at no cost, 100 shares of common stock of OFF Line
Japan Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation OFF Line Japan ), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares. Following
the execution of this agreement OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd. became our wholly owned subsidiary. 

On
January 15, 2021, Koichi Ishizuka, our sole officer and director, entered into Stock Purchase Agreements with 64 Japanese shareholders.
Pursuant to these agreements, Koichi Ishizuka sold a total of 1,933,000 shares of our common stock to these individuals and received
 193,300 as aggregate consideration. Each shareholder paid 0.10 USD per share. 

The
aforementioned sale of free trading shares was conducted pursuant to the Company s effective S-1 Registration Statement deemed
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 29, 2020 at 4pm EST. As such, the shares sold were deemed freely transferable. 

OFF
Line Japan was incorporated under the laws of Japan on June 13, 2018. Currently, OFF Line Japan is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The
Company is a start-up stage company with a focus on providing telecommunication services and products. 

On
June 16, 2021, the Company s Board of Directors approved to change the name of the Company from OFF Line International,
Inc. to Zentrum Holdings, Inc. On June 16, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary
of State to change our name to Zentrum Holdings, Inc. 

 At
this time, we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary, OFF Line Japan and share the same business plan as that of our
wholly owned subsidiary. 

Overview 

Our
principal executive offices are located at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan. 

The
Company has elected December 31th as its fiscal year end. 

Currently,
we operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, OFF Line Japan, OFF Line Japan which provides telecommunication services
and products. 

OFF
Line Japan was incorporated under the laws of Japan on June 13, 2018. 

Currently,
OFF Line Japan is headquartered at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan. OFF Line Japan s office space is provided
rent free by our Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka. 

OFF
Line Japan s business operations are primarily focused on providing telecommunication services and products. 

Background
of Operations 

Currently,
we operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd., OFF Line Japan , which is engaged in providing
telecommunication products and services in Japan, particularly, the following: 

-
SNS system called AirTalk 

 -
AI Camera Service 

 -
Beacon Business 

 -
Kidnapping Prevention Device named KID 

 -
Drone Management System Development 

 AirTalk 

 AirTalk
is a social networking service (mobile application) with anonymous online/offline chat, having an Instagram-like functionality allowing
users to post photos on maps, and the ability to post short messages as on Twitter. The most current version was released in December
2020. Although it was, at one point, our intention to further develop AirTalk, as of the current date we have not made any additional
developmental efforts. AirTalk was originally developed and released by OFF Line Co., Ltd., and the networking service has more than
20,000 users. 

On
December 1, 2019 OFF Line Co., Ltd. gifted the source code and rights to the program AirTalk to our wholly owned subsidiary,
OFF Line Japan. OFF Line Co., Ltd. is controlled by our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

 After
taking possession of the source code and rights to the program AirTalk we subsequently began to fix numerous bugs that
we had discovered throughout the program. 

AirTalk s
unique feature is its offline chat function, which allows users to chat with each other even when they are unable to use the internet,
using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi at a radius of 120 meters. Once users exceed a radius of 120 meters, offline chat will automatically
switch over to online (internet-based) chat. 

 Another
feature of AirTalk is its GPS Crossed Paths functionality. Users will set their Crossed Paths distance to any distance between 100 m
and 2 km of their device. When another user enters this range (ex: 100 m), the user will receive a notification to their AirTalk app
that they have crossed paths with that other user. As of today, this feature only works when the user is online, but during the process
of ongoing development we intend to convert this feature to Bluetooth. 

 Features 

 -
Communicate without an active internet or data connection great for people on limited data plans, when traveling, or if there s
no internet connectivity in the area. 

 -
Integrated profile builder. 

 -
Send and receive messages with anybody using AirTalk in a 100 m radius. 

 -
TWe will be able to share AirTalk user messages simultaneously via the local map and Twitter. 

Current
status 

 The
most current version of AirTalk was released in December 2020; however, due to COVID-19, we indefinitely suspended our marketing activities
and we have, thus far, made no marketing efforts whatsoever. 

 On
January 1, 2020, OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd entered into an agreement with Ueda Tsusho Ltd to administer AirTalk , and to provide
further development and maintenance of AirTalk and the Company s other various software and hardware it may have,
such as the Company s AI system, all to be further developed on an ongoing need be basis. OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd shall compensate
Ueda Tsusho Ltd in the amount of JPY 40,000 (approximately 380) per day; in this case a day will be defined as a calendar
day during which services have been rendered. The total amount of days will be totaled and accordingly invoiced by Ueda Tsusho Ltd. to
the Company at the end of the month, and the Company will be responsible for remitting full payment the following month. Any additional
services not covered by the agreement shall receive compensation determined on a case by case basis. The term of the agreement shall
be from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, with automatic (unless terminated) extension for additional year long periods. On January
1, 2023 the agreement was automatically renewed for another twelve month period. At present, any and all efforts by Ueno Tsusho Ltd to
further develop AirTalk are indefinitely paused, and Ueno Tsusho Ltd. s sole responsibility is to provide ongoing maintenance. 

 We
have not yet determined a definitive plan as to how we will monetize AirTalk but we have tentative plans to monetize the mobile application
in the future by adding in app advertisements from third parties that we would be compensated for by pay per click, 
or for each placement of each advertisement. At this time, we cannot state with any level of specificity when we will solidify any monetization
plans until the user base of AirTalk has increased and the impact of COVID-19 has decreased. 

 AI
Camera Service 

With
our AI camera service, photographs are taken of the faces of residents at care facilities and stored in the cloud. AI cameras, currently
we specifically use the DeepLens created by Amazon, are placed in facility entrances, and when a relevant individual attempts to leave,
the AI camera identifies this person and dispatches a notification to the supervisor of the facility such as by email or using a siren.
This allows facility staff to stop the individual from leaving. The launch of this service initially targeted care facilities; however,
there are a variety of different potential applications. 

 Features 

 AI
camera is a system that uses face recognition technology to prevent wandering and prevent unauthorized outings from medical institutions.
To date, we have been pairing our AI camera service with Amazon's AWS DeepLens, a camera which can be used in multiple focal planes.
This service is for wander prevention purposes, and it has the capability to detect people who are, and are not,
wearing surgical masks , outsiders entering a restricted area , and in general allows for the detection of men, women,
animals, etc. AI Camera Service s settings will allow it to detect individuals whose faces are stored in the data server and/or
individuals whose features are not stored in the data server, and alerts can be sent out depending upon the user s settings and
preferences. 

 Face
recognition detects the movement of a target person who may be wandering about when going out of the entrance / exit of the facility,
and alerts the facility staff with a warning sound or a detection alert. In addition, by utilizing the mobile notification function,
it is possible to know the wandering behavior of the target person trying to go out in real time even if there is no facility staff or
manager nearby, so quick response and information sharing are possible. 

 Current
status 

 Currently,
AI camera service s host system is being further developed and improved by Ueda Tsusho Co., Ltd. 

On
January 1, 2020, OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd entered into an agreement with Ueda Tsusho Ltd to administer AirTalk , and to provide
further development and maintenance of AirTalk and the Company s other various software and hardware it may have,
such as the Company s AI system, all to be further developed on an ongoing need be basis. OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd shall compensate
Ueda Tsusho Ltd in the amount of JPY 40,000 (approximately 380) per day; in this case a day will be defined as a calendar
day during which services have been rendered. The total amount of days will be totaled and accordingly invoiced by Ueda Tsusho Ltd. to
the Company at the end of the month, and the Company will be responsible for remitting full payment the following month. Any additional
services not covered by the agreement shall receive compensation determined on a case by case basis. The term of the agreement shall
be from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, with automatic (unless terminated) extension for additional year long periods. On January
1, 2023 the agreement was automatically renewed for another twelve month period. 

We
released the AI camera service in September of 2022, but we have thus far not realized any sales. We have not yet commenced any marketing
efforts, and at present we rely entirely on prospective clients to contact us pertaining to this service. We may, if possible, rely upon
the personal and professional relationships of our sole Officer and Director in order to acquire future clients. 

Beacon
Business 

 Over
the past two years we have sold beacon devices that broadcast over a diameter of 900 m while using Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) 4.0. Because this signal can be received using a smartphone, it can be used to look after children and the elderly. It can also
be used for the protection of objects, and therefore to retrieve lost or dropped property. 

 Currently,
OFF Line Co., Ltd. has an existing inventory of Beacons available, but sales have been paused indefinitely while development of BLE 5.0
remains ongoing. We do not yet have a definitive timeframe for when development of BLE 5.0 will conclude. Manufacturing of Beacons is
conducted by an unrelated third party. We purchase inventory from OFF Line Co., Ltd, on a need be basis without any formal agreement,
who in turn purchases their inventory from Betz Technik Industries, Ltd on a need be basis, and with no formal agreement. We plan to
continue to purchase beacons from OFF Line Co., Ltd. and sell them to nursing institutes. It should be noted that OFF Line Co., Ltd.
is also owned and controlled by our sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka. 

 Drone
Management System Development and Entrusted System Development 

 The
current newest Bluetooth standard is BLE 5.0. OFF Line is currently in the process of developing a new drone identification system using
this Bluetooth 5.0 standard. By placing BLE 5.0 on a GPS chip, signals can be broadcast to a clear-air distance of around 3.5 km. This
technology is currently under development; however, we have been able to transmit a drone s location information up to a radius
of 3.5 km using a BLE 5.0 chip mounted on that drone, detect this signal using a smartphone, and indicate the drone s location
on Google Maps. 

 As
of today, throughout the world drones lack any kind of registration plate system. Accordingly, it is impossible to distinguish
between drones performing legitimate tasks, such as surveying, and drones being used to take privacy-invading photos and video. OFF Line,
in anticipation of the establishment of laws applying to drones in the future, will equip drones with BLE 5.0 beacons and register the
purpose of drone flights on servers. We intend to develop a system by which ordinary people can recognize drones in flight with their
smartphones to find out what company is flying those drones and for what purpose. 

 The
Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, with whom our officer
has met, have already inquired as to the feasibility of this system, and OFF Line plans to complete development within the year. Once
the system is complete, we are considering contacting not only authorities within Japan but US states as well to ascertain their interest
in its adoption. 

As
of the date of this report, development on the drone management system remains ongoing and is currently focused on the development of
BLE 5.0. We cannot state with any level of certainty when development of BLE 5.0 will conclude. 

OFF
Line Japan just released a primitive version of BLE5.0 smartphone bases communication app on google store in March 2023. Development
remains ongoing.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies
is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated
basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest
rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating
forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 2,384 and 46,060, respectively. Currently, our cash
balance is not sufficient to fund our operations and our revenues cannot cover our costs and expenses for any substantive period of time.
We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from OFF Line Co., Ltd., owned and managed by Koichi Ishizuka, our CEO. Zentrum Holdings,
Inc., and Koichi Ishizuka, however, have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company.
In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require further funding. Being a start-up stage company,
we have very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period, we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements
for such financing. 

If
we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations
entirely. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company borrowed 150,808 and 182,580 from OFF Line Co., Ltd., a Company controlled by
Koichi Ishizuka, CEO. The total due to related party as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 564,798 and 479,013 and are unsecured, due
on demand and non-interest bearing. 

Revenues 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues in the amount of 0 and 13,262, respectively. The decrease is attributed
to the fact that we have temporarily halted prior efforts selling our beacon devices. We expect to resume sales efforts when we have
completed a revised and improved version of the beacon. 

Net
Loss 

We
recorded a net loss of 253,188 and 237,618 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Cash
flow 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash used in operating activities was 188,656 and 220,352 respectively. Negative cash flow
resulted due to the fact that expense costs were more than revenue. 

For

For
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash provided by financing activities was 150,808 and 182,580, respectively. Financing activities
were proceeds from due to related party. 

Working
capital 

As

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that
contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the early stage
of operations and has reoccurring net losses and negative cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its
operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue- producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain
is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business
opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.
However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Zentrum Holdings, Inc. 

 Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zentrum Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for
each of the years then ended and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

 Going
Concern 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had insufficient revenues to provide sufficient cash flows to enable the Company to
finance its operations internally, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical
Audit Matters 

 The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

 Going
Concern 

 As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had a going concern due to the cumulative net loss year-over-year which
resulted in stockholders deficiency. 

 Auditing
management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates
on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated. 

 To
evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluate the financial information that was the initial cause along
with management s plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer who also serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Office who
also serves as our Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka, has reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the report December 31, 2020 and has concluded that
(i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission, and (ii)
the Company s controls and procedures have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31 2022, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting is ineffective based on those criteria. 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting
process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

 The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our Chief Executive Officer considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate
compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, inadequate segregation of duties consistent with
control objectives, lack of well-established procedures to identify, approve and report related party transactions, and lack of an audit
committee. 

 Management
believes that the material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of
a functioning audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

 Management
recognizes that its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving
as officers and as such is actively seeking to remediate this issue. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

We
will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors
to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake
the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates
and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. 

We
will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives; however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow
from operations will likely slow this implementation. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

There
have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Mr.
Koichi Ishizuka, Age 51 -
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer 

Background
of Mr. Koichi Ishizuka 

In
2004 Mr. Koichi Ishizuka graduated with his MBA from the University of Aoyama Gakuin. Several years later in 2011 he graduated from the
Advanced Management Program at Harvard School of Business. Following Mr. Ishizuka s formal education, he took a position as the
head of marketing with Thomson Reuters, a mass media and information firm. Thereafter, he served as the CEO of Xinhua Finance Japan in
2006, Fate Corporation in 2008, and LCA Holdings., Ltd in 2009. Currently, Mr. Ishizuka serves as the Chief Executive Officer of OFF
Line Co., Ltd., Photozou Co., Ltd., OFF Line International, Inc., and Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. He has held the position of CEO with
OFF Line Co., Ltd. Since 2013, Photozou Co., Ltd since 2016, OFF Line International, Inc since 2017 and Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. since
2017. Off Line Co., Ltd. manages and operates a Japanese communication application named, AirTalk. This is Off Line
Co., Ltd. s primary business activity. In June 2018, he incorporated OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation. On November
22, 2019, he incorporated OFF Line International, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

As
of the date of this filing, there has not been any material plan, contract or arrangement (whether or not written) to which our sole
officer and director are a party in connection with their appointments at Zentrum Holdings, Inc. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had no employees outside of our sole officer and director. 

Director s
Term of Office 

Directors
will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and the election and qualification of their successors. Officers are elected
annually by our board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. Presently, we have a single director, Koichi
Ishizuka. 

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements
and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. Our sole officer and director review the Company's
internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director believes that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the Director can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
Board has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined
in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in
Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the
FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures
for financial reporting. The Director of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management
believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining
an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
sole officer and director have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any conviction in a criminal
 proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being subject to any order,
 judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily
 enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities;
 or 
 
 4. 
 being found by a court
 of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal
 or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and
 the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such person was found by
 a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities
 law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed,
 suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii)
 Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent
 injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal
 or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity;
 or 
 
 8. 
 Such person was the subject
 of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as
 defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of
 the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary
 authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board of Directors, consisting solely of Koichi Ishizuka, evaluated the business of the
Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of
fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our
operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Registration Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of
any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date.
