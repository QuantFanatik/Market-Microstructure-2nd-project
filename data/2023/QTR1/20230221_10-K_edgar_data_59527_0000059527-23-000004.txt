 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term Company, except as otherwise indicated by the context, means Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest. The Lincoln Electric Company began operations in 1895 and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1906. During 1998, The Lincoln Electric Company reorganized into a holding company structure, and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. became the publicly-held parent of Lincoln Electric subsidiaries worldwide, including The Lincoln Electric Company. The Company is one of only a few worldwide broad-line manufacturers of welding, cutting and brazing products. The Company is the world leader in the design, development and manufacture of arc welding products, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment. The Company also has a leading global position in brazing and soldering alloys. The Company s products include arc welding, brazing and soldering filler metals (consumables), arc welding equipment, plasma and oxyfuel cutting systems, wire feeding systems, fume control equipment, welding accessories, specialty gas regulators, and education solutions; as well as a comprehensive portfolio of automated solutions for joining, cutting, material handling, module assembly, and end of line testing. The arc welding power sources and wire feeding systems manufactured by the Company range in technology from basic units used for light manufacturing and maintenance to highly sophisticated robotic applications for high volume production welding and fabrication. Three primary types of arc welding consumables are produced: (1) coated manual or stick electrodes; (2) solid wire produced in coil, reel or drum forms for continuous feeding in mechanized welding; and (3) cored wire produced in coil form for continuous feeding in mechanized welding. The Company has, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Company s business units are aligned into three operating segments. The operating segments consist of Americas Welding, International Welding and The Harris Products Group. The Americas Welding segment includes welding operations in North and South America. The International Welding segment includes welding operations in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The Harris Products Group includes the Company s global cutting, soldering and brazing businesses, specialty gas equipment, as well as the retail business in the United States. On December 1, 2022, the Company acquired Fori Automation, LLC Fori for a cash purchase price of 427,000, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Fori is a leading designer and manufacturer of complex, multi-armed automated welding systems, with an extensive range of automated assembly systems, automated material handling solutions, automated large-scale, industrial guidance vehicles, and end of line testing systems. The Fori acquisition will extend the Company s market presence within the automotive sector as well as its automation footprint in the International Welding segment. Customers The Company s products are sold in both domestic and international markets. In the Americas, products are sold principally through industrial distributors, retailers and also directly to users of welding products (OEMs, manufacturers and integrators). Outside of the Americas, the Company has an international sales organization comprised of Company employees and agents who sell products from the Company s various manufacturing sites to distributors and product users.

 The Company s major end-user markets include: general fabrication, energy (oil and gas, power generation and process industries), heavy industries (heavy fabrication, ship building and maintenance and repair), automotive and transportation, and construction and infrastructure. 
 The Company is not dependent on a single customer or a few customers and no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total Net sales. However, the loss of a large customer could have an adverse effect on the Company s business. The Company s operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including an increase in interest rates, inflationary pressures and fluctuations in foreign currency rates. The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature. Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by economic cycles and the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors. The Company experiences some variability in reported period-to-period results as historical demand for the Company s products is mildly seasonal with generally higher demand in the second and third quarters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion regarding risks associated with customers, general economic conditions and demand. Competition Conditions in the arc welding and cutting industry are highly competitive. The Company believes it is the world s largest manufacturer of consumables and equipment with relatively few major broad-line competitors worldwide, but numerous smaller competitors in specific geographic markets. The Company continues to pursue strategies to heighten its competitiveness in domestic and international markets, which includes positioning low cost manufacturing facilities in most geographical markets. Competition in the arc welding and cutting industry is based on brand preference, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support. The Company believes its performance against these factors has contributed to the Company s position as the leader in the industry. Most of the Company s products may be classified as standard commercial articles and are manufactured for stock. The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of its highly trained technical sales force and the support of its welding research and development staff to assist customers in optimizing their welding applications. This allows the Company to introduce its products to new users and to establish and maintain close relationships with its customers. This close relationship between the technical sales force and the direct customers, together with its supportive relationship with its distributors, who are particularly interested in handling the broad range of the Company s products, is an important element of the Company s market success and a valuable asset of the Company. Raw Materials The principal raw materials essential to the Company s business are steel, electronic components, engines, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, robotic components and various chemicals, all of which are normally available for purchase in the open market. Patents and Trademarks The Company holds many valuable patents, primarily in arc welding, and actively protects its innovations as research and development has progressed in both the United States and major international jurisdictions. The Company believes its trademarks are an important asset and aggressively pursues brand management.

 Environmental Regulations The Company s facilities are subject to environmental regulations. To date, compliance with these environmental regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company s earnings. The Company is ISO 14001 certified at most significant manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe and is progressing towards certification at its remaining facilities worldwide. In addition, the Company is ISO 9001 certified at 42 facilities worldwide. The Company ensures compliance as well as the continuous improvement of the environmental performance of its products and operations through its global Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality EHS Q systems. The Company s systems are guided by the Corporate EHS Q Policy, global directives and corporate standards that establish consistent guidelines for the management, measurement and reporting of environmental, health and safety activities, as well as quality across the Company s global platform. The Company s products support our customers sustainability initiatives through enhanced worker safety, reduced emissions, improved energy efficiency, reduced waste and regulatory compliance. International Operations The Company conducts a significant amount of its business and has a number of operating facilities in countries outside the United States. As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent to non-U.S. activities, including political uncertainty, import and export limitations, exchange controls and currency fluctuations. Human Capital Management Employee Profile The Company s employees are its most valuable asset as they represent the foundation of the Company and its future success. The number of persons employed by the Company worldwide at December 31, 2022 was approximately 12,000. Employee Engagement The Company strongly believes that employee engagement drives better business results and that a highly engaged workforce can increase innovation, productivity and bottom-line performance while reducing costs. The Company engages employees through individual, small group and town hall meetings, its Advisory Board, global intranet, employee surveys, resource groups, health and safety communications and initiatives, training and development, employee wellness programs, and an ethics hotline, among other vehicles. Talent Management and Development In order to ensure the competitiveness of our workforce as well as a strong succession pipeline, the Company provides development opportunities to advance skills, knowledge and expertise. The Company s programs include formal leadership, management and professional development programs, tuition reimbursement for external accredited programs, mentoring, self-guided online courses, instructor-led programs and special project and rotational assignments that can lead to extensive global exposure. Diversity and Inclusion The Company has a longstanding commitment to equal opportunity in all aspects of employment including employee compensation, job placement and promotion regardless of gender, race or other personal characteristics. The Company s culture is underpinned by its core values, including the guiding principles championed by James F. and John C. Lincoln when they founded Lincoln Electric over 125 years ago The Golden Rule: Treat Others How You Would Like to Be Treated. The Company has implemented several measures that focus on ensuring that accountability exists for making progress in diversity. The CEO and other senior leaders have diversity and inclusion objectives as part of their annual

Table of Contents 
 performance goals. The Company focuses on diverse talent sourcing strategies and partners with external organizations that develop and supply diverse talent. The Company reviews and updates its human resources processes and benchmarks roles and compensation externally on a regular basis to help prevent bias and promote a diverse and inclusive workplace. Compensation The Company s compensation program is designed to attract and retain exceptional employees and to maintain a strong pay for performance culture. The Company has designed its compensation system to reflect current best practices, including setting base pay below the competitive market for each position, targeting incentive-based cash compensation above the competitive market and promoting quality corporate governance in compensation decisions. The Company s annual talent and succession planning process reviews 100 of its global professional staff worldwide to support the development of a talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering and operations. This evaluation includes the Company s CEO, as well as segment business and functional leaders, and focuses on high potential talent, diverse talent and succession within the Company s most critical roles. The Company believes that the practices outlined above result in sustained increases in shareholder value and reflect its compensation philosophy of aligning long-term pay and performance. Health and Safety Health and safety is a priority for the Company, its vision is an accident-free workplace with zero safety incidents. The Company follows a rigorous health and safety program that adheres to stringent safety standards and best practices to ensure its manufacturing operations, related processes and products do not negatively impact the health and welfare of its employees, customers and neighbors. In addition to Company-led programs and employee engagement in behavior-based safety and wellness committees, the Company actively engages in health and safety standard development committees at key industry organizations such as the American Welding Society, the International Institute of Welding and across various International Standards Organization committees to ensure best practices for its employees and end users. The Company s standard health and safety programs adhere to stringent safety standards and best practices to ensure that its operations, related processes and products do not negatively impact the health and welfare of its employees, customers or community. Community Engagement The Company is an active member in the communities in which it operates and where its employees live. The Company participates in community meetings, local business associations, offers plant visits, provides grants to nonprofit organizations and donates resources and time through in-kind gifts, employee volunteerism and non-profit board service. The Company s partnership with academia includes executive-led lectures and donations of equipment and engineering expertise to support lab and research initiatives. In addition, the Company supports community educational / career programming among secondary and high school students in order to address skills gaps in the industry and maintain awareness of attractive career pathways in manufacturing. See Part I, Item 1C for information regarding the Company s executive officers, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The SEC also maintains a website, www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The content on any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report unless expressly noted. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS From time to time, information we provide, statements by our employees or information included in our filings with the SEC may contain forward-looking statements that are not historical facts. Those statements are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as may, will, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, believe, forecast, guidance or words of similar meaning. Actual results may differ materially from such statements due to a variety of factors that could adversely affect the Company s operating results. Forward-looking statements, and our future performance, operating results, financial position and liquidity, are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect results, including those risks described below. Forward-looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date of the statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update those statements. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our Enterprise Risk Management ERM process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks. We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks. Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks. The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them. Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value. However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10- K, should be carefully considered. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Readers should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not yet already materialized.

 Risks Related to Economic Conditions General economic, financial and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets. Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Recessionary economic cycles, global supply chain disruptions, higher logistics costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher raw materials costs, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or trade laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products. An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets. In March 2022, in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the Company announced it had ceased operations in Russia and implemented plans to support its Russian employees. Although the Company s Net sales and Total assets in Russia were less than 1 of consolidated Net sales and Total assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and sanctions imposed globally may result in economic and supply chain disruptions, the ultimate financial impact of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company continues to monitor the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its potential impacts. We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States. As a growing global enterprise, the share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant. This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States. If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations, including: Political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil; Corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, tariffs, data protection and privacy requirements, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention); International terrorism and hostilities; Changes in the global regulatory environment, including revised or newly created laws, regulations or standards relating to the Company, our products or the markets in which we operate; and Significant fluctuations in relative currency values; in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, as well as the imposition of exchange controls, currency devaluations and hyperinflation. 
 The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance. The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature. Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity. If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products and have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Risks Related to Manufacturing and Operations Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes, natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, pandemics, including the current coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic , labor disputes and natural disasters, including events caused by climate change. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses. We continue to experience supply shortages and inflationary pressures for certain components and raw materials due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future as markets recover. Although we have secured additional supply from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Maintaining higher inventory levels to service customers may result in excess or obsolete inventory and related charges if demand for these products is lower than our expectations. This may adversely affect financial results. Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas). The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, including the current rising inflationary pressure. They are also influenced by import duties and tariffs speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, government trade practices and regulations and other factors. Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold. Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business. We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems. The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems, which contain confidential information related to our customers, suppliers and employees and other proprietary business information. We maintain some of these systems and are also dependent on a number of critical corporate infrastructure services provided by third parties relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and finance functions. Like many multinational companies, our systems are subject to regular cyber attacks and other malicious efforts to cause cyber security incidents. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our business or operations. However, if as a result of future attacks, our systems are significantly damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company continues 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 to invest in cyber security, including maintaining and improving cyber security resilience, and the Company s cyber security risks are regularly monitored by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, due to the nature of cyber threats, there can be no assurance that our preventive efforts can fully mitigate the risks of all cyber incidents, and a significant security breach could result in financial loss, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations. Any of these could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Human Capital Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical (including research and development) personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense and compensation rates are increasing due to lower labor availability. Under these conditions, we may not succeed in identifying, attracting or retaining qualified personnel. With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool. Any interruption of our workforce, including rationalization efforts related to the integration of acquired businesses, interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Business Strategy We may not be able to complete our acquisition or divestiture strategies, successfully integrate acquired businesses and in certain cases we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters. Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us. Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition. Integration efforts may include significant rationalization activities that could be disruptive to the business. Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets. Additionally, from time to time we may identify assets for strategic divestitures that would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.

 If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenues, gross margins and results of operations may suffer. Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics. We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive. We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth. Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours. We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage. Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position. Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products. The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, results of operations and prospects. We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products. We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support. We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business with market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness, including with respect to the integration of acquired businesses. Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our revenue, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available. Our competitive position could be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business. For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products and robotic arm manufacturers compete in the automated welding and cutting space. In addition, in certain markets of the world, distributors manufacture and sell arc welding products. Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice. We may incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate rationalization actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. We may take additional actions in the future to further optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but are not limited to asset impairments, employee severance costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension settlements, any of which could be

 significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future rationalization plans in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding rationalization plans, refer to the rationalization and asset impairment related disclosure under Note 7 to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness. Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 1,483 plaintiffs. In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants. The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers. Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 56,877 of those claims were dismissed, 23 were tried to defense verdicts, 7 were tried to plaintiff verdicts (which were reversed or resolved after appeal), 1 was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 1,012 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions. The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers. While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience. Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981. We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us or failure to meet contractual performance commitments. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell. Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects. We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage. Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result. In certain cases, we design automated welding systems for use in a customer s production facilities (including automotive production facilities), which could expose us to financial losses or professional liability. The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users. We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims. Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. Even if we are successful defending such claims or product liability coverage is adequate, claims of this nature could cause customers to lose confidence in our products and our Company. Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed.

 We may incur losses if we do not achieve contractual commitments, including project performance requirements or project schedules. Project performance can be affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, availability of materials, changes in the project scope of services, environmental conditions or labor disruptions. In addition, our backlog consists of the expected revenue from projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a customer. Project cancellations, scope adjustments, deferrals or changes in cost estimates may reduce the dollar amount of revenue and profits that we actually earn. Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability. Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by the United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements. We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily. We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.

 We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. A number of governments and agencies in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions have proposed and may continue to introduce regulatory changes to address climate change, including regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions. We may be subject to additional regulations or restrictions in jurisdictions where we operate, including charges to fund additional energy-efficient activities, assessments or fees, and operational restrictions such as reduced emission allowances. Compliance with climate change regulations and restrictions may result in additional costs, including increased production costs and taxes, which could adversely impact our financial position. In addition, climate change regulations and related operating restrictions may unfavorably affect our competitive position with companies who may not be subject to equivalent requirements in their jurisdictions. In addition, negative publicity or public perception of climate change issues associated with us or our industry may cause reputational damage and financial harm to the Company. ITEM 1B.

 Other Income (Expense): The increase in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to non-cash pension settlement charges in 2021 related to the termination of a pension plan. Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for details. Income Taxes: The 2022 effective tax rate was higher than 2021 primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, as well as the impact of the 2021 pension plan termination. Segment Results Net Sales: The table below summarizes the impacts of volume, acquisitions, price and foreign currency exchange rates on Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022:

 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes Adjusted EBIT ): Segment performance is measured and resources are allocated based on a number of factors, the primary measure being the Adjusted EBIT profit measure. EBIT is defined as Operating income plus Equity earnings in affiliates and Other income. EBIT is adjusted for special items as determined by management such as the impact of rationalization activities, certain asset impairment charges and gains or losses on disposals of assets. The following table presents Adjusted EBIT by segment:

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company reviews Adjusted operating income, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted net income, Adjusted effective tax rate, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted return on invested capital, and Adjusted net operating profit after taxes, all non-GAAP financial measures, in assessing and evaluating the Company s underlying operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of special items on the Company s reported financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP financial measures, as non-GAAP measures are a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. From time to time, management evaluates and discloses to investors the following non-GAAP measures: Free cash flow FCF ), defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures (the Company considers FCF to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about how the amount of cash generated by our business, after the purchase of property and equipment, can be used for debt service, acquisitions, paying dividends and repurchasing our common shares); Cash conversion, defined as FCF divided by Adjusted net income; Organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of foreign currency and acquisitions.

 anticipates the Company will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets. The Company continues to expand globally and periodically looks at transactions that would involve significant investments. The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market. The Company s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding. Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the United States, and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary that requires funding. If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made. The following table reflects changes in key cash flow measures: 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Cash provided by operating activities (1) 383,386 365,063 18,323 Cash used by investing activities (2) (504,691) (205,356) (299,335) Capital expenditures (71,883) (62,531) (9,352) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (436,298) (156,106) (280,192) Cash provided by (used by) financing activities (3) 133,725 (221,940) 355,665 Proceeds from short-term borrowings 34,351 46,476 (12,125) Proceeds from (payments on) long-term borrowings 405,444 (508) 405,952 Purchase of shares for treasury (181,293) (164,526) (16,767) Cash dividends paid to shareholders (130,724) (121,851) (8,873) Increase (decrease) in Cash and cash equivalents (4) 4,192 (64,321) 68,513 (1) Cash provided by operating activities increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to higher company earnings. (2) Cash used by investing activities increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 due to cash used in the acquisition of businesses in 2022. The Company currently anticipates capital expenditures of 80,000 to 100,000 in 2023. Anticipated capital expenditures include investments to increase capacity and improve operational effectiveness. Management critically evaluates all proposed capital expenditures and expects each project to increase efficiency, reduce costs, promote business growth or improve the overall safety and environmental conditions of the Company s facilities. (3) Cash provided by (used by) financing activities increased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 due to higher long-term borrowings in 2022 partially offset by an increase in the purchase of shares for treasury. (4) Cash and cash equivalents increased 2.2 , or 4,192, to 197,950 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 192,958 as of December 31, 2021. The increase was predominantly due to higher cash provided by operating activities and an increase in long term borrowings offset by increase in cash used in the purchase of common shares for treasury, dividends paid to shareholders and for the acquisition of businesses in 2022. 
 The Company paid 130,724 and 121,851 in cash dividends to its shareholders in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In January 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of 0.64 per share, or 36,879, to shareholders of record on December 31, 2022, which reflects a 14.3 increase in the Company s dividend payout rate.

(3) Average operating working capital excluding Fori would have been 18.6 as a percent of Net sales. 
 Rationalization and Asset Impairments Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company s rationalization plans. The Company believes the rationalization actions will positively impact future results of operations and will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital. Acquisitions Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company s recent acquisitions. Debt At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of debt outstanding was 1,203,879 and 769,819, respectively, while the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately 1,009,020 and 776,655, respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment. The carrying value of this debt at such dates was 1,121,435 and 717,855, respectively. Since judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange. Senior Unsecured Notes On April 1, 2015 and October 20, 2016, the Company entered into separate Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the Notes through a private placement. The Notes each have an aggregate principal amount of 350,000. Interest on the Notes are payable semi-annually. The proceeds of the Notes were used for general corporate purposes. The Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants relating to the Notes. The Company s total weighted average effective interest rate and remaining weighted average term, inclusive of the 2015 Notes and 2016 Notes, is 3.3 and 11.4 years, respectively.

 Revolving Credit Agreements On April 23, 2021, the Company amended and restated the agreement governing its line of credit by entering into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement has a line of credit totaling 500,000, has a term of 5 years with a maturity date of April 23, 2026 and may be increased, subject to certain conditions including the consent of its lenders, by an additional amount up to 150,000. The interest rate on borrowings is based on LIBOR plus a spread based on the Company s net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type (subject to negotiated baskets and exceptions), including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had 45,000 of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Company has other lines of credit and debt agreements totaling 92,078. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had 37,444 outstanding at December 31, 2022. Term Loan On November 29, 2022, the Company entered into a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 400,000 (the Term Loan ), which was borrowed in full. The Term Loan matures on November 29, 2025. The Term Loan bears an interest at a rate based on Term SOFR, plus a margin ranging from 0.75 to 1.75 based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with the acquisition of Fori. The agreement governing the Term Loan (the Term Loan Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, as well as customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. The Term Loan Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio and maximum consolidated net leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants. Shelf Agreements On November 27, 2018, the Company entered into seven uncommitted master note facilities (the Shelf Agreements that allow borrowings up to 700,000 in the aggregate. The Shelf Agreements have a five-year term and the average life of borrowings cannot exceed 15 years. The Company is required to comply with covenants similar to those contained in the 2015 Notes and 2016 Notes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the Shelf Agreements. Return on Invested Capital The Company reviews return on invested capital ROIC in assessing and evaluating the Company s underlying operating performance. Adjusted ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital. Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Amounts due banks, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity.

Table of Contents 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 17,424 of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and a 39,090 liability for deferred compensation. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur. Stock-Based Compensation On April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan Employee Plan ). The Employee Plan provides for the granting of options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based awards up to an additional 5,400,000 of the Company s common shares. In addition, on April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors 2015 Director Plan ). The 2015 Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 300,000 of the Company s common shares. At December 31, 2022, there were 1,381,427 common shares available for future grant under all plans. Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 284,946 in 2022 and 313,547 in 2021. The Company issued common shares from treasury upon all exercises of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2022 and 2021. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2022 and 2021 was 25,276 and 23,787, respectively, with a related tax benefit of 6,363 and 5,988, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock units was 17,610, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable, which would have been received by the optionees, had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2022 was 58,282 and 49,024, respectively. The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during 2022 and 2021 was 7,082 and 20,442, respectively. Product Liability Costs Product liability costs incurred can be volatile and are largely related to trial activity. The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred. The long-term impact of product liability contingencies, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers. Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations. Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company s Credit Agreement. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used. If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated. Historically, the Company s estimates have been determined to be reasonable. No material changes to the Company s

 accounting policies were made during 2022. The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations. Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, administrative claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses. The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred. Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period. With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome. The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience. If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation. Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly. Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made. Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change. Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims. Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves. The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions. The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published. The Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain income tax positions in various jurisdictions. The Company uses judgment in determining whether the technical merits of tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. Judgment is also used in measuring the related amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition, including the interpretation of applicable tax law, regulation and tax ruling. Liabilities are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Liabilities can be affected by changes in applicable tax law, regulations, tax rulings or such other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate. Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for uncertain income tax positions; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of uncertain income tax positions. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The Company repatriates earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to foreign withholding taxes. The Company considers remaining earnings in all other non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and has not recorded any deferred taxes as such estimate is not practicable. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 142,430 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards, which may reduce taxable income in future years. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more-likely-than-not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. At December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of 44,627 was recorded against certain deferred tax assets based on this assessment. The

 Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes. Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit Pension and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees. These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors. The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation. Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans. A significant element in determining the Company s pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities. To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality. The Company determined this rate to be 4.3 at December 31, 2022 and 1.8 at December 31, 2021. A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact to pension expense. The Company s defined benefit plan (income) expense was (2,280) and 124,929 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pension expense includes 367 and 126,013 in settlement charges in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s defined contribution plan expense was 29,569 and 26,281 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company expects total 2023 expense related to retirement plans to increase by a range of approximately 500 to 1,500, excluding settlement charges. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was 3,759 as of December 31, 2022 and 16,173 as of December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily the result of a pension plan termination described below. In March 2020, the Company approved an amendment to terminate the Lincoln Electric Company Retirement Annuity Program RAP plan effective as of December 31, 2020. The Company provided notice to participants of the intent to terminate the plan and applied and received a determination letter. During 2021, pension obligations were distributed through a combination of lump sum payments to eligible plan participants and through the purchase of a group annuity contract in October 2021. The lump sum payments and annuity purchase resulted in pre-tax settlement charges of 126,056 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The remaining surplus assets of 68,458 at December 31, 2021 were transferred to a suspense account in January 2022 and are being used to fund employer matching contributions in a qualified employee savings plan. The surplus assets as of December 31, 2022 were 56,418 and are recorded in Other current assets and Other assets in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs. Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a LIFO basis. LIFO was used for 38 and 36 of total inventories at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a FIFO basis. The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Actual year-end inventory levels and costs may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations. The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was 133,909 at December 31, 2022 and 114,176 at December 31, 2021. The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors. If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management,

 and the Company s estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required. Historically, the Company s reserves have approximated actual experience. Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets, including leases and intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives, to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same date each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is only required if the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company may also perform a quantitative test in instances where the more-likely-than-not threshold has not been met, including when general macroeconomic conditions or changes to the reporting unit warrant a refresh of the baseline used in a qualitative test. For quantitative testing, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates to value estimated cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions, actual growth below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate could result in an impairment charge in a future period. Acquisitions Upon acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate. The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely on estimates and assumptions. Management values property, plant and equipment using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes consideration of obsolescence. Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, forms of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the acquired intangible assets include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of future cash flows (such as revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and royalty rates). Acquired inventories are marked to fair value. For certain items, the pre-acquisition carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to the Company. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. Substantially all of the Company s sales arrangements are short-term in nature involving a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer based upon shipping terms. In addition, certain customized automation performance obligations are accounted for over time. Under this method, revenue recognition is primarily based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete. The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses. Less than 10 of the Company s Net sales are recognized over time. The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded. Taxes collected by the Company, including sales tax and value added tax, are excluded from Net sales. The Company recognizes freight billed as a component of Net sales and shipping costs as a component of Cost of goods sold when control transfers to the customer. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is generally one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The Company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures. The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10 weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022, a 10 change in pricing of commodity contracts and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates at December 31, 2022. The derivative, borrowing and investment arrangements in effect at December 31, 2022 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on the Company s current period consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. At December 31, 2022, the Company hedged certain third-party and intercompany purchases and sales. The gross notional dollar amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2022 was 66,296. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by 284. The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross-border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date. The gross notional dollar amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2022 was 380,443. A hypothetical 10 change in the year-end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease to Income before income taxes of 12,936 related to these positions. However, any loss (or gain) resulting from a hypothetical 10 change would be offset by the associated gain (or loss) on the underlying balance sheet exposure and would ultimately not materially affect the Company s financial statements. The Company also has a foreign currency forward contract hedge designated as a net

 investment hedge with a notional dollar amount of 88,843 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by 8,758. Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases. These hedging arrangements have the effect of fixing for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates. The notional amount of these contracts was 875,000 pounds at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10 change in the price would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the value of the contracts by 319. Interest Rate Risk In anticipation of future debt issuance associated with the Notes referenced in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has interest rate forward starting swap agreements to hedge the variability of future changes in interest rates. The gross notional dollar value of these contracts was 100,000 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to effective interest rates would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by 7,584. At December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to variable interest rates would have changed Interest expense by approximately 5,600. The fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 approximated cost due to the short-term duration. These financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments. The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The response to this item is submitted in a separate section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K following the signature page. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company s evaluation under such framework, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Fori. Fori s assets are included in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet from the date of the acquisition and constituted approximately 14.6 of total assets as of December 31, 2022. As permitted by guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has elected to exclude Fori from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In December 2022, the Company acquired Fori. The acquired business operated under its own set of systems and internal controls and the Company is currently maintaining those systems and much of that control environment until it is able to incorporate its processes into the Company s own systems and control environment. The Company expects to complete the incorporation of the acquired business operations into the Company s systems and control environment in 2023. Except for changes in connection with the Company s acquisition of Fori business noted above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

 Goodwill impairment evaluation Reporting Unit within International Welding Segment Description of the Matter As disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022, the Company s total goodwill was 665.3 million, of that, 129.9 million relates to the International Welding segment. As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same date each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company may perform a quantitative test in instances where the more-likely-than-not threshold has not been met, including when general macroeconomic conditions or changes to the reporting unit warrant a refresh of the baseline used in a qualitative test. The Company performed a quantitative assessment for a reporting unit within the International Welding segment and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value. Auditing the annual goodwill impairment test for the aforementioned reporting unit under the quantitative assessment was complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate using the income approach was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal period revenue growth rate. Elements of these significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment evaluation, including controls over the significant assumptions mentioned above. To test the estimated fair value used in the Company s annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit within the International Welding segment, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the valuation methodology, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. As it pertains to the terminal period revenue growth rate, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to third party industry data and economic trends, changes to the Company s business model, customer base or product mix, as applicable. We involved valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology applied and the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management, including, the weighted average cost of capital. Specifically, we evaluated the components of the weighted average cost of capital assumptions used by performing an independent corroborative analysis with involvement of valuation specialists. We performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the significant assumptions.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Fori Automation, LLC (Fori), which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 14.6 of total assets as of December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Fori. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As a result, the financial statements of the Company s Turkish operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of April 1, 2022. Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company s Turkish operation have been remeasured into the Company s reporting currency (U.S. dollar). Beginning April 1, 2022, the exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this impact was not significant to the Company s results.

Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.

 and of total inventories, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a first-in, first-out FIFO basis. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. to for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to for buildings. Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur. Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress. Buildings Machinery and equipment Less accumulated depreciation Total Leases The Company determines if an agreement is a lease at inception. The Company records a right-of-use asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheets to represent its right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The Company records a lease liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets to represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date to present value the lease payments.

 to or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company s sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance sheets. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets and finite-lived intangible assets, to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Refer to Notes 5, 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

 while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued. The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments. Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions. The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by monitoring the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty. Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts and commodity contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the fair value unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other assets, Other current liabilities or Other liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract. At settlement, the realized gain or loss is recorded in Cost of goods sold or Net sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion on cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings. In anticipation of future debt issuance associated with the Notes referenced in Note 9, the Company has interest rate forward starting swap agreements to hedge the variability of future changes in interest rates. The forward starting swap agreements were qualified and designated as a cash flow hedge. The changes in fair value are recorded as part of AOCI, and upon completion of debt issuance and termination of the swaps, are amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. Fair value hedges Certain interest rate swap agreements were qualified and designated as fair value hedges. The interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these agreements are considered to exactly offset
