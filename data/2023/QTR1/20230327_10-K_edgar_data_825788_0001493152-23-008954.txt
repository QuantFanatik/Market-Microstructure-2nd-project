Background 

DiVall
Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership (the Partnership ), is a limited partnership organized under the Wisconsin
Uniform Limited Partnership Act pursuant to a Certificate of Limited Partnership dated as of November 20, 1987, and governed by a Limited
Partnership Agreement, as amended from time to time (collectively, the Partnership Agreement ). The Partnership is managed
by its general partner, The Provo Group, Inc. TPG or the General Partner ). As of December 31, 2022, the
Partnership had 1,041 limited partners owning an aggregate of 46,280.3 Limited Partnership Interests (the Interests ). 

The
Partnership is engaged in the business of owning and operating its investment portfolio of commercial real estate properties (each a
 Property and collectively, the Properties ). At December 31, 2022, the Partnership owned 8 Properties, located
in a total of three states. 

At
December 31, 2022, seven of the eight Properties were (and continue to be) leased to Wendy s franchisees, with three of the
Properties being leased to Wendgusta, LLC Wendgusta ), two of the Properties being leased to JAI Hospitality RG, LLC JAI
Hospitality) and two of the Properties being leased to JAI Augusta, LLC JAI Augusta). Operating base rents from these seven leases
during the year ended December 31, 2022 comprised approximately 90 of the total 2022 operating base rents. During the year ended December
31, 2022, additional percentage rents were also generated from these seven Wendy s Properties and totaled 342,359. Additionally,
those seven Properties exceeded 80 of the Partnership s total Properties, both by historical asset value and number. Six of the
Properties that are currently leased to Wendy s franchisees feature lease expiration dates of December 31, 2040. The other Property
that is currently leased to a Wendy s franchisee feature a lease expiration date of November 6, 2026. 

See
Properties under Item 2 below for the table of all Properties and lease expirations and a discussion of Properties with significant developments
during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

During
the process of leasing the Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties. As a
result, in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, the General Partner may offer rental
concessions, or other inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnership s operations. The Partnership
is also in competition with sellers of similar properties who from time to time attempt to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties. 

The
Partnership Agreement provides that the Partnership is scheduled to be dissolved on November 30, 2023, or earlier upon the prior occurrence
of any of the following events: (a) the disposition of all its Properties; (b) the written determination by the General Partner, that
the Partnership s assets may constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA; (c) the agreement of limited partners
owning a majority of the outstanding Interests to dissolve the Partnership; or (d) the dissolution, bankruptcy, death, withdrawal, or
incapacity of the last remaining General Partner, unless an additional General Partner is elected previously by a majority of the limited
partners. 

During
the 2021 consent solicitation process, the Limited Partners approved two separate amendments to the Partnership Agreement. The amendments
served to: (i) extend the term of the Partnership by three (3) years to November 30, 2023, and (ii) permit the General Partner to effect
distributions at times that it deems appropriate, but no less often than semi-annually. In addition, the Limited Partners approved a
resolution granting the General Partner the authority to, at any time prior to November 30, 2023, sell all or substantially all of the
Partnership s assets and then liquidate and dissolve the Partnership without further approval from the Limited Partners.

The
Permanent Manager Agreement 

The
Permanent Manager Agreement PMA was entered into on February 8, 1993, between the Partnership, DiVall 1 (which was dissolved
in December 1998), DiVall 3 (which was dissolved in December 2003), the now former general partners, Gary J. DiVall and Paul E. Magnuson,
their controlled affiliates, and TPG, naming TPG as the Permanent Manager. The PMA contains provisions allowing TPG to submit to the
PMA, election of TPG as General Partner, and the issue of acceptance of the resignations of the former general partners to a vote of
the limited partners through a solicitation of written consents. 

TPG,
as the General Partner, has been operating and managing the affairs of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of the PMA and
the Partnership Agreement since February 8, 1993. 

Effective
January 1, 2023, the PMA was renewed by the General Partner for a two-year period ending December 31, 2024. The PMA can be terminated
earlier (a) by a vote at any time by a majority interest of the limited partners, (b) upon the dissolution and winding up of the Partnership,
(c) upon the entry of an order of a court finding that TPG has engaged in fraud or other like misconduct or has shown itself to be incompetent
in carrying out its duties under the Partnership Agreement, or (d) upon 60 days written notice from TPG to the limited partners
of the Partnership. 

Advisory
Board 

The
concept of the Advisory Board was first introduced by TPG during the solicitation of written consents seeking to elect TPG as the General
Partner. The first Advisory Board was established in October 1993. Among other functions, the three-person Advisory Board has the following
rights and duties: to review operational policies and practices; to review extraordinary transactions; to review internal financial controls
and practices; and to review the performance of the independent auditors of the Partnership. The Advisory Board s powers are advisory
only and the Advisory Board does not have the authority to direct management decisions or policies of the Partnership or remove the General
Partner. The Advisory Board has full and free access to the Partnership s books and records, and individual Advisory Board members
have the right to communicate directly with the limited partners concerning Partnership business. Members of the Advisory Board are compensated
 1,500 annually and 500 for each quarterly meeting attended. 

The
Advisory Board currently consists of limited partners of the Partnership: Jesse Small and Albert Kramer. For a brief description of each
Advisory Board member, refer to Item 10, Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant. 

No
Employees; Location of Business Operations 

The
Partnership has no employees. 

All
of the Partnership s business is conducted in the United States. 

Available

The
Partnership is required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form
8-K, along with any related amendments and supplements to these periodic and current reports. The SEC maintains a website containing
these reports and other information regarding our electronic filings at www.sec.gov .

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

The
Partnership s business, the ownership and lease of the Properties, is subject to a variety of risks attendant to the ownership
and lease of commercial real property, including risks related to: (i) changes in general economic conditions both nationally and in
the local markets where the Properties are located, (ii) changes in real estate conditions, including without limitation, decreases in
valuations of real properties, increases in property taxes and lack of buyers should the Partnership want to dispose of a Property, (iv)
lease-up risks, (v) ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations to the Partnership under existing leases, (vi) declines in sales
for tenants whose leases include a percentage rent component, (vii) adverse changes to the restaurant market, (viii) entrance of competitors
to the Partnership s lessees in markets in which the Properties are located, (ix) inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration
of existing leases, (x) the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows, (xi)
the Partnership s ability to realize value for Limited Partners upon disposition of the Properties, (xii) adverse effects on our
Properties and tenants caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and (xiii) various other factors. 

In
addition to the general risks identified above, the Partnership is also subject to various cyber security risks, including those generally
described below. 

Our
business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. 

Information
technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks
and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes
and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively
manage our key business processes including finance, administration and other business processes. These technologies enable internal
and external communication among our locations, supplies, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information
about our investors and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services
provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events,
natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers,
and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology
systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information
technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies,
data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information
technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

A
cyber-attack or other information security breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in financial losses. 

We
are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology
networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other
events that could have a security impact. If we are unable to prevent cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may encounter
significant disruptions in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or
result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such breaches may also harm our reputation, result in financial losses
or subject us to litigation or other costs or penalties.

2. Properties 

All
eight Properties are leased to franchisees of national, regional and local fast food, family style and casual/theme restaurants. 

Original
lease terms for the leased Properties are generally five to 20 years from their inception. All leases are triple-net, which require the
tenant to pay all property operating costs including maintenance, repairs, utilities, property taxes, and insurance. All of the leases
contain percentage rent provisions, which require the tenant to pay a specified percentage (six percent to seven percent) of gross sales
above a threshold amount. None of the Properties are mortgaged. The Partnership owns the buildings and land, and all improvements for
all the Properties. The Partnership owned the following Properties as of March 1, 2023:

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements
are not historical facts but are the intent, belief or current expectations of the Partnership s management based on its knowledge
and understanding of the business and industry. Words such as may, anticipates, expects, intends, 
 plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, 
 should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations
will prove to have been correct. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 

Examples
of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding: 

our
 expectations regarding financial condition or results of operations in any future period; 

our
 future sources of, and needs for, liquidity and capital resources; 

our
 expectations regarding economic and business conditions (both nationally and where the Properties are located); 

our
 business strategies and our ability to grow our business; 

our
 decisions and policies with respect to the potential retention or disposition of one or more Properties; 

our
 ability to find a suitable purchaser for any marketed Properties; 

our
 ability to agree on an acceptable purchase price or contract terms for any Property sales; 

our
 ability to collect rents on our leases; 

our
 ability to maintain relationships with our tenants, and when necessary extend lease terms or identify new tenants; and 

our
 future capital expenditures. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Partnership s financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).
The preparation of these financial statements requires persons performing the functions of the Partnership s management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment. These estimates are based on
the General Partner s historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

The
Partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies pertain to: 

Depreciation
methods and lives - Depreciation of the properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings
and improvements. Additionally, the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance. As a result,
depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets. 

Revenue
recognition - Rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on the straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease
when collectability is reasonably assured. Percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated
in the lease and collectability is reasonably assured. 

10 

Impairment -The
Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets, primarily real estate, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnership s review involves comparing current and
future operating performance of the assets, the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows, to the carrying value
of the assets of the individual properties. Based on this analysis, if deemed necessary, a provision for possible loss is recognized. 

Investment
Properties 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Partnership owned eight Properties, all of which feature tenants that are franchisees of casual restaurants.
The following are operated at the aforementioned eight Properties: seven Wendy s restaurants, and an Applebee s restaurant.
The Properties are located in a total of three states. 

Property
taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Properties are the responsibility of the respective tenants. A more detailed
discussion of tax payments, insurance and ground rent is provided in Item 2, and incorporated herein by this reference. 

There
were no building improvements capitalized during 2022 or 2021. 

Further
Information 

A
summary of significant developments as of December 31, 2022, by Property, for Properties with such developments, can be found in Item
2, Properties. 

Net
Income 

Net
income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2,069,792 and 1,575,407, respectively. Net income per Limited Partner
Interest for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 44.28 and 33.70, respectively. 

Results
of Operations 

Net
income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2,069,792 and 1,575,407, respectively. See the paragraphs below for
further information as to variances in individual operating income and expense items. We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties,
other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable
or unfavorable, on Partnership revenues and investment property value. 

Fiscal
year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to fiscal year ended December 31, 2021: 

Operating
Rental Income: Operating rental income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 1.611 and 1.753 million, respectively.
The rental income was comprised of monthly lease obligations per the tenant leases and percentage rents obligations related to operating
tenants who had reached their sales breakpoint. The decrease in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to the lower base rental income and percentage
rent due to property sales in each of 2021 and 2022. 

11 

Management
expects total base operating rental income to be approximately 1,241,280 for the 2023 fiscal year based on operating leases currently
in place and does not include rents from properties held for sale. Future operating rental income has the potential to either decrease
or increase. Future operating rental income may decrease with a tenant default and/or we may reclassify certain additional properties
as properties held for sale. Future operating rental income may also increase with additional rents due from tenants, if those tenants
experience increased sales levels, which require the payment of additional rent to the Partnership. Operating percentage rents included
in operating rental income in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 342,359 and 388,701, respectively. However, the
2021 additional rent earned was reduced by a capital improvements rent credit to the tenant of the Folly Road Property, so, the actual
revenue earned from 2021 was 366,473, net of the 22,229 rent credit. Management expects percentage rents for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2023 to be about the same as those received in 2022 because the same strong sales performance from 2022 is expected again
in 2023. 

Partnership
Management Fees Expense: Partnership management fees expense for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 272,316
and 274,980, respectively. The General Partner receives a fee for managing the Partnership. See Note 5, Transactions with General Partner
and Its Affiliates, for further information. 

General
and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
 120,470 and 66,038, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city
registration and annual report filing fees, office supplies and printing costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage
and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees and state income tax expenses. Total operating
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were higher than in the fiscal year ended December
31, 2021, primarily due to about 50,000 in higher state income tax expense paid on behalf of the limited partners related to 2021
income. Management expects the total operating general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 to
be higher than for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 due to an expected increase in state income taxes due for 2022 income as
a result of the sale of the Walton Way property, and 2023 increased quarterly estimated state income tax payments. 

Professional
Services: Professional services expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 240,302 and 197,792, respectively.
Professional service expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, website design,
legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, electronic tax filings, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The General Partner
anticipates that total professional services expenses for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 will be about 90,000 lower than incurred
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The costs in 2023 are expected to decrease due to switching investor relations firms and
the related decrease in contract costs for the new investor relations services firm. 

Cash
Flow Analysis 

Net
cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 993,976 and 1,512,480, respectively.
Cash flows from operating activities was lower in 2022 primarily due to the increase in net income year over year offset by the gain
on the sale of the Walton Way property and the decrease in percentage rent receivable year over year. 

Depreciation
and amortization are non-cash items and do not affect the current operating cash flow of the Partnership or distributions to the limited
partners. 

Cash
flows provided from investing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1,448,425 and 584,379, respectively.
The 2022 amount is largely comprised of proceeds from the sale of the Walton Way property. The 2021 amount is comprised of proceeds from
the sale of the Martinez, GA property, offset by a leasing commission paid to the General Partner related to the six Wendy s leases
that were extended thru December 31, 2040 as of January 1, 2021. 

For
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, cash flows used in financing activities were 3,237,003 and consisted of aggregate limited partner
distributions of 3,225,000 and General Partner distributions of 12,003. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows used
in financing activities were 1,203,265 and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of 1,200,000 and General Partner distributions
of 3,265. Both limited partner and General Partner distributions have been, and will continue to be, made in accordance with the Partnership
Agreement. Management anticipates that aggregate limited partner distributions will be approximately 1,000,000 during 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Partnership s cash balance was 171,236 at December 31, 2022. Cash of approximately 38,709 is anticipated to be used in 2023 for
the payment of quarter-end accrued liabilities which are included in the balance sheet. 

12 

The
Partnership s principal demands for funds historically have been, and are expected to continue to be, for the payment of operating
expenses and distributions. Management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the Properties and potential sales of
Properties will primarily provide the sources for future liquidity and limited partner distributions. During the process of leasing the
Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other similarly situated properties. As a result,
in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, management may offer rental concessions, or other
inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnership s operations. The Partnership is also in competition
with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties. The two primary liquidity risks in the absence of
mortgage debt are the Partnership s inability to collect rent receivables and near- term or chronic property vacancies. The amount
of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the General Partner and is dependent on a number of factors, including
funds available for payment of distributions, capital expenditures, and taxable income recognition matching, which is primarily attributable
to percentage rents and property sales. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Properties were 100 leased. In addition, the Partnership collected 100 of its base rent due from
current operating tenants for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality
and stability. 

Seven
of the eight Properties are operated as Wendy s fast food restaurants and are franchises of the international Wendy s Company.
Operating base rents from these seven leases comprised approximately 89 of the total 2022 operating base rents included in operating
rental income of the Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2022, additional percentage rents totaled 342,359, 319,565 of
which were unbilled and were accrued in relation to the Properties operated as Wendy s restaurants. Therefore, during 2022, the
Partnership generated approximately 90 of its total operating revenues from those seven Properties. 

Since
the Properties are leased to restaurant tenants, the restaurant market is the major market segment with a material impact on Partnership
operations. The success of customer marketing and the operating effectiveness of the Partnership s lessees will impact the Partnership s
future operating success in a very competitive restaurant and food service marketplace. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. 

Disposition
Policies 

In
deciding whether to sell a Property, the General Partner considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation, market
and economic conditions and the general strength of the real estate market, cash flow and federal income tax considerations, including
possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the limited partners. The General Partner may exercise its discretion as to whether
and when to sell a Property, and there is no obligation to sell any of the Properties at any particular time, except upon Partnership
dissolution currently scheduled for November 30, 2023 pursuant to the Partnership Agreement. 

Inflation 

To
the extent that tenants can pass through commodity inflation in their sales prices, the Partnership will benefit from additional percentage
rent from increased sales. The majority of the Partnership s leases have percentage rental clauses. Revenues from operating percentage
rentals represented 21 of operating rental income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. If, however, inflation causes
sales to decrease, operating margins to deteriorate for lessees, or if expenses grow faster than revenues, then, inflation may well negatively
impact the portfolio through tenant defaults. 

Due
to the triple-net nature of the property leases, asset values generally move inversely with interest rates.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Partners 

 of
DiVall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of DiVall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership (the Partnership) as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, partners capital and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022 and the related
notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

, representing aggregate
capital contributions of by the former general partners and by the initial Limited Partner. A subsequent offering of limited

sold in that offering, resulting in total proceeds to the Partnership, net of underwriting compensation and other offering costs, of

The
Partnership is currently engaged in the business of owning and operating its investment portfolio of commercial real estate properties
(the Properties ). The Properties are leased on a triple net basis to, and operated by, franchisors or franchisees of national,
regional, and local retail chains under primarily long-term leases. The lessees are fast food, family style, and casual/theme restaurants.
As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership owned Properties, which are located in a total of states. 

The
Partnership is scheduled to be dissolved on November 30, 2023, or earlier upon the prior occurrence of any of the following events: (a)
the disposition of all its Properties; (b) the written determination by the General Partner, that the Partnership s assets may
constitute plan assets for purposes of ERISA; (c) the agreement of limited partners owning a majority of the outstanding
limited partner interests to dissolve the Partnership; or (d) the dissolution, bankruptcy, death, withdrawal, or incapacity of the last
remaining General Partner, unless an additional General Partner is elected previously by a majority of the limited partners. During the
second and third quarters of the nine odd numbered years from 2001 through 2017, consent solicitations were circulated to the Partnership s
limited partners which, if approved by the limited partners, would have authorized the General Partner to initiate the potential sale
of all of the Properties and the dissolution of the Partnership (each a Consent ). Limited partners owning a majority of
the outstanding Interests did not vote in favor of any of the Consents. Therefore, the Partnership continues to operate as a going concern. 

During
the 2020 consent solicitation process, the Limited Partners approved two separate amendments to the Partnership Agreement. The amendments
served to: (i) extend the term of the Partnership by three (3) years to November 30, 2023, and (ii) permit the General Partner to effect
distributions at times that it deems appropriate, but no less often than semi-annually.

years from their inception. The leases generally provide
for minimum rents and additional rents based upon percentages of gross sales in excess of specified breakpoints. The lessee is responsible
for occupancy costs such as maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and utilities. Accordingly, these amounts are not reflected in
the statements of income except in circumstances where, in the General Partner s opinion, the Partnership will be required to pay
such costs to preserve its assets (i.e., payment of past-due real estate taxes). Management has determined that the leases are properly
classified as operating leases; therefore, rental income is reported when earned on a straight-line basis and the cost of the property,

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 regarding ASC Topic 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard was developed to enable financial statement users to better understand the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The update s core principle is
that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Entities are to use a five-step
contract review model to ensure revenue is recognized, measured and disclosed in accordance with this principle. Those steps include
the following: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine
the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue
when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
Partnership is not subject to federal income tax because its income and losses are includable in the tax returns of its partners but
may be subject to certain state taxes. FASB has provided guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, disclosed
and presented in the financial statements. This requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course
of preparing the entity s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained when challenged
or when examined by the applicable taxing authority. Management has determined that there were no material uncertain income tax positions.
Tax returns filed by the Partnership generally are subject to examination by U.S. and state taxing authorities for the years ended after

indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnership s review involves comparing current and

per the Partnership Agreement, it has been the consistent practice of the Partnership to compensate the General Partner G.P. for leasing and property sales commissions. To the extent a particular property is sold, any unamortized leasing commissions earned previously

and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15I under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), and, based
upon that evaluation, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The General Partner, through its management, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for performing an assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management of the General Partner; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. 

Management
of the General Partner performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022 based upon criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO ). Based on our assessment, management of the General Partner determined that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the COSO.

Item
10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant 

The
Partnership itself does not have any employees, executive officers or directors and, therefore, has no board committees. 

The
General Partner of the Partnership is TPG. TPG s principal office is located at 1900 W 75 th Street, Suite 100, Prairie
Village, Kansas 66208. TPG was elected General Partner by vote of the Limited Partners effective on May 26, 1993. Prior to such date,
TPG had been managing the Partnership since February 8, 1993, under the terms of the PMA, which remains in effect. See Items 1 and 13
hereof for additional information about the PMA and the election of TPG as General Partner. 

The
executive officer and director of the General Partner who controls the affairs of the Partnership is: 

Bruce
A. Provo, Age 72 - President, Founder and Director, TPG. 

Mr.
Provo has been involved in the management of real estate and other asset portfolios since 1979. TPG was founded by Mr. Provo in 1985
and he has served as its President since its formation. TPG s focus has been to provide professional real estate services to outside
clients. Since the founding of TPG in 1985, Mr. Provo has also founded various entities engaged in unique businesses such as Rescue Services,
Owner Representation, Asset Management, Managed Financial and Accounting Systems, Investments, and Virtual Resort Services. The entities
are generally grouped under an informal umbrella known as The Provo Group of Companies. Since TPG was appointed General Partner to the
Partnership in 1993, Mr. Provo has been primarily responsible for making management, leasing and disposition decisions on behalf of the
Partnership. 

From
1982 to 1986, Mr. Provo also served as President and Chief Operating Officer of the North Kansas City Development Company NKCDC ),
North Kansas City, Missouri. NKCDC was founded in 1903 and the assets of the company were sold in December 1985 for 102,500,000. NKCDC
owned commercial and industrial properties, including an office park and a retail district, as well as apartment complexes, motels, recreational
facilities, fast food restaurants, and other properties. NKCDC s holdings consisted of over 100 separate properties and constituted
approximately 20 of the privately held real property in North Kansas City, Missouri (a four-square mile municipality). Following the
sale of the company s real estate, Mr. Provo served as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Liquidating Trustee of NKCDC
from 1986 to 1991. 

Mr.
Provo graduated from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio in 1972 with a B.S. in Accounting. He became a Certified Public Accountant in 1974
and was a manager in the banking and financial services division of Arthur Andersen LLP prior to joining Rubloff Development Corporation
in 1979. From 1979 through 1985, Mr. Provo served as Vice President - Finance and then as President of Rubloff Development Corporation. 

The
members of the Advisory Board of the Partnership are identified below. The Advisory Board provides guidance to management of the Partnership;
however, it does not have the express power or authority to oversee and direct the operations of the Partnership and its members are
not deemed Directors or Executive Officers of the Partnership. 

Jesse
Small CPA. Mr. Small has been a tax and business consultant in Hallandale, FL for more than 30 years. Mr. Small has a
Master s Degree in Economics. Mr. Small is a Limited Partner, and the Partnership believes that as an Advisory Board member, he
generally represents the views of Limited Partners. During the past five years after retiring from the accounting profession, Mr. Small
has been developing property on the east and west coast of Florida. 

Albert
Kramer - Retired. Mr. Kramer is now retired, but previously worked as Tax Litigation Manager for Phillips Petroleum Company,
now known as ConocoPhillips. His education includes undergraduate and MBA degrees from Harvard and a J.D. Degree from South Texas College
of Law. Mr. Kramer is a Limited Partner, and the Partnership believes that as an Advisory Board member he generally represents the views
of Limited Partners. 

29 

Code
of Ethics 

The
Partnership has no executive officers or any employees and, accordingly, has not adopted a formal code of ethics. 

Mr.
Provo and TPG require that all personnel, including all employees, officers and directors of TPG: engage in honest and ethical conduct;
ensure full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure; comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;
and report to Mr. Provo any deviation from these principles. Because TPG has two employees (including Mr. Provo), and because Mr. Provo
is the ultimate decision maker in all instances, TPG has not adopted a formal code of ethics. Mr. Provo, as Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the Board of Directors of TPG, negotiates and resolves all conflicts to the best of his ability and determines appropriate
actions if necessary to deter violations and promote accountability, consistent with his fiduciary obligations to TPG and the fiduciary
obligations of TPG to the Partnership. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires persons performing the functions of directors, executive officers, and persons who beneficially own
more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of
changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent
stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

To
our knowledge, based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us under Rule 16I (e) during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Forms 5 and any amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, and the representations made by the reporting persons to us, we believe that during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, our executive officers and directors and all persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our
equity securities complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation 

The
Partnership has not paid any executive compensation to the General Partner or to the directors and officers of the General Partner. The
person that performs the role of principal financial officer of the Partnership is a consultant to the General Partner and receives fees
from the General Partner (but not directly from the Partnership) pursuant to that relationship. The General Partner s participation
in the income of the Partnership is set forth in the Partnership Agreement, as amended. The General Partner received management fees
and expense reimbursements during the year. 

See
Item 13, below, and Note 5 to the Financial Statements in Item 8 hereof for further discussion of payments by the Partnership to the
General Partner and the former general partners. The principal executive officer of the General Partner is not directly compensated by
the Partnership for controlling the affairs of the Partnership.

(c)
Management knows of no contractual arrangements, the operation or the terms of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control
of the Partnership, except for provisions in the PMA. 

30 

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence 

Pursuant
to the terms of the PMA, the General Partner receives a Base Fee for managing the Partnership equal to four percent of gross receipts,
subject to a 159,000 minimum, annually. The PMA also provides that the Partnership is responsible for reimbursement for office rent
and related office overhead Expenses up to a maximum of 13,250 annually. Both the Base Fee and Expense reimbursement
are subject to annual Consumer Price Index based adjustments. Effective March 1, 2021, Management has elected to roll back the last five
years of CPI increases to their 2016 level and suspend any future CPI adjustments. Therefore, as of March 1, 2021, the minimum annual
Base Fee paid by the Partnership was decreased to 272,316 and the maximum annual Expenses reimbursement remained at 23,256. 

Additionally,
TPG, or its affiliates, are allowed up to one-half of the commissions customarily charged by other brokers in arm s-length sales
transactions involving comparable properties in the same geographic area, but such TPG commissions are not to exceed three percent of
the contract price on the sale of an investment property. The payment of a portion of such fees is subordinated to TPG s success
at recovering the funds misappropriated by the former general partners. See Note 7 to the financial statements for further information. 

The
PMA had an original expiration date of December 31, 2002. The term of the PMA has been extended multiple times and is currently set to
expire on December 31, 2024. The PMA can be terminated earlier (a) by a vote at any time by a majority in interest of the Limited Partners,
(b) upon the dissolution and winding up of the Partnership, (c) upon the entry of an order of a court finding that TPG has engaged in
fraud or other like misconduct or has shown itself to be incompetent in carrying out its duties under the Partnership Agreement, or (d)
upon sixty (60) days written notice from TPG to the Limited Partners of the Partnership. Upon termination of the PMA, other than by the
voluntary action of TPG, TPG will be paid a termination fee of one month s Base Fee allocable to the Partnership, subject to a
minimum of 13,250. In the event that TPG is terminated by action of a substitute general partner, TPG shall also receive, as part of
this termination fee, 4 of any proceeds recovered with respect to the obligations of the former general partners, whenever such proceeds
are collected. 

Under
the PMA, TPG will be indemnified by the Partnership, DiVall and Magnuson, and their controlled affiliates, and held harmless from all
claims of any party to the Partnership Agreement and from any third party including, without limitation, the Limited Partners of the
Partnership, for any and all liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising from or related
to claims relating to or arising from the PMA or its status as Permanent Manager. The indemnification does not extend to claims arising
from fraud or criminal misconduct of TPG as established by court findings. To the extent possible, the Partnership is to provide TPG
with appropriate errors and omissions, officer s liability or similar insurance coverage, at no cost to TPG. In addition, TPG was
granted the right to establish an Indemnification Trust in an original amount, not to exceed 250,000, solely for the purpose of funding
such indemnification obligations. Once a determination has been made that no such claims can or will be made against TPG, the balance
of the Trust will become unrestricted property of the Partnership. The corpus of the Trust has been fully funded with Partnership assets. 

Advisory
Board Member Independence 

Although
not directors or officers of the Partnership, the Partnership does evaluate whether the members of the Advisory
Board are independent by evaluating whether each member has any relationships or has engaged in any transactions that,
in the opinion of the General Partner, would interfere with any Advisory Board member s exercise of independent judgment with respect
to matters concerning the Partnership. As a part of this evaluation the General Partner considers, among other things, transactions and
relationships between any member of the Advisory Board or any member of his family and the Partnership. The General Partner believes
that each of Messrs. Small and Kramer are independent .

DESCRIPTION
OF DIVALL INSURED INCOME PROPERTIES 2 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP S 

 SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF 

 THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 

DiVall
Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership, a Wisconsin limited partnership DiVall or the Partnership ),
has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: limited partnership interests
in the Partnership Units ). 

The
following is a summary of the rights of the holders of Units. This summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
entirety by, the related provisions of the Agreement of Limited Partnership dated November 25, 1987, as amended from time to time (the
 Partnership Agreement ), which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which
this Exhibit 4.1 is an exhibit; and applicable Wisconsin law, including the Wisconsin Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Partnership Agreement. 

Limited
Partnership Interests 

Units
represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership that entitle the holders thereof to the rights and privileges specified to
Limited Partners in our Partnership Agreement, including the right to participate in distributions. The Units are registered pursuant
to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of December 31, 2022, there were 46,280.3 Units issued and outstanding
held by 1,125 Limited Partners of record. The Partnership has no other class of securities authorized or outstanding. The Units are not
listed for trading on any exchange. 

Distributions
to Partners; Allocations 

The
Partnership Agreement provides for net income and loss of the Partnership to be allocated on a quarterly basis, 99 to the Limited Partners
and 1 to the General Partner. 

The
Partnership Agreement provides for the distribution of net cash receipts and net proceeds to the limited partners and General Partner
at times that the General Partner deems appropriate, but no less often than semi-annually, subject to the limitations on distributions
Partner described in the Partnership Agreement. In general, distributions from Net Proceeds (as defined) are distributed first to the
Limited Partners in an amount equal to 100 of their Adjusted Original Capital, then an amount necessary to provide each Limited Partner
a liquidation preference from the Return Calculation Date (as defined) and giving effect to prior distributions of net cash receipts
and any distributions of Net Proceeds (except for distribution amounts deemed appropriate by the General Partner to pay its federal and
state income tax on the income allocated to the General Partner attributable to such year), and then 99 to the Limited Partners and
1 to the General Partner. 

Capital
Contributions 

Limited
Partners are not required to make additional capital contributions to the Partnership and are not subject to mandatory future capital
calls. 

General
Partner 

The
Provo Group, Inc. (the General Partner ), is the general partner of the Partnership. The General Partner has
broad discretion to manage the Partnership and its affairs, including to cause the Partnership to acquire interests in real property
assets, manage and operate Partnership properties, sell, lease and dispose of Partnership properties, borrow funds from financial institutions
on behalf of the Partnership, make tax elections, and admit additional Limited Partners. The Partnership Agreement imposes certain restrictions
on the General Partner with respect to the operation of the Partnership, including restrictions on causing the Partnership to engage
in certain transactions with the General Partner or its affiliates or to receive loans from the Partnership. In addition, the Partnership
Agreement imposes various affirmative duties on the General Partner. The General Partner is not required to manage the Partnership as
its sole and exclusive function and is permitted to have other business interests and may engage in other activities to those relating
to the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement provides, subject to certain requirements that the General Partner may be due certain fees,
such as a disposition fee upon the sale of Partnership properties. The General Partner is indemnified from any claims or expenses arising
out of, or relating to, serving as the General Partner, so long as such claims do not arise from fraudulent or criminal misconduct by
the General Partner. 

In
addition to the General Partner, the Partnership Agreement provides for an advisory committee with that committee to review and advise
on matters such as operational policies and practices of the Partnership, extraordinary transactions, transactions that may be present
a conflict of interest, any compensation due the General Partner and to serve as the equivalent of an audit committee. 

Voting
Rights 

Subject
to certain limitations and requirements in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has the sole and exclusive right and power
to manage and operate the business of the Partnership. However, the Units entitle the holder to vote on all matters submitted to a vote
of Unit Holders. The Partnership Agreement provides Limited Partners with certain limited voting rights. For example, the Limited Partners,
by a vote of Limited Partners holding a majority of the then outstanding Units, are required to approve certain actions, such as: the
removal of the General Partner or the admission of a new General Partner; the extension of the Partnership s term; the dissolution
of the Partnership; subject to certain limitations, amendments to the Partnership Agreement; the sale of all or substantially all of
the Partnership s assets; and certain transactions the Partnership may seek to engage in or effect. 

No
Withdrawal or Dissolution; Restrictions on Transfer 

No
Limited Partner may at any time withdraw from the Partnership, except as provided in the Partnership Agreement, and no Limited Partner
currently has the right to have the Partnership dissolved or the right to a return of any contribution to the capital of the Partnership. 

The
Partnership Agreement imposes various restrictions and requirements on a Limited Partner s right to sell, transfer or assign their
Units. Among the restrictions is that any proposed transfer must be effected in accordance with limitations that will not result in the
termination of the Partnership under the Internal Revenue Code. 

Term 

The
Partnership Agreement currently provides the term of the Partnership extends until November 30, 2023.
