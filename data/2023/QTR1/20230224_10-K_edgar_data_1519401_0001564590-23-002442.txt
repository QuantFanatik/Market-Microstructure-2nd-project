Part I 

ITEM 1. 
 
 BUSINESS . 

 Overview 
 We are a diversified consumer finance company that provides installment loan products primarily to customers with limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrifts, credit card companies, and other lenders. As of December 31, 2022, we operated under the name Regional Finance online and in branch locations in 18 states across the United States, serving 517,700 active accounts. Most of our loan products are secured, and each is structured on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis with fully amortizing equal monthly installment payments, repayable at any time without penalty. We source our loans through our omni-channel platform, which includes our branches, centrally-managed direct mail campaigns, digital partners, and consumer website. We operate an integrated branch model in which nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branch network with the support of centralized sales, underwriting, service, collections, and administrative teams. This provides us with frequent in-person contact with our customers, which we believe improves our credit performance and customer loyalty. Our goal is to consistently grow our finance receivables and to soundly manage our portfolio risk, while providing our customers with attractive and easy-to-understand loan products that serve their varied financial needs. 
 Our core products are small and large installment loans. As a complement to our loan products, we offer our customers optional payment and collateral protection insurance. 

Small Loans We offer small installment loans with cash proceeds to customers ranging from 500 to 2,500, with terms of up to 48 months. Our small loans are typically secured by non-essential household goods and/or, to a lesser extent, a lien on a vehicle, which may be an automobile, motorcycle, boat, or all-terrain vehicle. As of December 31, 2022, we had 287,000 small loans outstanding representing 481.6 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately 1,700 per loan. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, interest and fee income from small loans contributed 160.4 million, 150.6 million, and 151.5 million, respectively, to our total revenue. 

Large Loans We offer large installment loans with cash proceeds to customers ranging from 2,501 to 25,000, with terms between 18 and 60 months. Our large loans are typically secured by non-essential household goods and/or a vehicle. As of December 31, 2022, we had 225,600 large loans outstanding representing 1.2 billion in finance receivables, or an average of approximately 5,400 per loan. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, interest and fee income from large loans contributed 288.5 million, 229.9 million, and 180.3 million, respectively, to our total revenue. 

Optional Payment and Collateral Protection Insurance Products We offer our customers optional payment and collateral protection insurance relating to our loan products, including credit life insurance, accident and health insurance, involuntary unemployment insurance, and personal property insurance. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, insurance income, net contributed 43.5 million, 35.5 million, and 28.3 million, respectively, to our total revenue. 

 Through November 2022, we also offered indirect retail installment loans of up to 7,500. We ceased offering indirect retail installment loans in November 2022 to focus on growing our core loan portfolio, but we continue to own and service the loans that we previously originated. As of December 31, 2022, we had 5,100 retail loans outstanding representing 9.6 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately 1,900 per loan. 
 Industry, Customers, and Purpose 
 We operate in the consumer finance industry, in which consumers are generally described as super-prime (most creditworthy), prime, near-prime, non-prime, subprime, or deep-subprime (least creditworthy). Our customers typically have less-than-perfect credit profiles and, for that reason, are generally considered subprime, non-prime, or near-prime consumers. As a result, our customers often do not qualify for prime financing from banks, thrifts, credit card providers, and other lenders. However, like prime consumers, our customers have a need and a desire to utilize credit. 
 Notwithstanding that many lenders are unwilling to serve our customers, we believe that responsible, transparent, and fairly priced credit products should be made available to our customers. We exist to serve that purpose, and accordingly, we offer our customers access to credit through our affordable, easy-to-understand small and large loan products, which we price on fair terms in consideration of the associated credit risk and servicing costs. 
 The average annual percentage rate APR of our small loans originated in 2022 was 42.7 . Our large loans, which are reserved for higher credit quality customers who meet more stringent underwriting requirements than those applied to small loan applicants, had an average APR of 29.5 for loans originated in 2022. We believe that the rates on our products are significantly more attractive than many other credit options available to our customers, such as payday, pawn, and title loans, which often come 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 2 

with APRs over 300 . Our loans are also safer and more favorably structured than loans offered by alternative financial service providers. We underwrite our loans based on an applicant s ability to repay, whereas payday, pawn, and title loans are typically underwritten based on an ability to collect, either through access to the borrower s bank account or by repossession and sale of collateral. We also structure our loans on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis with fully amortizing, equal monthly installment payments that are designed to be affordable for our customers and made over an average term of 22 months and 46 months for small and l arge loans , respectively for loans originated in 2022 ). By comparison, payday, pawn, and title loans typically have balloon payments following short terms of 14 to 60 days. 
 Importantly, we further differentiate ourselves from alternative financial service providers by reporting our customers payment performance to credit bureaus. This practice provides our customers with the opportunity to improve their credit profile by establishing a responsible payment history with us and, ultimately, to gain access to a wider range of credit options, including our own. For example, in 2022, we worked with many of our deserving customers to refinance nearly 35,000 of our customers small loans into large loans, representing 203.4 million in finance receivables at origination, and resulting in a decrease in these customers average APR from 42.2 to 30.2 . We also believe that, over time, many of our customers transition away from our company to prime sources of credit. 
 Our diversity of loan products with competitive, safe, and transparent pricing and terms, combined with the opportunity for our customers to improve their credit history and profile, distinguishes us in the consumer finance market, provides us with a competitive advantage, and allows us to serve an important purpose that is mutually beneficial to our customers, communities, employees, and stockholders. 
 Business Model 
 Omni-Channel Platform. Our omni-channel platform, which includes our branches, direct mail campaigns, digital partners, and consumer website, enables us to offer a range of loan products to new, existing, and former customers throughout our markets. We began building our branch network over 30 years ago and have expanded the network to 345 branches in 18 states as of December 31, 2022. Our branch personnel market our products in a number of ways, including through a merchant referral program, customer referrals, direct telephone and mail solicitations of current and former customers, and by leveraging our direct mail program and leads generated by our digital affiliates and consumer website. Our direct mail campaigns include mailings of pre-screened convenience checks, pre-qualified offers, and invitations to apply, which enable us to market our products to millions of current and potential customers in a cost-effective manner. We have also developed our consumer website and partnered with digital lead generation sources to promote our products and facilitate loan applications via the internet. We believe that our omni-channel platform provides us with a competitive advantage by giving us broad access to our existing and former customers and multiple avenues to attract new customers. 
 Attractive Products for Customers with Limited Access to Credit. Our flexible loan products, generally ranging from 500 to 25,000 with terms of up to 60 months, are competitively priced, easy to understand, and incorporate features designed to meet the varied financial needs and credit profiles of a broad range of consumers. This product diversity distinguishes us from monoline competitors and provides us with the ability to offer our customers new loan products as their credit profiles evolve, building customer loyalty and increasing the overall value of customer relationships. 
 Integrated Branch Model with Centralized Support. Our branch network serves as the foundation of our omni-channel platform and the primary point of contact with our customers. Over 72 of our loan originations in 2022 were facilitated by one of our branch locations, and nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branches, allowing us to maintain frequent, in-person contact with our customers. By integrating loan origination and loan servicing at the branch level, our employees are able to maintain a relationship with our customers throughout the life of a loan. We believe this frequent-contact, relationship-driven lending model provides greater insight into potential payment difficulties, reduces credit risk, and allows us to assess the borrowing needs of our customers, better enabling us to offer them new loan products as their credit profiles and needs evolve. In recent years, we have provided our branch network with increasing levels of centralized sales, underwriting, service, collections, and administrative support, and we plan to continue our investment in and testing of centralized support in the future. 
 Consistent Portfolio Performance. Over the past several years, we have maintained a sharp focus on credit quality by investing in highly qualified personnel, refining underwriting practices, developing custom credit scorecards, streamlining procedures, automating underwriting decisions, and improving reporting capabilities. These investments allow us to control the credit quality of our portfolio, maintain compliance with evolving state and federal law, and react quickly whenever market dynamics may change. We have also expanded our centralized collections department and provided our branches with improved collections tools, training, and incentives. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 3 

Demonstrated Organic Growth. We have grown our total finance receivables by 103.8 , from 834.0 million at December 31, 201 7 to 1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 , a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 15.3 . More importantly, we have grown our core small loan and large loan finance receivables by 128.5 , from 739.4 million at December 31, 201 7 to 1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 , a CAGR of 18.0 . This receivables growth has driven a revenue increase of 86.2 , from 272.5 million in 201 7 to 507.2 million in 2022 , a CAGR of 13.2 . Our portfolio growth has come from expanding our geographic presence , growing our finance receivable portfolios within existing branches, and developing new products and channels, including through digital lead generation. Between 201 8 and 2022 , we entered nine new states, and since 2020, we have introduced new technologies and marketing strategies to enable remote loan closings and to extend the geographic reach of our branches . Historically, our branches have rapidly increased their outstanding finance receivables during the early years of operations and generally achieved profitability within one year of opening. 
 Experienced Management Team. Our executive and senior operations management teams consist of individuals experienced in installment lending and other consumer finance services. Our Chief Executive Officer has over 30 years of experience in consumer financial services, our Chief Operating Officer has over 35 years of experience in consumer financial services, our Chief Financial Officer has over 20 years of financial services experience, and our Chief Credit Risk Officer has 20 years of financial and consumer lending experience. As of December 31, 2022, our state operations vice presidents averaged nearly 26 years of industry experience and 11 years of service at Regional, while our associate vice presidents and district supervisors averaged nearly 23 years of industry experience and 8 years of service with Regional. Our executive and senior operations management team members intend to leverage their experience and expertise in consumer lending to grow our business, deliver high-quality service to our customers, and carefully manage our credit risk. 
 Strategies 
 Expand Our Geographic Presence. We expect to continue to grow the receivables, revenue, and profitability of our existing branches, to open new branches within our existing geographic footprint, and to expand our operations into new states. Establishing local contact with our customers through our branch network is a key to our frequent-contact, relationship-driven lending model. We believe that there remains substantial opportunity to grow the finance receivable portfolios of our existing branches by continuing our focus on large loan originations and by cross-selling new loan products to our existing customers. During 2022, we expanded into Mississippi, Indiana, California, Louisiana, and Idaho. We anticipate that as our newer branches mature, their revenue will grow faster than our overall same-store revenue growth rate. We believe there is sufficient demand for consumer finance services to continue new branch openings in certain of the states where we currently operate, allowing us to capitalize on our existing infrastructure and experience in these markets. We also intend to explore opportunities for growth in states outside of our existing geographic footprint that enjoy favorable operating environments. We plan to expand our operations to one or two additional states by the end of 2023, and over time, we expect to have a national presence. 
 Leverage Direct Mail Marketing. Direct mail campaigns are launched throughout the year but are weighted to coincide with seasonal consumer demand. In addition, we mail convenience checks in new markets as soon as new branches are open, which develops a customer base and builds finance receivables for these new branches. We plan to continue to invest in and to improve the targeting criteria, offer strategies, and testing protocols of our direct mail campaigns, which we believe will enable us to efficiently grow our receivables with improved credit performance. We expect that these efforts will allow us to increase volume at our branches by adding new customers, recapturing former customers, and creating opportunities to offer new loan products to our existing customers. 
 Improve Our Digital Capabilities. In order to better attract and serve customers who prefer to conduct business digitally, we make an online loan application available on our consumer website, generate customer leads through digital partners, and provide our customers with online account management capabilities. Over the past few years, we have invested heavily in our digital acquisition channel and servicing tools. For example, we rolled out an improved digital prequalification experience for our customers, including expanded integrations with existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators. We also began testing a digital origination product and channel for new customers, through which new loans can be fulfilled entirely online without intervention by our personnel, and we launched an enhanced customer portal. These efforts enabled us to grow new digitally sourced volumes as a percentage of total new customer volumes to nearly 30 in 2022, compared to 27 in 2021. In the future, we will continue our focus on the digital channel. We plan to expand the testing of our digital origination product and channel to new geographies and improve the customer experience. We also expect to complete the development of our mobile app and further enhancements to our customer portal, allowing our customers easy access to payment functionality and additional features. Our investment in our digital channel allows us to add capabilities, improve efficiencies, enhance the customer experience, and test new mechanisms for lead generation to diversify and expand our new business acquisition opportunities. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 4 

Enhance Our Products, Channels, and Services . Over time, w e intend to improve our existing product offerings, to introduce new products and services, and to capture customers through new channels and partnerships. For example, in 2020, we introduced an enhanced auto-secured large loan product, through which we offer larger auto-secured loans to some of our highest credit quality customers. As of the end of 2022, this product exceeded 100 million in total portfolio. In the future, we will continue to assess new credit and non-credit products and services and expand the channels and partnerships through which we acquire customers. 
 Maintain Sound Underwriting and Credit Control. We have invested heavily in our credit and collections functions. We plan to continue to do so in the future by maintaining highly qualified employees dedicated to managing credit risk, refining our underwriting models, and improving our collection efforts through both our branch operations and our centralized collections department. In early 2018, we completed the implementation of our new loan origination and servicing software platform, which allows us to automate our underwriting decisions, among other benefits. In addition, we began to integrate custom credit models into our automated underwriting processes during the second half of 2018. We completed the rollout of our custom credit models to all of our states in 2019 and began seeing the impact in our results in late 2019. In 2022, we introduced our next generation custom credit model, a new proprietary model that we expect will provide significant advancements in underwriting capabilities by utilizing sophisticated modeling algorithms that leverage new alternative data sources to drive more predictable outcomes and make better credit decisions at the margin. Through these efforts and others, we plan to continue to carefully manage our credit exposure as we grow our business, offer new products, access new channels, and enter new markets. 
 Carefully Manage Our G&A Expenses. We have made significant investments in our business over the past several years, including by increasing our marketing spend to drive new business, expanding our branch network, hiring operations employees to service our growing finance receivable portfolio, and improving our credit, information technology, and data and analytics capabilities. However, during that time, we also remained keenly focused on driving operating leverage through the prudent management of our expenses. Between 2018 and 2022, our operating expense ratio (annualized general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average net finance receivables) decreased from 16.1 to 14.5 . As we grow our business, we will remain vigilant in our management of general and administrative expenses , with the goal of decreasing such expenses as a percentage of average net finance receivables over time. 
 Loan Products 
 We offer small and large installment loans to our customers. Our underwriting standards focus on our customers ability to affordably make loan payments out of their discretionary income, with the value of pledged collateral serving as a credit enhancement rather than the primary underwriting criterion. The interest rates, fees and other charges, maximum principal amounts, and maturities for our loans vary from state to state, depending on the competitive environment and relevant laws and regulations. 
 Small and large loans are originated by our branch network, by our centralized sales and service team, digitally through our consumer website, or through our convenience check direct mail campaigns. Our convenience check direct mail loan offers enable prospective customers to enter into a loan with us by cashing or depositing the check attached to the loan offer, thereby agreeing to the terms of the loan as prominently set forth on the check and accompanying disclosures. When a customer enters into a loan by cashing or depositing the convenience check, our personnel gather additional information on the borrower to assist in servicing the loan. 
 For loans originated by our branch network or centralized sales and service team, we consider numerous factors in evaluating a potential customer s creditworthiness, such as unencumbered income, debt-to-income ratio, length of current employment, duration of residence, and a credit report detailing the applicant s credit history. Our loan origination and servicing software platform guides our branch personnel through the credit application process and automates much of the underwriting, with underwriting exceptions generally subject to review and approval by a senior operations or centralized underwriting team member. For convenience check loans, each prospect that we solicit has been pre-screened through a major credit bureau against our underwriting criteria, which includes an evaluation of the recipient s credit score, bankruptcy history, and a number of additional credit attributes relevant to the recipient s likely ability and willingness to repay the offered convenience check loan. 
 Loan renewals are also an important part of our business. Our customers use renewals to extend and expand their lending relationships with us. We generally offer loan renewals to existing customers who have demonstrated an ability and willingness to repay amounts owed to us. Renewals typically refinance one or more of a customer s loans into a single new loan, which in some cases will be for a larger principal balance than the customer s original loan, though we permit renewals of existing loans at or below the original loan amount. In evaluating a loan for renewal, in addition to our standard underwriting requirements, we are able to 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 5 

take into consideration the customer s prior payment performance with us, which we believe is a very strong indicator of the customer s future credit performance . 
 Small Loans. In 2022, the average originated principal balance and term for our small loans were 2,069 and 22 months, respectively.

Insurance and Ancillary Products 
 We also offer our customers various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products as a complement to our lending operations. Our primary insurance products include optional credit life insurance, accident and health insurance, involuntary 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 6 

unemployment insurance, and personal property insurance. These insurance products are optional and not a condition of the loan, and we do not sell insurance to non-borrowers. Our insurance products, including the types of products offered and their terms and conditions, vary from state to state in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Insurance policy premiums, claims, an d expenses are included in our results of operations as insurance income, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In 2022 , insurance income, net was 43.5 million , or 8. 6 of our total revenue. 
 Credit life insurance provides for the payment in full of the borrower s credit obligation to the lender in the event of the borrower s death and, in some states, may provide a payment to a secondary beneficiary listed by the borrower. Credit accident and health insurance provides for the repayment of certain loan installments to the lender that come due during an insured s period of income interruption resulting from disability from illness or injury. Credit involuntary unemployment insurance provides for repayment of certain loan installments in the event that the borrower is no longer employed as the result of a qualifying event, such as a layoff or reduction in workforce. Credit personal property insurance provides for payment following accidental loss of, or damage to, personal property collateral resulting from certain casualty events. We require that customers maintain property insurance on any personal property securing loans and offer customers the option of providing proof of such insurance purchased from a third party (such as homeowners or renters insurance) in lieu of purchasing property insurance from us. We also require proof of insurance on any vehicles securing loans, and in select markets, we offer vehicle single interest insurance on vehicles used as collateral on small and large loans. 
 All customers purchasing these types of insurance from us are required to sign multiple statements affirming that they understand that their purchase of insurance is optional and not a condition of the loan. In addition, a customer may cancel purchased insurance at any time during the life of the loan, including in connection with an early payoff or loan refinancing. Customers who cancel within thirty (30) days of the date of purchase receive a full refund of the insurance premium, and customers who cancel thereafter receive a refund of the unearned portion of the insurance premium. 
 Apart from the various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products that we offer to our customers, on certain loans, we also collect a fee from our customers and, in turn, purchase non-file insurance from an unaffiliated insurance company for our benefit in lieu of recording and perfecting our security interest in personal property collateral. Non-file insurance protects us from credit losses where, following an event of default, we are unable to take possession of personal property collateral because our security interest is not perfected (for example, in certain instances where a customer files for bankruptcy). In such circumstances, non-file insurance generally will pay to us an amount equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the collateral value, with such claims payment lowering our net credit losses. 
 We market and sell insurance policies as an agent of an unaffiliated insurance company, within the limitations established by our agency contracts with the unaffiliated insurance company. We then remit to the unaffiliated insurance company the premiums we collect, net of refunds on prepaid loans and net of commission on new business. The unaffiliated insurance company then cedes to our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., the net insurance premium revenue and the associated insurance claims liability for all insurance products, including the non-file insurance that we purchase. Life insurance premiums are ceded as written, and non-life insurance premiums are ceded as earned. In accepting the premium revenue and associated claims liability, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd. acts as reinsurer for all insurance products that we sell to our customers and for the non-file insurance that we purchase. RMC Reinsurance, Ltd. pays the unaffiliated insurance company a ceding fee for the continued administration of all insurance products. 
 In addition, in select states, we offer an Auto Plus Plan auto club product that is administered and serviced through a third-party provider. The product generally provides certain automobile, home, travel, and other services and benefits to customers, including emergency towing and roadside assistance, emergency locksmith service, automobile repair reimbursement, stolen car expense benefit, automobile insurance deductible reimbursement, limited legal services, and various travel and other discounts. The Auto Plus Plan is not an insurance product, and therefore, it is not included in our results of operations as insurance income, net, but rather, it is included as part of revenue under other income. However, as with the optional insurance products that we offer, any customer purchasing an Auto Plus Plan acknowledges that the purchase is optional and not a condition of the loan and that the plan may be cancelled within 30 days for a full refund. 
 Branch Network 
 Our branches are generally located in visible, high-traffic locations, such as shopping centers or, to a lesser extent, commercial office buildings. We believe that our branches have an open, welcoming, and hospitable layout. In evaluating whether to locate a branch in a particular community, we examine several factors, including the demonstrated demand for consumer finance, the regulatory and political climate, and the availability of suitable employees to staff, manage, and supervise the new branch.

Historically, net finance receivables per branch and average branch operating income contribution have increased as our branches mature. Beginning in 2021 with our expansion to Illinois, we began to implement a lighter branch footprint strategy, pursuant to which we are leveraging our new technology and digital capabilities to service a wider geographic area in new branch locations. As a result, our new branches opened in 2021 and 2022 have on average grown their net finance receivables and operating income contribution at a faster pace than branches opened prior to 2021. As a result of this strategy, the net finance receivables per branch and the average branch operating income contribution of branches open one to three years exceed that of branches open three to five years in the tables above. 
 We calculate the average branch contribution as total revenues generated by the branch less the expenses directly attributable to the branch, including the provision for losses and operating expenses, such as personnel, lease, and interest expenses. General corporate overhead, including management salaries, is not attributed to any individual branch. Accordingly, the sum of branch contributions from all of our branches is greater than our income before taxes. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,991 employees, including 1,603 employees on our field operations teams and 388 employees (including centralized customer service and collections staff) on our headquarters teams. All of our employees are located within the United States, and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We work diligently to attract the best talent in order to meet the current and future demands of our business, and we have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits, and development opportunities. In addition, to ensure that we provide a rewarding experience for our employees, we engage independent third parties to conduct periodic employee engagement surveys, enabling us to regularly measure organizational culture and engagement and to improve upon the employee experience, which in turn drives a superior customer experience. 
 We are also committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion DE&I ). We believe that the collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, self-expression, unique capabilities, and talent that our employees invest in their work represent a significant part of our culture, reputation, and achievement. We believe that an emphasis on DE&I drives value for our employees, customers, and stockholders, and that our DE&I commitment enables us to better serve our communities. In 2022, in furtherance of our DE&I objectives, we engaged a third-party consultant to complete a DE&I assessment and make recommendations as to how we can further promote DE&I within our organization. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 8 

We also offer our employees a variety of training and development opportunities. New employees complete a comprehensive training curriculum that focuses on the company- and position-specific competencies needed to be successful. The training includes a blended approach utilizing eLearning modules, hands-on exercises, webinars, and assessments. Training content is focused on our operating policies and procedures, as well as several key compliance areas. Incentive compensation for new employees is contingent upon the successful and timely completion of the required new hire training curriculum. All current employees are also required to complete annual compliance training and re-certification. Additional management and developmental training is provided for those employees seeking to advance within our company. 
 For additional information on the ways that we seek to empower our employees, please visit our corporate responsibility website at www.regionalfinance.com/corporate-responsibility . The information contained on our corporate responsibility website is not and should not be viewed as being incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Payment and Loan Servicing 
 We have implemented company-wide payment and loan servicing policies and procedures, which are designed to maintain consistent portfolio performance and to ensure regulatory compliance. Our district supervisors, associate vice presidents, state vice presidents, and compliance and internal audit teams regularly review servicing and collection records to ensure compliance with our policies and procedures. Our centralized management information system enables regular monitoring of branch portfolio metrics by management, and the compensation opportunities of our operations employees and senior management have a significant performance component that is closely tied to credit quality, among other defined performance targets. 
 The responsibility for the servicing and collection of each loan generally rests with the originating branch. Borrowers who have signed up for online account access have on-demand access to their account information through Regional s website. In addition, borrowers may elect to receive automated, one-way text messages with information regarding their account, including payment reminders. Borrowers have the option of making payments (i) in person at a branch where they may pay by cash, check, money order, debit card, or immediate, one-time future, or recurring ACH, (ii) through our customer portal via debit card or immediate, one-time future, or recurring ACH, or (iii) by immediate or one-time future debit card or ACH over the phone. In the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately 80 (by dollar amount) of customer payments were made by debit card or ACH. 
 If a loan becomes severely delinquent, a branch may receive co-collection assistance from our centralized servicing team or third-party collector. Our philosophy is to work with customers experiencing payment difficulties. If a customer is unable to make the required payments to bring his or her loan current, acceptable solutions to remedy a past due loan may include deferral of a payment, loan renewal, or settlement. All solutions are intended to enable the customer to meet his or her current and future obligations in a manner that we believe will mitigate our risk, while also complying with state and federal laws and regulations, as well as our policies and procedures. 
 Customers generally are limited to two deferrals of their monthly payment in a rolling twelve-month period unless it is determined that an exception is warranted (e.g . due to a natural disaster or pandemic). For example, since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily allowed up to three deferrals in a rolling twelve-month period. We generally limit the refinancing of delinquent loans to those customers who have made recent payments and for whom we have verified current employment, and we do not charge any origination fees on the refinancing of a severely delinquent loan. We believe that refinancing delinquent loans for certain deserving customers who have made periodic payments allows us to help customers resolve temporary financial setbacks and repair or sustain their credit. During 2022, we refinanced approximately 13.5 million of loans that were 60 or more days contractually past due, representing approximately 0.8 of our total loan originations in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of such refinanced loans was 11.2 million, or 0.7 of finance receivables as of such date. We may also agree to settle a past-due loan by accepting less than the full principal balance owed. A settlement is only used in certain limited cases and is only offered once we have determined that we are unlikely to collect the entire outstanding balance of the loan. 
 For seriously delinquent accounts, we may seek legal judgments or pursue repossession of collateral. We typically initiate repossession efforts only when we have exhausted other means of collection and, in the opinion of management, the customer is unlikely to make further payments. We sell substantially all repossessed collateral through sales conducted by independent auction organizations, after the required post-repossession waiting period. Generally, we charge off loans during the month that the loan becomes 180 days contractually delinquent. Accounts without a lien on a vehicle in a confirmed Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy are charged off at 60 days contractually delinquent, subject to certain exceptions. Deceased borrower accounts are charged off in the month following the proper notification of passing, with the exception of borrowers with credit life insurance. We sell most of our charged-off accounts to third-party debt buyers.

Information Technology 
 We utilize a loan origination and servicing platform offered by Nortridge Software, LLC Nortridge both to originate loans and to service our loan portfolio. We have invested in customizing the Nortridge platform to meet our needs based upon our specific products, processes, and reporting requirements. The Nortridge custom decision engine utilizes application information and a credit report detailing the applicant s credit history to generate an initial credit decision and to guide our branch employees through the loan origination process to the final credit decision. Throughout the life of the loan, our employees utilize Nortridge to, among other things, enter payments, generate collection queues, and log collection activity. Nortridge also facilitates electronic and recurring payments, automated text messaging, and customer account access through a customer portal. Nortridge logs and maintains, within our centralized information systems, a permanent record of the loan origination and servicing approvals and processes, and permits all levels of branch and centralized management to review the individual and collective performance of all branches for which they are responsible on a daily basis. We intend to continue to enhance the Nortridge platform to further leverage its capabilities and to meet our evolving needs. 
 Competition 
 The consumer finance industry is highly fragmented, with numerous competitors. We compete with several national companies operating greater than 300 branch locations each, a handful of smaller, regionally-focused companies with between 100 and 300 branches in certain of the states in which we operate, and many independent operators with fewer than 100 branches. We believe that competition between installment consumer loan companies occurs primarily on the basis of price, breadth of loan product offerings, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided. While underbanked customers may also use alternative financial services providers, such as title lenders, payday lenders, and pawn shops, these providers products offer different terms and typically carry substantially higher interest rates and fees than our installment loans. Accordingly, we believe that alternative financial services providers are not an attractive option for customers who meet our underwriting standards, which are generally stricter than the underwriting standards of alternative financial services providers. Our small and large loans also compete with pure online lenders, peer-to-peer lenders, and issuers of non-prime credit cards. 
 Seasonality 
 Our loan volume and contractual delinquency follow seasonal trends. Demand for our loans is typically highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which we believe is largely due to customers borrowing money for vacation, back-to-school, and holiday spending. Loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter, which we believe is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. Delinquencies generally reach their lowest point in the first half of the year and rise in the second half of the year. Changes in quarterly growth or liquidation could result in larger allowance for credit loss releases in periods of portfolio liquidation, and larger provisions for credit losses in periods of portfolio growth. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our operating results. However, changes in macroeconomic factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflict, have impacted our typical seasonal trends for loan volume and delinquency. 
 Government Regulation 
 Consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and ordinances. Many of these laws impose detailed constraints on how we originate loans, offer optional products, collect on debt, and otherwise operate our business. The software that we use to originate loans is designed in part to aid in compliance with all applicable lending laws and regulations. 
 State Lending Regulation. We are regulated by state agencies that regularly audit our branches and operations. In general, most state statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates, as well as the types and maximum amounts of fees and insurance premiums that we may charge for both direct and indirect lending. These specific allowable charges vary by state. In addition, state laws regulate the keeping of books and records and other aspects of the operation of consumer finance companies, and state and federal laws regulate account collection practices. State agency approval is required to open new branches, and each of our branches is separately licensed under the laws of the state in which the branch is located. Licenses granted by the regulatory agencies in these states are subject to annual renewal and revocation for failing to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. In the states in which we currently operate, licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing. We believe we are in compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to our lending operations in each state. 
 State Insurance Regulation. Premiums and charges for optional collateral and credit protection insurance products are set at or below authorized statutory rates and are stated separately in our disclosures to customers, as required by the Truth in Lending Act and by various applicable state laws. We are also subject to state laws and regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which we sell insurance. State insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed and limit the premium amount 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 10 

charged for such insurance. Our captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the Turks and Caicos Islands of the British West Indies, where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ). At the federal level, Congress enacted comprehensive financial regulatory reform legislation in 2010. A significant focus of the law, known as the Dodd-Frank Act, is heightened consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ), which has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of non-depository lenders and to promulgate rules that can affect the practices and activities of lenders. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder may affect our operations through increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB and the imposition of restrictions on the terms of certain loans. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the protections established in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. To that end, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB the authority to establish supervisory authority over a nonbank covered person that it has reasonable cause to determine is engaging, or has engaged, in conduct that poses risks to consumers. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB the authority to examine and regulate large non-depository financial companies and gives the CFPB authority over entities deemed by rule to be a larger participant of a market for other consumer financial products or services. The CFPB contemplates regulating the installment lending industry as part of the consumer credit and related activities market. However, this so-called larger participant rule will not impose substantive consumer protection requirements, but rather will provide to the CFPB the authority to supervise larger participants in certain markets by requiring reports and conducting examinations to ensure, among other things, that larger participants are complying with existing federal consumer financial laws. While the CFPB has defined a larger participant standard for certain markets, such as the debt collection, automobile finance, and consumer reporting markets, it has not yet acted to define larger participant in the traditional installment lending market. 
 In addition to the grant of certain regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. 
 Other Federal Laws and Regulations. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act and state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, numerous other federal laws and regulations affect our lending operations. These laws include the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and in each case the regulations thereunder, and the Federal Trade Commission s Credit Practices Rule. These laws require us to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower prior to the consummation of the loan transaction, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices, govern the manner in which we report customer information to consumer reporting agencies, govern the terms of loans to servicemembers, and proscribe unfair credit practices. 

Truth in Lending Act. Under the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, we must disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments, and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, we cannot discriminate against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. We are also required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise customers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the denial. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we must provide certain information to customers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency, promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a customer, and have a process by which customers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. 

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is designed to ease legal and financial burdens on military personnel and their families during active-duty status. We may be required to reduce interest rates on pre- 

Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 11 

service debts incurred by servicemembers, and we may be prohibited from pursuing certain forms of legal action against servicemembers, such as default judgments, during periods of active duty. 

Military Lending Act. The Military Lending Act applies to active duty servicemembers and their covered dependents. We are prohibited from charging a borrower covered under the Military Lending Act more than a 36 Military Annual Percentage Rate, which includes certain costs associated with the loan in calculating the interest rate. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we must protect the confidentiality of our customers non-public personal information and disclose information on our privacy policy and practices, including with regard to the sharing of customers non-public personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be provided at the time the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter. 

Credit Practices Rule. The Federal Trade Commission s Credit Practices Rule limits the types of property we may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan. 

 Violations of these statutes, laws, and regulations may result in actions for damages, claims for refund of payments made, certain fines and penalties, injunctions against certain practices, and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans. In addition, because we utilize third-party debt collectors, we are responsible for oversight of their procedures and controls, as they pertain to our collection activities.

 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 We have grown significantly in recent years, and our delinquency, credit loss rates, and overall results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not manage our growth effectively. 
 We have experienced substantial growth in recent years, increasing the size of our finance receivable portfolio from 834.0 million at the beginning of 2018 to 1.7 billion at the end of 2022, a compound annual growth rate of 15.3 . We intend to continue our growth strategy in the future. As we increase the number of branches we operate, we will be required to find new, or relocate existing, employees to operate our branches and allocate resources to train and supervise those employees. The success of a branch depends significantly on the manager overseeing its operations and on our ability to enforce our underwriting standards and implement controls over branch operations. Recruiting suitable managers for new branches can be challenging, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face significant competition. Furthermore, the annual turnover rate among our branch managers was approximately 17 in 2021 and 23 in 2022, and turnover rates of managers in our new branches may be similar or higher. Increasing the number of branches that we operate may divide the attention of our senior management or strain our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth. If we are unable to promote, relocate, or recruit suitable managers, oversee their activities effectively, maintain our underwriting and loan servicing standards, and otherwise appropriately 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 13 

and effectively staff our branches, our delinquency and credit loss rates may increase and our overall results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 We face significant risks in implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside of our control. 
 We intend to continue our growth strategy, which is based on opening and acquiring branches in existing and new markets, introducing new products and channels, and increasing the finance receivable portfolios of our existing branches. Our ability to execute this growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including: 

the inherent uncertainty regarding general economic conditions, including the impact of recent elevated inflation 

the prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate and federal laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change at any time 

the degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers 

our ability to identify attractive locations for new branches 

our ability to recruit qualified personnel, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face a great deal of competition and 

our ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans. 

 For example, certain states into which we may expand limit the number of lending licenses granted. For instance, Georgia and New Mexico require a convenience and advantage assessment of a new lending license and location prior to the granting of the license. This assessment adds time and expense to opening new locations and creates risk that our state regulator will deny an application for a new lending license due to a perceived oversaturation of existing licensed lenders in the area in which we seek to expand and operate. There can be no assurance that if we apply for a license for a new branch, whether in one of the states where we currently operate or in a state into which we would like to expand, we will be granted a license to operate. We also cannot be certain that any such license, even if granted, would be obtained in a timely manner or without burdensome conditions or limitations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals, government permits, or licenses that may be required to operate. 
 We are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities. 
 Our ability to collect on loans depends on the willingness and repayment ability of our borrowers. Any material adverse change in the effectiveness of our underwriting models, our implementation of such models (including through our loan origination software and processes), or the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us, whether due to changes in general economic, political, or social conditions, the cost of consumer goods, interest rates, natural disasters, military conflict or acts of war or terrorism, a prolonged public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic (such as COVID-19), or other causes over which we have no control, or to changes or events affecting our borrowers such as unemployment, major medical expenses, bankruptcy, divorce, or death, would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. Further, a substantial majority of our borrowers are non-prime borrowers who are more likely to be affected, and more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. We cannot be certain that our credit administration personnel, policies, and procedures will adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. 
 Our convenience check strategy exposes us to certain risks. 
 A significant portion of the growth in our installment loans portfolio has been achieved through direct mail campaigns. One aspect of our direct mail campaigns involves mailing convenience checks to pre-screened recipients, which recipients can sign and cash or deposit, thereby agreeing to the terms of the proposed loan, which are disclosed on the front and back of the check and in the accompanying disclosures. We use convenience checks to seed new branch openings and to attract new customers to existing branches in our geographic footprint. In 2021 and 2022, loans initiated through convenience checks represented 22.8 and 27.2 , respectively, of the value of our originated installment loans. We expect that convenience checks will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our installment loan originations in the future. There are several risks associated with the use or origination of convenience checks, including the following: 

it is more difficult to maintain sound underwriting standards with convenience check customers who historically have presented a higher risk of default than customers that originate loans in our branches, as we do not meet convenience check customers prior to soliciting them and extending a loan to them, and we may not be able to verify certain elements of their financial condition, including their current employment status, income, or life circumstances 

Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 14 

we rely on credit information from a third-party credit bureau that is more limited than a full credit report to pre-screen potential convenience check recipients, which may not be as effective as a full credit report or may be inaccurate or outdated 

we face limitations on the number of potential borrowers who meet our lending criteria within proximity to our branches 

we may not be able to continue to access the demographic and credit file information that we use to generate our mailing lists due to expanded regulatory or privacy restrictions 

convenience checks pose a risk of fraud 

any failure by the bank that issues and processes our convenience checks to properly process the convenience checks could limit the ability of a recipient to cash the check and enter into a loan with us 

customers may opt out of direct mail solicitations and solicitations based on their credit file or may otherwise prohibit us from soliciting them 

postal rates and production costs may continue to rise 

potential changes in federal or state laws may prohibit the practice of directly mailing convenience checks to potential borrowers and 

the bank that issues our convenience checks may exit the business, and we may be unable to find a replacement issuer bank. 

 In the future, we could experience one or more of these issues associated with our direct mail strategy. Any increase in the use of convenience checks will further increase our exposure to, and the magnitude of, these risks. 
 The loans that we generate are generally obligations of non-prime borrowers and will likely have higher default rates than loans constituting primarily obligations of prime borrowers. 
 The loans we generate are generally obligations of non-prime borrowers who do not qualify for, or have difficulty qualifying for, credit from traditional sources of consumer credit as result of, among other things, moderate income, limited assets, other adverse income characteristics, and/or a limited credit history or an impaired credit record, which may include a history of irregular employment, previous bankruptcy filings, repossessions of property, charged-off loans, and/or garnishment of wages. 
 The average interest rate charged to such non-prime borrowers generally is higher than that charged by commercial banks and other institutions providing traditional sources of consumer credit. These traditional sources of consumer credit typically impose more stringent credit requirements than the personal loan products that we provide. As a result of the general credit profile of our borrowers and the interest rates on the loans we make, the historical delinquency and default experience on our loans may be higher (and may be significantly higher) than those experienced by financial products arising from traditional sources of consumer credit. Additionally, delinquency and default experience on our loans is likely to be more sensitive to changes in the economic climate in the areas in which our borrowers reside. 
 Social and economic factors may affect repayment of the loans comprising our loan portfolio. 
 The ability of our borrowers to make payments on their loans, as well as the prepayment experience thereon, will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors. Economic factors include interest rates, unemployment levels, gasoline prices, the availability and cost of credit (including mortgages), upward adjustments in monthly mortgage payments, real estate values, the rate of inflation, and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally. Economic conditions may also be impacted by localized weather events and environmental disasters or adverse impacts from public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics (such as COVID-19). Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels and attitudes toward incurring debt and changing attitudes regarding the stigma of personal bankruptcy. 
 Our policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing loans are subject to potential failure or circumvention, which may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Except for loans originated by a centralized branch and serviced at a centralized location pursuant to a limited program we operate in select markets, a substantial portion of our underwriting activities and our credit extension decisions are made at our local branches. We rely on certain inputs and verifications in the underwriting process to be performed by individual personnel at the branch level or a centralized location. In addition, pursuant to our operations policies and procedures, exceptions to the general underwriting criteria can be approved by central underwriting employees and certain other senior employees. We train our employees individually onsite in the branch or at a centralized location and through online training modules to make loans that 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 15 

conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management, and customer relations. Although we have standardized employee manuals and online training modules, we primarily rely on our d istrict s upervisors, with oversight by our s tate v ice p residents, branch auditors, and headquarters personnel, to train and supervise our branch employees, rather than centralized training programs. Therefore, the quality of training and supervision may vary from district to district and branch to branch depending on the amount of time apportioned to training and supervision and individual interpretations of our operations policies and procedures. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel to perform the tasks that are part of the underwriting process. If the training or supervision of our personnel fails to be effective, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, it is possible that our underwriting criteria would be improperly applied to a greater percentage of such applications. If such improper applications were to increase, delinquency and losses on our loan portfolio could increase and could increase significantly . 
 In addition, we rely on certain third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting and origination. Any error or failure by a third-party service provider in providing loan underwriting and origination services may cause us to originate loans to borrowers that do not meet our underwriting standards. We cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules. We have experienced instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. Variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and credit losses than we have historically experienced. Due to the general decentralized nature in which the loan application process occurs, employee misconduct or error in the application or closing process could also result in the origination of loans that do not satisfy our underwriting standards, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely heavily on information provided by customers, counterparties, and other third parties, including credit bureaus and data aggregators, the inaccuracy or incompleteness of which may adversely affect our results of operations. We further rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. If a significant percentage of our customers were to intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information, or provide incomplete information, and our internal processes were to fail to detect such misrepresentations in a timely manner, or any or all of the other components of the underwriting process described above were to fail, it could result in our approval of a loan that, based on our underwriting criteria, we would not have otherwise made. As a result, our earnings and our financial condition could be negatively impacted. 
 We may be limited in our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, and the security interests securing a significant portion of our loan portfolio are not perfected, which may increase our credit losses. 
 Legal and practical limitations may limit our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, resulting in increased credit losses, decreased revenues, and decreased earnings. State and federal laws and regulations restrict our collection efforts. The amounts that we are able to recover from the repossession and sale of collateral typically do not fully cover the outstanding loan balance and costs of recovery. In cases where we repossess a vehicle securing a loan, we generally sell our repossessed automobile inventory through sales conducted by independent automobile auction organizations after the required post-repossession waiting period. In certain instances, we may sell repossessed collateral other than vehicles through our branches after the required post-repossession waiting period and appropriate receipt of valid bids. In either case, such sales are made consistent with applicable state law. The proceeds we receive from such sales depend upon various factors, including the supply of, and demand for, used vehicles and other property at the time of sale. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, there may be less demand for used vehicles and other property that we desire to resell. 
 Most of our loan portfolio is secured, but a significant portion of such security interests have not been and will not be perfected, which means that we cannot be certain that such security interests will be given first priority over other creditors. The lack of perfected security interests is one of several factors that may make it more difficult for us to collect on our loan portfolio. Additionally, for those of our loans that are unsecured, borrowers may choose to repay obligations under other indebtedness before repaying loans to us because such borrowers may feel that they have no collateral at risk. In addition, given the relatively small size of our loans, the costs of collecting loans may be high relative to the amount of the loan. As a result, many collection practices that are legally available, such as litigation, may be financially impracticable. Lastly, there is an inherent risk that a portion of the retail installment contracts that we hold will be subject to certain claims or defenses that the borrower may assert against the originator of the contract and, by extension, us as the holder of the contract. These factors may increase our credit losses, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 16 

Our insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. 
 We market and sell optional credit life, accident and health, personal property, involuntary unemployment, and vehicle single interest insurance to our borrowers in selected markets as an agent for an unaffiliated third-party insurance company. In addition, on certain loans, we collect a fee from our customers and use such fee to acquire non-file insurance from an unaffiliated insurance company for our benefit in lieu of recording and perfecting our security interest in certain personal property collateral. The unaffiliated insurance company cedes to our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., all of these insurance policies, the related net insurance premium revenue and the associated insurance claims liability for such insurance products, including the non-file insurance that we purchase. 
 When purchased by a borrower, the optional credit insurance products benefit the borrower by insuring the borrower s payment obligations on the associated loan in the event of the borrower s inability to make monthly payments due to death, disability, or involuntary unemployment, or in the event of a casualty event associated with collateral. The borrower finances payment of the associated premium with the financed premium included in the principal balance of the applicable loan. A credit insurance product may be cancelled if, for example, (i) we request cancellation due to the borrower s default on obligations under the associated loan, (ii) the borrower prepays the principal balance of the associated loan in full, or (iii) the borrower elects to terminate the credit insurance prior to the expiration of the term thereof (which the borrower may do at any time). Generally, upon any cancellation of credit insurance, the borrower will be entitled to a refund of the unearned premium for the cancelled insurance. We typically refund insurance premiums by reducing the principal balance of the associated loan by the required refund amount, following which the unaffiliated insurance company reimburses us for the refunded amount. 
 Our insurance operations are subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including changes in laws and regulations, borrower demand for insurance products, claims experience, and insurance carrier relationships the manner in which we are permitted to offer such products capital and reserve requirements the frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting to which we are subject benefits or loss ratio requirements insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements and reinsurance operations. In addition, because our borrowers are not required to purchase the credit insurance products that we offer, we cannot be certain that borrower demand for credit insurance products will not decrease in the future. In addition to adversely impacting our insurance income, net, any decrease in the demand for credit insurance products would negatively impact our interest and fee income because we finance substantially all of our borrowers insurance premiums. Our insurance operations are also dependent on our lending operations as the sole source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would have no method of distribution. Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are also difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims and associated expenses for claims adjudication. 
 We are also dependent on the continued willingness of unaffiliated third-party insurance companies to participate in the credit insurance market and to offer non-file insurance to us. If our insurance provider is for any reason unable or unwilling to meet its claims and premium reimbursement payment obligations or its premium ceding obligations, we would experience increased net credit losses, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other losses and expenses. 
 Finally, in recent years, as large loans have become a greater percentage of our portfolio, the severity of non-file insurance claims has increased and non-file insurance claims expenses have exceeded non-file insurance premiums by a material amount. The resulting net loss from the non-file insurance product is reflected in our insurance income, net. It is uncertain whether the non-file insurance product will be available to us in the future on the same terms as it is today, or at all. If the unaffiliated insurance company were to enforce limitations on our non-file loss ratios or otherwise change the terms under which it offers non-file insurance to us, our net credit losses, loss rates, and provision for credit losses could increase. 
 If any of these events, risks, or uncertainties were to occur or materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. 
 A reduction in demand for our products and a failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 The demand for the products we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences or financial conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products, or the availability of competing products, including through alternative or competing marketing channels. For example, we are highly dependent upon selecting and maintaining attractive branch locations. These locations are subject to local market conditions, including the employment available in the area, housing costs, traffic patterns, crime, and other demographic influences, any of which may quickly change, thereby negatively impacting demand for our products in the area. Should we fail to adapt to significant 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 17 

changes in our customers demand for, or access to, our products, our revenues could decrease significantly and our operations could be harmed. Even if we do make changes to existing products or introduce new products and channels to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and by that time it may be too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further harm to our business, financial condition , and results of operations . 
 We face strong direct and indirect competition. 
 The consumer finance industry is highly competitive, and the barriers to entry for new competitors are relatively low in the markets in which we operate. We compete for customers, locations, employees, and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national, and international financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources than we do. 
 Our installment loan operations compete with other installment lenders, as well as with alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops), online or peer-to-peer lenders, issuers of non-prime credit cards, and other competitors. We believe that future regulatory developments in the consumer finance industry may cause lenders that focus on alternative financial services to begin to offer installment loans. In addition, if companies in the installment loan business attempt to provide more attractive loan terms than is standard across the industry, we may lose customers to those competitors. With respect to installment loans, we compete primarily on the basis of price, breadth of loan product offerings, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided. 
 We may attempt to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that may be unsuccessful. 
 We may attempt to achieve our business objectives through acquisitions and strategic alliances. We compete with other companies for these opportunities, including companies with greater financial resources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Furthermore, most acquisition targets that we have pursued previously have been significantly smaller than us. We do not have extensive experience with integrating larger acquisitions. In pursuing these transactions, we may experience, among other things: 

overvaluing potential targets 

difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, branches, or products into our existing business, including integration of account data into our information systems 

inability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion, or at all 

attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses 

unexpected losses due to the acquisition of loan portfolios with loans originated using less stringent underwriting criteria 

significant costs, charges, or write-downs or 

unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations. 

 Geographic concentration of our loan portfolio may increase the risk of loss. 
 Any concentration of our loan portfolio in a state or region may present unique risk concentrations. Our branches in South Carolina, Texas, and North Carolina accounted for 11 , 34 , and 15 , respectively, of our finance receivables as of December 31, 2022. Further, as of December 31, 2022, all of our operations were across 18 states. As a result, we are highly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in these areas. The unemployment and bankruptcy rates in some states in our footprint are among the highest in the country. High unemployment rates may reduce the number of qualified borrowers to whom we will extend loans, which would result in reduced loan originations. In addition, some geographic regions of the United States will, from time to time, experience weaker regional economic conditions and consequently will experience higher rates of loss and delinquency. A regional economy may be affected by the loss of jobs in certain industries, by state and local taxes, or by other factors. A region s economic condition may be directly, or indirectly, adversely affected by international events such as military conflicts or wars, prolonged public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics (such as COVID-19), national events such as civil disturbances, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, and other extreme conditions (including an increase in frequency of such conditions and events as a result of climate change). These events and disasters may occur in any area of the country, even places where these events are considered unlikely. In the event that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans owed by borrowers residing in certain jurisdictions, economic conditions, elevated bankruptcy filings, natural disasters, or other factors affecting these jurisdictions 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 18 

in particular could adversely impact the delinquency and default experience of our loan portfolio, and , we could experience reduced or delayed payments on outstanding loans. For example, in 2017 and 2018, we experienced increases in credit losses as a result of hurricanes impacting customer accounts in our geographic footprint. These losses occurred in states where a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is concentrated specifically in Texas in 2017 and in South Carolina and North Carolina in 2018. Conversely, an improvement in economic conditions could result in prepayments by our borrowers of their payment obligations on our loans. As a result, we may receive principal payments on the outstanding loans earlier than anticipated, which would reduce our finance receivables and the interest income earned thereon. No prediction can be made and no assurance can be given as to the effect of economic conditions on the rate of delinquencies, prepayments, or losses on our loan portfolio with respect to any part of our geographic footprint. 
 Further, the concentration of our loan portfolio in one or more states would have a disproportionate effect on our business if governmental authorities in any of those states take action against us. In addition, the occurrence of any of the adverse regulatory or legislative events described in this Risk Factors section in states with a high concentration of our loan portfolio could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, if interest rates in South Carolina, which currently are not capped, were to be capped, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 
 Failure of third-party service providers upon which we rely could adversely affect our operations. 
 We rely on certain third-party service providers. In particular, we currently rely on one key vendor to print and mail our convenience check and other offers for direct mail marketing campaigns, and on certain other third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting, origination, and servicing. Our reliance on these third parties can expose us to certain risks. For example, an error by our convenience check vendor in 2015 resulted in check offers being misdirected to the wrong potential customers, requiring us in some cases to notify state regulators and to refund certain interest and fee amounts, and exposing us to increased credit risk. If any of our third-party service providers, including those third parties providing services in connection with loan underwriting, origination, and servicing, are unable to provide their services timely, accurately, and effectively, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. 
 A failure of information technology products and services on which we rely could disrupt our business. 
 In the operation of our business, we are highly dependent upon a variety of information technology products, including our loan management system, which allows us to record, document, and manage our loan portfolio. We are party to an agreement with Nortridge pursuant to which Nortridge provides us with loan management software and related services. 
 We have tailored the Nortridge software to meet our specific needs. To a certain extent, we depend on the willingness and ability of Nortridge to continue to provide customized solutions and to support our evolving products and business model. In the future, Nortridge may not be willing or able to provide the services necessary to meet our loan management system needs. If this occurs, we may be forced to migrate to an alternative software package, which could cause an interruption in our operations. 
 Further, the Nortridge platform may in the future fail to perform in a manner consistent with our current expectations and may be inadequate for our needs. As we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected if our loan management system does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could materially impact our ability to perform necessary business operations. 
 Further, the Nortridge platform and other third-party software vendor products and applications are subject to damage or interruption from: 

power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications, or data network failures 

operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees 

physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation, and similar events 

computer viruses 

cyberterrorism 

intentional acts of vandalism and similar events and 

hurricanes, fires, floods, and other natural disasters. 

Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 19 

Any failure of the Nortridge platform or any other third-party software vendor product systems due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan, could cause an interruption in operations. Though we have implemented contingency and disaster recovery processes in the event of one or several technology failures, any unforeseen failure, interruption, or compromise of these systems or security measures could affect our origination, servicing, and collection of loans. The risk of possible failures or interruptions may not be adequately addressed, and such failures or interruptions could occur. 
 For example, in January 2020, we experienced an information technology infrastructure event caused by a system backup that affected our ability to originate branch loans and process certain methods of payment. As a result, our loan management system was not fully operational for a total of approximately seven business days. The outage had an adverse impact on our results of operations. Although the Company, with the assistance of third-party experts, addressed and resolved the issue, there can be no assurance that a similar event will not occur in the future. 
 We also rely on third-party software vendors to provide access to loan applications and/or screen applications. There can be no assurance that these third-party providers will continue to provide us information in accordance with our lending guidelines or that they will continue to provide us lending leads at all. 
 We rely on Amazon Web Services and VMWare for the majority of our computing, storage, networking, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services and VMWare products and services would negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business. 
 Amazon Web Services AWS and VMWare, Inc. VMWare provide the technology infrastructure we use to run our business operations. The technology infrastructure provided includes data center hosting facilities operated by AWS and software defined data center technologies provided by VMWare. Any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS or VMWare products and services would negatively impact our operations and our business would be adversely affected. If our branches or customers encounter difficulties in accessing or are unable to access our platform, we may lose customers and revenue. Due to the nature of the AWS and VMWare products and services provided, we are unable to easily transition from these vendors to other providers, and any such transition could require business downtime that could negatively impact our business. AWS and VMWare also possess broad discretion to interpret and change their terms of services and other policies that apply to us, which may be unfavorable to our business. 
 Our technology platforms may not meet expectations, and we may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors. 
 The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services, and marketing channels. We rely on our integrated branch network as the foundation of our omni-channel platform and the primary point of contact with our active accounts. In order to serve consumers who want to reach us over the internet, we make an online loan application available on our consumer website, and we provide our customers an online customer portal, giving them online access to their account information and an electronic payment option. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demand for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer finance industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be more efficient than those that we currently use. We cannot ensure that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could cause disruptions in our operations, harm our ability to compete with our competitors, and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 Security breaches, cyber-attacks, failures in our information systems, or fraudulent activity could result in damage to our operations or lead to reputational damage. 
 We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Each branch is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis, and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches (including via computer hackings), unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, malware, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, or other failures or disruptions that could result in disruption to our business or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer, employee, and business information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, including any failure of our back-up systems, hardware failures, or an inability to access data maintained offsite, could 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 20 

result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, loan, and other systems and could result in a loss of data (including loan portfolio data), a loss of customer business, or a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation, possible financial liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect for long periods of time. Accordingly, we may not be able to detect immediately any such breach, which may increase the losses that we would suffer. In addition, our existing insurance policies would not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a breach. 
 A security breach or cyber-attack on our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. We have implemented systems and processes designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information, and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account, credit card, and other personal information. Despite the implementation of these security measures, there is no guarantee that they are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches and our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. We may also face new or heightened risks related to remote work among certain of our employees and use of digital operations, both of which have become more common as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we were to experience a security breach or cyber-attack, we could be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including, among other things, the following: 

expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack 

liability for stolen assets or information 

costs of repairing damage to our systems 

lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack 

increased costs of cyber security protection 

costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business and 

damage to our reputation causing customers and investors to lose confidence in our company. 

 Further, any compromise of security or cyber-attack could deter consumers from entering into transactions that require them to provide confidential information to us. In addition, if confidential customer information or information belonging to our business partners is misappropriated from our computer systems, we could be sued by those who assert that we did not take adequate precautions to safeguard our systems and confidential data belonging to our customers or business partners, which could subject us to liability and result in significant legal fees and expenses in defending these claims. As a result, any compromise of security of our computer systems or cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 As part of our business, and subject to applicable privacy laws, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches, and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information that we share with them. If our proprietary or confidential customer information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and liquidity. Although we maintain insurance that is intended to cover certain losses from such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate or available. 
 Pandemics, epidemics, and similar public health crises, including the emergence of new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) variants that result in another pandemic, could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in economic disruption and uncertainty within the United States and created significant long-term adverse social, economic, and financial effects in the United States and globally. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities took unprecedented actions in an attempt to limit the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders, mandatory quarantines, closure of non-essential businesses, face mask mandates, and building capacity limitations. While our business was generally classified by government authorities as essential and permitted to remain open during previous government-mandated COVID-19 business closures, we were required to temporarily close our branches in the state of New Mexico for approximately a month in 2020 when the governor issued an executive order to close non-essential 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 21 

businesses that excluded consumer finance companies like us from the definition of essential business es . We also experienced temporary closure of certain locations due to company-initiated quarantine measures. If there is a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or another public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic arises, governmental authorities c ould impose new or similar restrictions to those imposed previously during the COVID-19 pandemic. If a new public health crisis emerges, we could also deem it prudent to reinstate company-initiated quarantines or other restrictions. Any such government - or company - mandated restrictions could have a material and direct adverse consequence on our business. Any negative impacts to our loan growth, collections, and delinquencies caused by a future public health crisis could adversely impact our revenues and other results of operations. 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have relied more heavily on online operations for customer access. Should there be a COVID-19 resurgence or a new public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic and we experience disruptions in our online operations, including our remote origination capabilities, or are unable to timely expand our remote working infrastructure in response to government or company initiated restrictions, we may be unable to timely and effectively service accounts and perform key business functions. Disruptions in our business could also result from the inability of key personnel and/or a significant portion of our workforce to fulfill their duties due to illness or restriction. We maintain business continuity plans, but there is no assurance that such plans will effectively mitigate the risks posed by any pandemic, epidemic, or similar public health crisis in the future. 
 The extent to which any COVID-19 resurgence and/or new public health crises, epidemics, or pandemics will ultimately impact our business and financial condition will depend on future events that are difficult to forecast, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the event (including as a result of waves of outbreak or variant strains), the success of actions taken to contain, treat, and prevent the pathogen, and the speed at which normal economic and operating conditions return and are sustained. 
 Centralized headquarters functions and branch operations are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our headquarters are in an office building located in Greer, South Carolina, a town located outside of Greenville, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our branches from this centralized location. Our primary data center facility is located in Northern Virginia, and our backup data center is located in Ohio . These processes could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage, or act of terror, affected Greenville, Greer, Northern Virginia, or Ohio, or the nearby areas. Severe weather events that could cause damage to our facilities or the prolonged loss of power that would disrupt our ability to provide services are occurring more frequently, and there is no guarantee that our facilities will avoid such a weather event. Any such catastrophic event(s) or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters or data center facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The decentralized nature of our origination and servicing creates additional risks. 
 We utilize a centralized branch structure in a limited number of markets with the intent that such centralized branch service our customer base however, we conduct significant operations through our branch offices, including key parts of the underwriting process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to perform these tasks. Inadequate staffing may result in scenarios where fraud or noncompliance with applicable law is not as readily detected, and also may result in heightened exposure to potential employee misconduct, each of which could adversely affect the quality of the loans that we originate or otherwise acquire. 
 Our branches also serve as an important component of our ongoing servicing and collecting processes. Except for loans originated by a centralized branch and serviced at a centralized location in a limited number of markets, the primary responsibility for the servicing and collections process generally resides with the applicable local branch, although in the future, we may direct borrowers to remit payments through one or more lockboxes. A certain minimum level of staffing is necessary in order to ensure an adequate level of servicing and collections. For example, we seek to contact our customers soon after a loan becomes delinquent because historically, when collection efforts begin at an earlier stage of delinquency, there is a greater likelihood that the applicable personal loan will not be charged off (though there is no assurance that such historical trend will continue). Consequently, during periods of increased delinquencies, it becomes extremely important that our branches are properly staffed and trained to take appropriate action in an effort to bring delinquent balances current and ultimately avoid a loan from becoming charged off. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified credit and collection personnel, it could result in increased delinquencies and credit losses on our loan portfolio. 
 Additionally, the decentralized nature of our branch model may make it more difficult for us to ensure compliance with our origination, acquisition, and servicing procedures and standards than if our operations were centralized in a single location. Similarly, 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 22 

given the decentralized and largely manual processing of a significant portion of payment on our loans, the possibility of delay or misdirection of payments is greater than with payments through lockboxes or electronic channels. 
 The ability of our customers to make in-branch payments and any future inability to make in-branch payments may result in additional risks. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our integrated branch network consisted of 345 branches across 18 states. With respect to our managed portfolio of loan products , during fiscal year 2022, approximately 15 (by dollar amount) of our loan payments were made by cash or check and received in branch, although in the future we may direct borrowers to remit payments through one or more lockboxes. Despite a recent trend in favor of payments via electronic channels, a significant number of borrowers may continue to make payments in branches, including in cash, ACH, or by debit. While we cannot estimate the percentage of borrowers without a checking account, should one or more of the branches become unavailable for any reason for the acceptance of payments, the ability to collect payments from these borrowers who would otherwise make payments at such branch may be adversely affected. Such events could result in increased delinquencies and losses on our loan portfolio. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the number of borrowers that make cash payments or payments in person at our branches in the future will not increase over current levels. In the event that such cash payments are no longer accepted, there can be no assurance that the performance of our loan portfolio would not be adversely affected, resulting in increased delinquencies and losses on our loan portfolio. 
 Regular turnover among our managers and other employees at our branches makes it more difficult for us to operate our branches and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. In the past, we have lost employees and candidates to competitors who have been willing to pay higher compensation. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees. The turnover among all of our branch employees has risen in each of our most recent fiscal years, from approximately 37 in 2019 to approximately 58 in 2022. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our branches. Our account executives and assistant manager roles have historically experienced high turnover. We may not be able to retain and cultivate personnel at these ranks for future promotion to branch manager. If our employee turnover rates continue to increase or remain above historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover and we are unable to readily replace such employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to continue to expand could be adversely affected. 
 The departure, transition, or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact the results of our operations. If we cannot continue to hire and retain high-quality employees, our business and financial results may be negatively affected. 
 Our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. Our operating results could be adversely affected by higher employee turnover or increased salary and benefit costs. Like most businesses, our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management, operational, finance, and administrative personnel. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values. We want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of compliance and of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, senior management, and operational positions. As our employees gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills, they become highly desired by other businesses. Therefore, to retain our employees, we must provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits. If costs to retain our skilled employees increase, then our business and financial results may be negatively affected. 
 Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining the current members of our executive or senior management team or our other key employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, senior management, or key team members, including state vice presidents, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We also depend on our district supervisors to supervise, train, and motivate our branch employees. These supervisors have significant experience with our company and within our industry, and would be difficult to replace. If we lose a district supervisor to a competitor, we could also be at risk of losing other employees and customers. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 23 

A nationwide labor shortage may impede our ability to identify and hire new employees. 
 The United States currently faces a pronounced labor shortage. Our business relies on branch and headquarters personnel to oversee the initiation, review, and servicing of our loan products. Without sufficient staffing, our core business functions could be interrupted, which could affect our results of operations. Further, if we are unable to identify and hire qualified personnel, we may be unable to grow our business effectively in current or new markets. 
 Employee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm. 
 Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or third-party contractors could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee or third-party contractor were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third-party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. 
 Security breaches in our branches or acts of theft, fraud, or violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 A portion of our account payments occur at our branches, either in person or by mail, and often consist of cash payments, which we deposit at local banks each day. This business practice exposes us daily to the potential for employee theft of funds or, alternatively, to theft and burglary due to the cash we maintain in our branches. Despite controls and procedures to prevent such losses, we have sustained losses due to employee theft and fraud (including collusion), including from the origination of fraudulent loans. We are also susceptible to break-ins at our branches, where money or customer records necessary for day-to-day operations (which also contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information) could be taken. A breach in the security of our branches or in the safety of our employees could result in employee injury, loss of funds or records, and adverse publicity, and could result in a loss of customer business or expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our branch offices have physical customer records necessary for day-to-day operations that contain extensive confidential information about our customers, including financial and personally identifiable information. The loss or theft of customer information and data from branch offices or other storage locations could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and penalties, and could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our risk management efforts may not be effective. 
 We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as regulatory and operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. 
 We may be unsuccessful in maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Controls and procedures are particularly important for consumer finance companies. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud or material error. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 24 

reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Any failure to maintain current internal controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their maintenance and/or implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. 
 If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future or if our controls and procedures fail or are circumvented, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our financial results, we may be unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. The discovery of a material weakness and the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market value of shares of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency requires management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency, and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency in a timely manner. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 If our estimate of allowance for credit losses is not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for credit losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses for all loans we make. To estimate the appropriate level of credit loss reserves, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability, including the total amount of loans outstanding delinquency levels, roll rates, and trends historical credit losses our current collection patterns and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for credit losses is based on models (probability of default, loss given default), our historical loss experience, and estimates of future macroeconomic environments. If customer behavior changes because of economic, political, social, or other conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate and general economic uncertainty may affect our credit loss allowance, our provision for credit losses may be inadequate. As of December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses was 159.3 million, and we had net credit losses of 130.1 million during fiscal year 2022 that related to our portfolio as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses was 178.8 million. Maintaining the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses may require significant and unanticipated changes in our provisions for credit losses, which would materially affect our results of operations. Our allowance for credit losses, however, is an estimate, and if actual credit losses are materially greater than our credit loss allowance, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for credit losses. 
 If assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 We are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), including in determining allowances for credit losses, the fair value of financial instruments, asset impairment, reserves related to litigation and other legal matters, the fair value of share-based compensation, and other taxes and regulatory exposures. In addition, significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under GAAP, including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB may from time-to-time review or propose changes to financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements, including areas where assumptions or estimates are required. As a result of any changes to financial accounting or reporting standards, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements, which could negatively impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 25 

We depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity needs. 
 We have a senior revolving credit facility committed through September 2024 that allows us to borrow up to 420.0 million, assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions. The senior revolving credit facility is collateralized by certain of our assets, including substantially all of our finance receivables (other than those held by certain special purpose entities (each, an SPE ), as described below) and equity interests of the majority of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the amount outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility was 147.5 million 146.4 million of outstanding debt and 1.2 million of interest payable) and we had 273.6 million of unused capacity on the credit facility (subject to certain covenants and conditions). During fiscal 2022, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the facility at any one time was 213.3 million. We use our senior revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity, including for working capital and to fund the loans we make to our customers. If our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted, we may need to try to raise additional capital in the future. If such an event were to occur, we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace the senior revolving credit facility when it matures on favorable terms or at all. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 The credit agreements governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business. 
 The credit agreements governing our senior revolving credit facility and revolving warehouse credit facilities contain a number of covenants that could adversely affect our business and our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or opportunities. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to: 

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness 

purchase loan portfolios in bulk 

pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments 

sell assets, including our loan portfolio or the capital stock of our subsidiaries 

enter into transactions with our affiliates 

create or incur liens and 

consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. 

 The credit agreements also impose certain obligations on us relating to our underwriting standards, recordkeeping and servicing of our loans, and our loss reserves and charge-off policies, and they require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including an interest coverage ratio. If we were to breach any covenants or obligations under our credit agreements and such breaches were to result in an event of default, our lenders could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. An event of default in any one credit agreement could also trigger cross-defaults under other existing and future credit agreements and other debt instruments, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to continue operating our business as a going concern. 
 Our securitizations may expose us to financing and other risks, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, which may require us to seek more costly financing. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have completed nine securitizations, and we may in the future securitize certain of our finance receivables to generate cash to originate new finance receivables or to pay our outstanding indebtedness. In such transactions, we typically convey a pool of finance receivables to a special purpose entity, which, in turn, conveys the finance receivables to a trust (the issuing entity). Concurrently, the issuing entity issues non-recourse notes or certificates pursuant to the terms of an indenture and/or amended and restated trust agreement, which then are transferred to the special purpose entity in exchange for the finance receivables. The securities issued by the issuing entity are secured by the pool of finance receivables. In exchange for the transfer of finance receivables to the issuing entity, we typically receive the cash proceeds from the sale of the securities issued by the issuing entity, all residual interests, if any, in the cash flows from the finance receivables after payment of the securities, and a 100 beneficial interest in the issuing entity. 
 Although we successfully completed securitizations during the past five years, we can give no assurances that we will be able to complete additional securitizations, including if, for example, the securitization markets become constrained or events within the Company cause investors to lack confidence in our ability to fulfill our obligations as servicer with respect to the securitizations. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 26 

Further, the value of any subordinated securities that we may retain in our securitizations might be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated as a result of an adverse change in economic conditions or other factors. 
 Regional Management Corp. currently acts as the servicer (in such capacity, the Servicer with respect to each securitization. If the Servicer defaults in its servicing obligations, an early amortization event could occur under each securitization and the Servicer could be replaced as servicer. Servicer defaults include, but are not limited to, the failure of the Servicer to make any payment, transfer, or deposit in accordance with applicable securitization documents breaches of representations, warranties, or certifications made by the Servicer under applicable securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the Servicer. Such an early amortization event could have materially adverse consequences on our liquidity and cost of funds. 
 Rating agencies may also affect our ability to execute a securitization transaction or increase the costs we expect to incur from executing securitization transactions, not only by deciding not to issue ratings for our securitization transactions, but also by altering the processes and criteria they follow in issuing ratings. Rating agencies could alter their ratings processes or criteria after we have accumulated finance receivables for securitization in a manner that effectively reduces the value of those finance receivables by increasing our financing costs or otherwise requiring that we incur additional costs in order to comply with those processes and criteria. We have no ability to control or predict what actions the rating agencies may take. 
 Further, other matters, such as (i) accounting standards applicable to securitization transactions and (ii) capital and leverage requirements applicable to banks and other regulated financial institutions holding asset-backed securities, could result in decreased investor demand for securities issued through our securitization transactions or increased competition from other institutions that undertake securitization transactions. In addition, compliance with certain regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act, may affect the type of securitization transactions that we are able to complete. 
 An inability to consummate further securitization transactions on terms similar to our existing securitization transactions, or at all, could require us to seek more costly financing and/or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may be required to indemnify, or repurchase certain finance receivables from, purchasers of finance receivables that we have sold or securitized, or which we will sell or securitize in the future, if our finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
 We have entered into certain financing arrangements, including revolving warehouse credit facilities and securitizations, which are secured by certain retail installment contracts and promissory notes (the Receivables ). We have securitized Receivables as follows: June 2018 (approximately 168.5 million) December 2018 (approximately 135.5 million) October 2019 (approximately 144.5 million) September 2020 (approximately 187.5 million) February 2021 (approximately 260.4 million) July 2021 (approximately 208.3 million) October 2021 (approximately 147.1 million) February 2022 (approximately 264.6 million) and October 2022 (approximately 232.6 million). The securitizations from June 2018, December 2018, and October 2019 have been redeemed and are no longer outstanding . Our operating subsidiaries originated the Receivables and subsequently transferred the Receivables to certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries that were established for the special purpose of entering into the financing arrangements and the respective securitizations. The documents governing our financing arrangements and securitizations contain provisions that require us to repurchase the affected Receivables under certain circumstances. While our financing and securitization documents vary, they generally contain customary provisions that require us and the special purpose entities to make certain representations and warranties about the quality and nature of the Receivables. Together with the special purpose entities, we may be required to repurchase the Receivables if a representation or warranty is later determined to be inaccurate. In such a case, we will be required to pay a repurchase price for the release of the affected Receivables. 
 We believe that many purchasers of loans and other counterparties to transactions like those provided for in the revolving warehouse credit facilities, the securitizations, and other similar transactions are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators or sellers of such finance receivables must indemnify for or repurchase finance receivables, and may benefit from enforcing any available repurchase remedies. If we are required to repurchase Receivables that we have sold or pledged, it could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We are subject to interest rate risk resulting from general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies. 
 Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect our results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. In response to elevated inflation, the Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates eight times since early 2022, with federal funds rates rising from a range of 0.00 - 0.25 in early 2022 to 4.50 - 4.75 in February 2023. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will raise rates further if deemed necessary to combat continued inflation growth. Furthermore, market conditions or regulatory restrictions on interest rates we charge may prevent us from passing any increases in interest rates along to our customers. We originate finance receivables at either prevailing market rates or at statutory limits. Subject to statutory limits, our ability to react to changes in prevailing market rates is dependent upon the speed at which our customers pay off or renew loans in our existing loan portfolio, which allows us to originate new loans at prevailing market rates. Because our large loans have longer maturities than our small loans and typically renew at a slower rate than our small loans, the rate of turnover of the loan portfolio may change as our large loans change as a percentage of our portfolio. 
 In addition, rising interest rates will increase our cost of capital by influencing the amount of interest we pay on our senior revolving credit facility, our revolving warehouse credit facilities, or any other floating interest rate obligations that we may incur, which would increase our operating costs and decrease our operating margins. Interest payable on our senior revolving credit facility and our revolving warehouse credit facilities is variable and could increase in the future. 
 For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Replacement of LIBOR as the basis on which our variable rate debt is calculated may harm our cost of capital, financial results, and cash flows. 
 In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it will cease publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors as of June 30, 2023 for the most common tenors, and it has already ceased publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors for less common tenors. 
 As a replacement rate, many lenders are using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). In September 2022, we amended and restated our senior, RMR II warehouse, and RMR IV warehouse revolving credit facilities, transitioning the benchmark rate for the calculation of interest with a forward-looking term rate from LIBOR to SOFR, effective on October 1, 2022. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and has a very limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on its limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR in April 2018, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as U.S. dollar LIBOR. Additionally, any successor rate to SOFR under our credit facilities may not have the same characteristics as SOFR or LIBOR. As a result, the consequences of the phase-out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. 
 Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk. 
 From time to time, we enter into derivative transactions for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative transaction to perform its obligations. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and may increase loan defaults and affect the value and liquidity of your investment. 
 We are not insulated from the pressures and potentially negative consequences of financial crises and similar risks beyond our control that have in the past and may in the future affect the capital and credit markets, the broader economy, the financial services industry, or the segment of that industry in which we operate. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to make payments on outstanding loans, is highly dependent upon the business and economic environments in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. 
 The U.S. economy is undergoing a period of rapid change and significant uncertainty. Elevated inflation, increasing interest rates, and changing U.S. consumer spending patterns are contributing to this change and uncertainty. Inflation hit a 40-year high in June 2022 at 9.1 , while the U.S. annual inflation rate was 6.5 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. In response to 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 28 

elevated inflation, the Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates eight times since early 2022, with federal funds rates rising from a range of 0.00 - 0.25 in early 2022 to 4.50 - 4.75 in February 2023. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will raise rates further if deemed necessary to combat continued inflation growth. The recent increases in inflation and interest rates are changing lending and spending patterns, leading to fears that the U.S. is currently experiencing (or may soon experience) an economic downturn or period of slow economic growth. 
 During an economic downturn or recession, credit losses in the financial services industry generally increase and demand for credit products often decreases. Declining asset values, defaults on consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, all combine to decrease liquidity during an economic downturn. As a result of these factors, some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses during economic downturns, and the strength and liquidity of many financial institutions worldwide weakened during the most recent economic crisis. Additionally, during an economic downturn, our loan servicing costs and collection costs may increase as we may have to expend greater time and resources on these activities. Our underwriting criteria, policies and procedures, and product offerings may not sufficiently protect our growth and profitability during a sustained period of economic downturn or recession. Any renewed economic downturn will adversely affect the financial resources of our customers and may result in the inability of our customers to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, the outstanding debt when due. 
 Should economic conditions worsen, they may adversely affect the credit quality of our loans. In the event of increased default by borrowers under the loans, and/or a decrease in the volume of the loans we originate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Failure to maintain, protect, and promote our brand may harm our business. 
 Maintaining, protecting, and promoting our brand is critical to our attracting and retaining customers, investors, and employees. Harm to our brand can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by outsourced service providers or other counterparties, litigation or regulatory actions, failure by us to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of customer information, and compliance failures. Recently, financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers take issue with certain of their practices. Negative publicity regarding our company (or others engaged in a similar business or activities), whether or not accurate, may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Many of our stakeholders possess increased interest in our environmental, social, and governance responsibilities. Our absolute and relative progress, or lack thereof, on environmental, social, and governance matters, along with our disclosure (or lack of disclosure) related thereto, could impact our reputation, brand, and the willingness of individuals and institutions to hold our common stock. If we do not successfully maintain, protect, and promote our brand, we may be unable to maintain and/or expand our customer and/or investor base, which may materially harm our business. 
 Risks Related to Regulation and Legal Proceedings 
 Our business products and activities are strictly and comprehensively regulated at the local, state, and federal levels. 
 The consumer finance industry is extensively regulated by federal, state, and local consumer protection laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the creation, collection, and enforcement of consumer contracts, such as consumer loans. Personal loans that do not comply with consumer protection laws may not be enforceable against the borrowers of those loans. These laws and regulations impose significant costs and limitations on the way we conduct and expand our business, and these costs and limitations may increase in the future if such laws and regulations are changed. These laws and regulations govern or affect, among other things: 

the interest rates and manner of calculating such rates that we may charge customers 

terms of loans, including fees, maximum amounts, and minimum durations 

origination practices 

disclosure requirements, including posting of fees 

solicitation and advertising practices 

currency and suspicious activity reporting 

recording and reporting of certain financial transactions 

privacy of personal customer information 

Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 29 

the types of products and services that we may offer 

servicing and collection practices 

approval of licenses and 

locations of our branches. 

 Due to the highly regulated nature of the consumer finance industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations that affect, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our origination and servicing operations. These laws and regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, monitoring, and internal and external audits. Although we have an enterprise-wide compliance framework structured to continuously evaluate our activities, compliance with applicable law is costly and may create operational constraints. 
 At a federal level, these laws and their implementing regulations include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and requirements related to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, those listed above, such as usury laws and state debt collection practices laws that apply to first-party lenders. These laws affect how loans are made, enforced, and collected. The U.S. government and states may pass new laws, or may amend existing laws, to further regulate the consumer finance industry, installment loans, or to reduce the finance charges or other fees applicable to personal loans. 
 Federal and state consumer protection laws impose requirements, including licensing requirements, and place restrictions on creditors in connection with extensions of credit and collections on personal loans and protection of sensitive customer data obtained in the origination and servicing thereof. Personal loans that do not comply with consumer protection laws may not be valid or enforceable under their terms against the borrowers of those loans. Additionally, the CARES Act includes various provisions, such as requirements affecting credit reporting designed to protect customers. The federal and state consumer protection laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the solicitation and advertising for, underwriting of, granting, servicing, and collection of personal loans, and the protection of sensitive customer data, frequently provide for administrative penalties, as well as civil (and in some cases, criminal) liability resulting from their violation. An administrative proceeding or litigation relating to one or more allegations or findings of the violation of such laws by us could result in modifications to our methods of doing business, which could impair our ability to originate or otherwise acquire new loans or collect on our loan portfolio or result in us having to pay damages and/or cancel the balance or other amount owing under the loan associated with such violations. Our loans are subject to generally standard documentation. Thus, many borrowers may be similarly situated in so far as the provisions of their respective contractual obligations are concerned. Accordingly, allegations of violations of the provisions of applicable federal or state consumer protection laws could potentially result in a large class of claimants asserting claims against us. There is no assurance that such claims will not be asserted against us in the future. 
 Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including the interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that we may offer and increasing the ability of competitors to offer competing financial services and products. Compliance with laws and regulations requires us to invest increasingly significant portions of our resources in compliance planning and training, monitoring tools, and personnel, and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. Because these laws and regulations are complex and often subject to interpretation, or because of a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently violate these laws, regulations, and policies, as each is interpreted by our regulators. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, or judgments, our compliance costs could increase, our operations could be limited, and we may suffer damage to our reputation. If more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations are enacted or more restrictive judicial and administrative interpretations of current laws are issued, compliance with the laws could become more expensive or difficult. Furthermore, changes in these laws and regulations could require changes in the way we conduct our business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability. 
 Our primary regulators are the state regulators for the states in which we operate. We operate each of our branches under licenses granted to us by these state regulators. State regulators may enter our branches and conduct audits of our records and practices at any time, with or without notice. If we fail to observe, or are not able to comply with, applicable legal requirements, we 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 30 

may be forced to discontinue certain product offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition , and results of operations . In addition, violation of these laws and regulations could result in fines and other civil and/or criminal penalties, including the suspension or revocation of our branch licenses, rendering us unable to operate in one or more locations. All of the states in which we operate have laws governing the interest rates and fees that we can charge and required disclosure statements, among other restrictions. Violation of these laws could involve penalties requiring the forfeiture of principal and/or interest and fees that we have charged. Depending on the nature and scope of a violation, fines and other penalties for noncompliance of applicable requirements could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition , and results of operations . 
 While we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we may not be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits, and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could subject us to additional licensing, registration, and other regulatory requirements in the future or could adversely affect our ability to operate or the manner in which we conduct business. Licenses to open new branches are granted in the discretion of state regulators. Accordingly, licenses may be denied unexpectedly or for reasons outside of our control. This could hinder our ability to implement our business plans in a timely manner or at all. 
 As we enter new markets and develop new products and services, we may become subject to additional local, state, and federal laws and regulations. For example, although we intend to expand into new states or markets, we may encounter unexpected regulatory or other difficulties in these new states, including as they relate to securing the necessary licenses to operate, which may inhibit our growth. As a result, we may not be able to successfully execute our strategies to grow our revenue and earnings. 
 We are also subject to potential enforcement, supervision, or other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies. For example, the CFPB, state and federal banking regulators, state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and federal government agencies have imposed sanctions on consumer loan originators for practices including, but not limited to, charging borrowers excessive fees, steering borrowers to loans with higher costs or more onerous terms, imposing higher interest rates than the borrower s credit risk warrants, failing to disclose material terms of loans to borrowers, and otherwise engaging in discriminatory or unfair lending practices or unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, a contrary determination by a regulator, and any resulting action, could subject us to civil money penalties, customer remediation, and increased compliance costs, as well as damage to our reputation and brand and could limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices. 
 Additionally, Congress, the states, and regulatory agencies could further regulate the consumer credit industry in ways that make it more difficult for us to conduct business. Further, changes in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation of the laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions also could impact the manner in which we conduct our business. The regulatory environment in which financial institutions operate has become increasingly complex and robust, and following the financial crisis of 2008, supervisory efforts to apply relevant laws, regulations, and policies have become more intense. Any of the events described above could have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies. Should we become subject to such an investigation, examination, or proceeding, the matter could result in material adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, increased compliance costs, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunction, or other actions. 
 Changes in laws and regulations or interpretations of laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities are constantly under review and are subject to change. In addition, consumer advocacy groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict various financial products, including the loan products we offer. Any changes in such laws and regulations, or the implementation, interpretation, or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend, or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 31 

or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. 
 State and federal legislatures and regulators may also seek to impose new requirements or interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways. Changes in current laws or regulations or the implementation of new laws or regulations in the future may restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or expand our operations. For example, in 2019, bills were introduced to Congress that sought to prohibit the practice of directly mailing convenience checks to potential borrowers and extend the Military Lending Act s consumer protections to all consumers, including a 36 percent interest rate cap on all consumer loans. Similarly, in July 2021, the Veterans and Consumers Fair Credit Act was introduced in the Senate seeking to amend the Truth in Lending Act to effectively extend to all consumers the 36 interest rate cap that is currently only applicable to servicemembers and certain dependents under the Military Lending Act. While these bills have not become law, if similar bills were ultimately to become law, such legislation could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Additionally, new laws and regulations could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or lower or eliminate the profitability of operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we charge in connection with our loans or limiting the types of insurance and other ancillary products that we may offer to our customers. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we would also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs. 
 In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our business is subject to various local rules and regulations, such as local zoning regulations. Local zoning boards and other local governing bodies have been increasingly restricting the permitted locations of consumer finance companies. Any future actions taken to require special use permits for or impose other restrictions on our ability to provide products could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations or force us to attempt to relocate existing branches. If we were forced to relocate any of our branches, in addition to the costs associated with the relocation, we may be required to hire new employees in the new areas, which may adversely impact the operations of those branches. Relocation of an existing branch may also hinder our collection abilities, as our business model relies in part on the location of our branches being close to where our customers live in order to successfully collect on outstanding loans. 
 Changes in laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business in a particular state and on our overall business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to generate new loans and the manner in which existing loans are serviced and collected. 
 Financial regulatory reform has created uncertainty and could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In response to the financial crisis in 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the creation of new federal regulatory agencies and grants additional authorities and responsibilities to existing regulatory agencies to identify and address emerging systemic risks posed by the activities of financial services firms. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for enhanced regulation of derivatives and mortgage-backed securities offerings, restrictions on executive compensation, and enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits the ability of federal laws to preempt state and local consumer laws. 
 Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, as a consumer protection regulator tasked with regulating consumer financial services and products. Since its creation, the CFPB has been the subject of lawsuits challenging its authority. Currently of note, a writ of certiorari has been filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Community Financial Services Association of America, Limited v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which involves whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the statute providing funding to the CFPB violates the appropriations clause of the Constitution. There have also been legislative proposals in Congress from time to time seeking to significantly reform the CFPB s structure, authority, and/or mandate. As a result of these judicial and legislative actions, there is, and will continue to be, uncertainty regarding the future of the CFPB and the impact on the lending markets. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act impacts the offering, marketing and regulation of consumer financial products and services offered by financial institutions. The CFPB has supervision, examination, and enforcement authority over the consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. For example, the CFPB may establish supervisory authority over a nonbank covered entity that it has reasonable cause to determine is engaging, or has engaged, in conduct that poses risks to consumers. The CFPB also has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 32 

savings, and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions for compliance. 
 For example, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated by rule as larger participants in certain financial services markets, and the CFPB contemplates regulating the traditional installment lending industry in which we participate as part of the consumer credit and related activities market. In the past, the CFPB has indicated that it may in the future issue a proposed rule defining larger participants in the installment lending market. While the CFPB has not yet issued a larger participant rule applicable to our company, certain CFPB commentary has suggested that the CFPB may issue a proposed rule defining larger participants to include installment lending industry participants such as our company. If in the future we are covered by a final larger participant rule for the installment lending market, we could become subject to related CFPB supervision and examination. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act s grant of regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. 
 The CFPB is also authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Depending on how the CFPB functions and its areas of focus, it could increase our compliance costs, potentially delay our ability to respond to marketplace changes, require us to alter products and services that would make them less attractive to consumers, and impair our ability to offer products and services profitably. The CFPB is authorized to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from 6,813 per day for minor violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB s own rules) to 34,065 per day for reckless violations and 1,362,567 per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials find that we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on Regional. 
 In addition to pre-existing enforcement rights for state attorneys general, the Dodd-Frank Act gives attorneys general authority to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act s authority. In conducting an investigation, the CFPB or state attorneys general may issue a civil investigative demand requiring a target company to prepare and submit, among other items, documents, written reports, answers to interrogatories, and deposition testimony. If we become subject to investigation, the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the initiation of a CFPB investigation of our company or even the perception that such an investigation could occur, even in the absence of any finding by the CFPB that we have violated any state or federal law. 
 Although many of the regulations implementing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been promulgated, we are still unable to predict how this significant legislation may be interpreted and enforced or the full extent to which implementing regulations and supervisory policies may affect it. The President and current Congress may impact the extent to which new or revised legislation or regulations are adopted, and whether provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and rules promulgated thereunder, including those provisions establishing the CFPB and the rules and regulations proposed and enacted by the CFPB, may be revised, repealed, or amended. There can be no assurance that future reforms will not significantly and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We sell certain of our loans, including, in some instances, charged-off loans and loans where the borrower is in default, which could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses, and/or limit or impede our collection activity. 
 As part of our business model, we have purchased and sold, and may in the future purchase and sell, some of our finance receivables, including loans that have been charged-off and loans where the borrower is in default. The CFPB and other regulators recently have significantly increased their scrutiny of debt buyers and sales, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has criticized and/or penalized sellers of debt for insufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also criticized and/or penalized debt collectors for, among other things, impermissible collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt, not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt, and failing to obtain or maintain proper licenses. Accordingly, our sales of loans could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the loans 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 33 

underlying the transactions, or if we or purchasers of our loans use collection methods that are viewed as unfair, deceptive, or abusive , or if purchasers of our loans fail to obtain or maintain proper licenses . 
 Our use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention. 
 The CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to oversee their business relationships with service providers in a manner that ensures such service providers comply with applicable law. This results in increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We are subject to government regulations concerning our hourly and our other employees, including minimum wage, overtime, and health care laws. 
 We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage and break requirements, pay transparency, leave requirements, health benefits, unemployment and sales taxes, overtime, and working conditions and immigration status. Legislated increases in the federal and state minimum wage and increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Unionizing and collective bargaining efforts have received increased attention nationwide in recent periods. Should our employees become represented by unions, we would be obligated to bargain with those unions with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which is likely to increase our labor costs. Moreover, as part of the process of union organizing and collective bargaining, strikes and other work stoppages may occur, which would cause disruption to our business. Similarly, many employers nationally in similar retail environments have been subject to actions brought by governmental agencies and private individuals under wage-hour laws on a variety of claims, such as improper classification of workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements and failure to pay overtime wages properly, with such actions sometimes brought as class actions. These actions can result in material liabilities and expenses. Should we be subject to employment litigation, such as actions involving wage-hour, overtime, break, and working time, it may distract our management from business matters and result in increased labor costs. In addition, we currently sponsor employer-subsidized premiums for major medical programs for eligible personnel who elect health care coverage through our insurance programs. As a result of regulatory changes, we may not be able to continue to offer health care coverage to our employees on affordable terms or at all and subsequently may face increased difficulty in hiring and retaining employees. If we are unable to locate, attract, train, or retain qualified personnel, or if our costs of labor increase significantly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Our stock price or results of operations could be adversely affected by media and public perception of installment loans and of legislative and regulatory developments affecting activities within the installment lending sector. 
 Consumer advocacy groups and various media sources continue to criticize alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops). These critics frequently characterize such alternative financial services providers as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If these persons were to criticize the products that we offer, it could result in further regulation of our business and could negatively impact our relationships with existing borrowers and efforts to attract new borrowers. Furthermore, our industry is highly regulated, and announcements regarding new or expected governmental and regulatory action in the alternative financial services sector may adversely impact our stock price and perceptions of our business even if such actions are not targeted at our operations and do not directly impact us. 
 Legal proceedings to which we may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Like many companies in our industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by borrowers and others. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, business expansion, or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 34 

sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment, or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate, or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If in any legal proceeding we incur liability or defense costs that exceed our insurance coverage or that are not within the scope of our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Current and proposed regulation related to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security could increase our costs. 
 We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations in these areas. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions. 
 Federal or state laws issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our company. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act is extensive and significant legislation. It is possible that compliance with the CARES Act may impose costs on, or create operational constraints, for us. Further, certain governmental authorities, including federal, state, or local governments, could enact, and in some cases already have enacted, laws, regulations, executive orders, or other guidance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that allow borrowers to forgo making scheduled payments for some period of time, require modifications to loans (e.g. waiving accrued interest), preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral, or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of our branches or other operations as non-essential businesses or otherwise. Additionally, the CARES Act includes various provisions, such as requirements affecting credit reporting, designed to protect consumers. 
 Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price of shares of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. 
 The market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results and the market price of our common stock could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies, speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in, or individual scandals.

There can be no assurance of our ability to declare and pay cash dividends in future periods. 
 On October 29, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors initiated and declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.20 per share, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 0.25 per share on June 15, 2021 and to 0.30 per share on February 9, 2022. We intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future however, the declaration, amount, and payment of any future cash dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our senior revolving credit facility. A reduction or elimination of our dividend payments in the future could have a negative effect on our stock price. 
 Your stock ownership may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise. 
 We have approximately 986 million shares of common stock authorized but unissued, as of February 22, 2023. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Our stockholders previously approved the Regional Management Corp. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and/or restated, the 2015 Plan ). As of December 31, 2022, subject to adjustments as provided in the 2015 Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan may not exceed the sum of (a) 2,600,000 shares plus (b) any shares remaining available for the grant of awards as of the 2015 Plan effective date under the 2007 Management Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan ), plus (c) any shares subject to an award granted under the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Plan, which award is forfeited, cash-settled, cancelled, terminated, expires, or lapses for any reason without the issuance of shares or pursuant to which such shares are forfeited. We have 772,038 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, as of February 22, 2023. In addition, our Board may recommend in the future that our stockholders approve new stock plans. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and applicable state law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions: 

authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote and 

establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 

 In addition, certain states require the approval of a state regulator for the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than a certain amount of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company. The overall effect of these laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of a nonregulated corporation. 
 Furthermore, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 36 

contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by our non-employee directors and their affiliates. 
 Certain of our non-employee directors and their affiliates are in the business of providing buyout capital and growth capital to developing companies and may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us, on the one hand, and certain of our non-employee directors and their affiliates, on the other hand. As set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, such non-employee directors and their affiliates shall not have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Therefore, a non-employee director of our company may pursue certain acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such non-employee directors to themselves or their other affiliates instead of us.

 Market Information 
 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the symbol RM. 
 Holders 
 As of February 16, 2023, there were 17 registered holders of our common stock. Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to determine the exact number of beneficial stockholders represented by those record holders, but we believe that there were approximately 4,452 beneficial owners of our common stock as of February 16, 2023. 
 Non-Affiliate Ownership 
 For purposes of calculating the aggregate market value of shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates, as set forth on the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have assumed that all outstanding shares are held by non-affiliates, except for shares held by each of our executive officers, directors, and 5 or greater stockholders as of June 30, 2022. In the case of 5 or greater stockholders, we have not deemed such stockholders to be affiliates unless there are facts and circumstances which would indicate that such stockholders exercise any control over our company or unless they hold 10 or more of our outstanding common stock. These assumptions should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all executive officers, directors, and 5 or greater stockholders are, in fact, affiliates of our company, or that there are no other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of our company. Further information concerning shareholdings of our officers, directors, and principal stockholders is incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On February 8, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.30, payable on March 15, 2023, to stockholders of record on February 22, 2023. We currently expect that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future. We anticipate that future dividend declarations will occur in February, May, August, and November, with payment being made in March, June, September, and December. 
 The declaration, amount, and payment of any future cash dividends on shares of common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of cash dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our amended and restated senior revolving credit facility includes a provision restricting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock based upon, among other things, our interest coverage ratio and hypothetical availability under the credit facility. Likewise, certain of our credit facilities restrict certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries from paying dividends to us, subject to certain exceptions.

 Overview 
 We are a diversified consumer finance company that provides installment loan products primarily to customers with limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrifts, credit card companies, and other lenders. As of December 31, 2022, we operate under the name Regional Finance online and in 345 branch locations in 18 states across the United States, serving 517,700 active accounts. Most of our loan products are secured, and each is structured on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis with fully amortizing equal monthly installment payments, repayable at any time without penalty. We source our loans through our omni-channel platform, which includes our branches, centrally-managed direct mail campaigns, digital partners, and our consumer website. We operate an integrated branch model in which nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branch network with the support of centralized sales, underwriting, service, collections, and administrative teams. This provides us with frequent contact with our customers, which we believe improves our credit performance and customer loyalty. Our goal is to consistently grow our finance receivables and to soundly manage our portfolio risk, while providing our customers with attractive and easy-to-understand loan products that serve their varied financial needs. 
 Our products include: 

Small Loans 2,500) As of December 31, 2022, we had 287.0 thousand small installment loans outstanding, representing 481.6 million in net finance receivables. This included 151.0 thousand small loan convenience checks, representing 217.8 million in net finance receivables. 

Large Loans 2,500) As of December 31, 2022, we had 225.6 thousand large installment loans outstanding, representing 1.2 billion in net finance receivables. This included 40.6 thousand large loan convenience checks, representing 140.7 million in net finance receivables. 

Retail Loans As of December 31, 2022, we had 5.1 thousand retail purchase loans outstanding, representing 9.6 million in net finance receivables. 

Optional Insurance Products We offer optional payment and collateral protection insurance to our direct loan customers. 

 Small and large installment loans are our core products and will be the drivers of future growth. We ceased accepting applications for our retail loan product offering in November 2022, to focus on growing our core loan portfolio. We will continue to own and service our existing portfolio of retail loans. Our primary sources of revenue are interest and fee income from our loan products, of which interest and fees relating to small and large installment loans are the largest component. In addition to interest and fee income from loans, we derive revenue from optional insurance products purchased by customers of our direct loan products. 
 For additional information regarding our business operations, see Part I, Item 1, Business. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 42 

Outlook 
 We continually assess the macroeconomic environment in which we operate in order to appropriately and timely adapt to current market conditions. Macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and impacts from current geopolitical events outside the U.S., may affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Current inflationary pressures and rising interest rates have created economic uncertainty and diminished consumer confidence. Recent geopolitical events outside of the U.S. have also contributed to volatility in U.S. markets. As inflation accelerated and geopolitical stability began to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began to proactively tighten our credit models. We have principally focused on tightening certain higher-risk, higher-rate customer segments that have been particularly adversely impacted by a more challenging economic environment. In early 2022, we eliminated one higher-risk, higher-rate digital affiliate and two higher-risk, higher-rate segments within our direct mail program. Loans originated through the eliminated affiliate and direct mail segments contributed 20 basis points to our contractual delinquency rate as of December 31, 2022, and 80 basis points to our net credit loss rate in 2022. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we sold 27.1 million of non-performing loans, 17.5 million of which would have likely been written off in early 2023. The non-performing loan sale allowed us to dispose of a distressed portion of our portfolio at an attractive price and enabled us to re-focus our personnel on earlier-stage delinquent accounts as we enter the first quarter tax season, which seasonally is our best quarter for collections. As a result of the loan sale, our net income was negatively impacted by 2.7 million in 2022, but net income will be positively impacted by a similar amount in 2023. The loan sale impact on total revenue was a decrease of 2.2 million from revenue reversals, and the impact on the provision for credit losses was an increase of 1.3 million. The loan sale resulted in additional net credit losses of 13.1 million. Our allowance for credit losses decreased 11.8 million as a result of the loan sale because reserves were released for the sold loans and portfolio composition changes. 
 Our allowance for credit losses was 10.5 of net finance receivables as of December 31, 2022 and included 20.7 million of reserves associated with estimated future macroeconomic impacts on credit losses. Our contractual delinquency as a percentage of net finance receivables was 7.1 as of December 31, 2022, up from 6.0 as of December 31, 2021. Going forward, we may experience changes to the macroeconomic assumptions within our forecast and changes to our credit loss performance outlook, both of which could lead to further changes in our allowance for credit losses, reserve rate, and provision for credit losses expense. 
 We proactively diversified our funding over the past few years and continue to maintain a strong liquidity profile. As of December 31, 2022, we had 101.4 million of available liquidity, comprised of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we had 555.1 million of unused capacity on our revolving credit facilities (subject to the borrowing base) as of December 31, 2022. We believe our liquidity position provides substantial runway to fund our growth initiatives and to support the fundamental operations of our business. 
 Online operations continue to be an important part of our customer acquisition strategy, including remote loan closings in recent years. On the digital front, we continue to build and expand upon our end-to-end online and mobile origination capabilities for new and existing customers, along with additional digital servicing functionality. Combined with remote loan closings, we believe that these omni-channel sales and servicing capabilities will continue to expand the market reach of our branches, increase our average branch receivables, and improve our revenues and operating efficiencies, while at the same time increasing customer satisfaction. 
 Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Our business is impacted by several factors affecting our revenues, costs, and results of operations, including the following: 
 Quarterly Information and Seasonality . Our loan volume and contractual delinquency follow seasonal trends. Demand for our loans is typically highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which we believe is largely due to customers borrowing money for vacation, back-to-school, and holiday spending. Loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter, which we believe is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. Delinquencies generally reach their lowest point in the first half of the year and rise in the second half of the year. Changes in quarterly growth or liquidation could result in larger allowance for credit loss releases in periods of portfolio liquidation, and larger provisions for credit losses in periods of portfolio growth. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our operating results. However, changes in macroeconomic factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflict, have impacted our typical seasonal trends for loan volume and delinquency. 
 Growth in Loan Portfolio. The revenue that we derive from interest and fees is largely driven by the balance of loans that we originate. Average net finance receivables were 1.5 billion in 2022 and 1.2 billion in 2021. We source our loans through our 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 43 

branches, centrally-managed direct mail program, digital partners, and our consumer website. Nearly all loans , regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branches . Increasing the number of loans per branch and growing our state footprint allows us to increase the number of customers that we are able to serve. We grew our state footprint from 13 to 1 8 states during 2022, expanding our operations to Mississippi, Indiana, California , Louisiana , and Idaho. We expect to expan d into one additional state in the first quarter of 2023, and we may enter a second new state in the second half of the year, if justified by the economic conditions. We continue to assess our legacy branch network for clear opportunities to consolidate operations into larger branches within close geographic proximity. This branch optimization is consistent with our omni-channel strategy and builds upon our recent successes in entering new states with a lighter branch footprint, while still providing customers with best-in-class service. We plan to add additional branches in new and existing states where it is favorable for us to conduct business. 
 Product Mix. We are exposed to different credit risks and charge different interest rates and fees with respect to the various types of loans we offer. Our product mix also varies to some extent by state, and we may further diversify our product mix in the future. The interest rates and fees vary from state to state, depending on the competitive environment and relevant laws and regulations. 
 Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses. Our results of operations are highly dependent upon the credit quality of our loan portfolio. The credit quality of our loan portfolio is the result of our ability to enforce sound underwriting standards, maintain diligent servicing of the portfolio, and respond to changing economic conditions as we grow our loan portfolio. 
 The primary underlying factors driving the provision for credit losses for each loan type are our underwriting standards, delinquency trends, the general economic conditions in the areas in which we conduct business, loan portfolio growth, and the effectiveness of our servicing and collection efforts. We monitor these factors, and the amount and past due status of all loans, to identify trends that might require us to modify the allowance for credit losses. 
 Interest Rates. Our costs of funds are affected by changes in interest rates, as the interest rates that we pay on certain of our credit facilities are variable. As a component of our strategy to manage the interest rate risk associated with future interest payments on our variable-rate debt, a majority of our funding was held at a fixed rate as of December 31, 2022, representing 88 of total debt. An additional component of our strategy was to purchase interest rate cap contracts, which were all sold during 2022. See Note 10, Interest Rate Caps of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our interest rate caps. 
 Operating Costs. Our financial results are impacted by the costs of operations and head office functions. Those costs are included in general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Interest and Fee Income. Our interest and fee income consists primarily of interest earned on outstanding loans. Accrual of interest income on finance receivables is suspended when an account becomes 90 days delinquent. If the account is charged off, the accrued interest income is reversed as a reduction of interest and fee income. 
 Most states allow certain fees in connection with lending activities, such as loan origination fees, acquisition fees, and maintenance fees. Some states allow for higher fees while keeping interest rates lower. Loan fees are additional charges to the customer and generally are included in the annual percentage rate shown in the Truth in Lending disclosure that we make to our customers. The fees may or may not be refundable to the customer in the event of an early payoff, depending on state law. Fees are recognized as income over the life of the loan on the constant yield method. 
 Insurance Income, Net. Our insurance operations are a material part of our overall business and are integral to our lending activities. Insurance income, net consists primarily of earned premiums, net of certain direct costs, from the sale of various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products offered to customers who obtain loans directly from us. Insurance income, net also includes the earned premiums and direct costs associated with the non-file insurance that we purchase to protect us from credit losses where, following an event of default, we are unable to take possession of personal property collateral because our security interest is not perfected. We do not sell insurance to non-borrowers. Direct costs included in insurance income, net are claims paid, claims reserves, ceding fees, and premium taxes paid. We do not allocate to insurance income, net, any other head office or branch administrative costs associated with management of insurance operations, management of our captive insurance company, marketing and selling insurance products, legal and compliance review, or internal audits. 
 As reinsurer, we maintain restricted reserves comprised of restricted cash and restricted available-for-sale investments for life insurance claims in an amount determined by the unaffiliated insurance company. As of December 31, 2022, the restricted reserves 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 44 

consisted of 21.2 million of unearned premium reserves , including 1.1 million of unpaid claims reserves . The unaffiliated insurance company maintains the reserves for non-life claims. 
 Other Income. Our other income consists primarily of late charges assessed on customers who fail to make a payment within a specified number of days following the due date of the payment. In addition, fees for extending the due date of a loan, returned check charges, commissions earned from the sale of an auto club product, interest income from restricted cash, and investment income from restricted available-for-sale securities are included in other income. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income in amounts that we estimate as sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to provide for lifetime expected credit losses on the related finance receivable portfolio. Credit loss experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, delinquency of finance receivables, loan portfolio growth, the value of underlying collateral, and management s judgment are factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance and the resulting provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses fluctuates so that we maintain an adequate credit loss allowance that reflects lifetime expected credit losses for each finance receivable type. Changes in our delinquency and net credit loss ratio (net credit losses divided by average net finance receivables) may result in changes to our provision for credit losses. Substantial adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in forecasted economic conditions or loan portfolio performance. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. Our financial results are impacted by the costs of operations and head office functions. Those costs are included in general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Our general and administrative expenses are comprised of four categories: personnel, occupancy, marketing, and other. We measure our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average net finance receivables, which we refer to as our operating expense ratio. 
 Our personnel expenses are the largest component of our general and administrative expenses and consist primarily of the salaries and wages, overtime, contract labor, relocation costs, incentives, benefits, and related payroll taxes associated with all of our operations and head office employees. 
 Our occupancy expenses consist primarily of the cost of renting our facilities, all of which are leased, and the utility, depreciation of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures, communication services, data processing, and other non-personnel costs associated with operating our business. 
 Our marketing expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our direct mail campaigns (including postage and costs associated with selecting recipients), digital marketing, maintaining our consumer website, and some local marketing by branches. These costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Other expenses consist primarily of legal, compliance, audit, and consulting costs, as well as software maintenance and support, non-employee director compensation, electronic payment processing costs, bank service charges, office supplies, credit bureau charges, and the amortization of software, software licenses, and implementation costs. We frequently experience fluctuations in other expenses as we grow our loan portfolio and expand our market footprint. For a discussion regarding how risks and uncertainties associated with the current regulatory environment may impact our future expenses, net income, and overall financial condition, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 Interest Expense. Our interest expense consists primarily of paid and accrued interest for debt, unused line fees, and amortization of debt issuance costs on debt. Interest expense also includes changes in the fair value of interest rate caps. 
 Income Taxes. Income taxes consist of state and federal income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period in which the change occurs, and the effects of future tax rate changes are recognized in the period in which the enactment of new rates occurs.

 Comparison of December 31, 2022, Versus December 31, 2021 
 The following discussion and table describe the changes in finance receivables by product type: 

Small Loans 2,500) Small loans outstanding increased by 36.6 million, or 8.2 , to 481.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 445.0 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was the result of new growth initiatives, and increased marketing, partially offset by credit tightening for disciplined growth. 

Large Loans 2,500) Large loans outstanding increased by 237.5 million, or 24.5 , to 1.2 billion at December 31, 2022, from 970.7 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to new growth initiatives, increased marketing, and the transition of small loan customers to large loans, partially offset by credit tightening for disciplined growth. 

Retail Loans Retail loans outstanding decreased 0.9 million, or 8.9 , to 9.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 10.5 million at December 31, 2021. We ceased accepting applications for our retail loan product offering as of November 2022 to focus on growing our core loan portfolio.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2022, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Net Income. Net income decreased 37.5 million, or 42.2 , to 51.2 million in 2022, from 88.7 million in 2021. The decrease was due to an increase in provision for credit losses of 96.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of 27.0 million, and an increase in interest expense of 2.9 million, partially offset by an increase in revenue of 78.8 million and a decrease in income taxes of 9.7 million. 
 Revenue. Total revenue increased 78.8 million, or 18.4 , to 507.2 million in 2022, from 428.4 million in 2021. The components of revenue are explained in greater detail below. 
 Interest and Fee Income . Interest and fee income increased 68.3 million, or 17.9 , to 450.9 million in 2022, from 382.5 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 26.1 increase in average net finance receivables, offset by a 2.0 decrease in average yield. Interest accrual reversal of charged-off loans from the loan sale decreased interest and fee income by 1.9 million, which contributed 10 basis points to the decrease in average yield.

Small and large loan yields decreased 3.0 and 1.3 , respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to normalization of credit performance across the portfolio, the economic environment, credit tightening on higher-rate loans, and our portfolio composition shift toward larger, higher-credit quality customers with lower interest rates. As a result of the rising interest rate environment and normalizing credit, we began to re-price parts of our portfolio in the second half of 2022. 
 Total originations increased to 1.6 billion in 2022, from 1.5 billion in 2021 , despite credit-tightening actions and the re-allocation of labor to collections, both of which impacted origination levels in 2022. The following table represents the principal balance of loans originated and refinanced:

The 68.3 million increase in interest and fee income in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by growth of our average net finance receivables. This benefit was partially offset by credit tightening on higher-rate loans, the intended product mix 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 47 

shift toward large loans, the economic environment , and the portfolio composition shift toward higher - credit quality customers with lower interest rates. 
 Insurance Income, Net . Insurance income, net increased 8.0 million, or 22.6 , to 43.5 million in 2022, from 35.5 million in 2021. The increase was inclusive of revenue reversals of 0.3 million resulting from the loan sale. In both 2022 and 2021, personal property insurance premiums represented the largest component of aggregate earned insurance premiums, and life insurance claims expense represented the largest component of direct insurance expenses. 
 The following table summarizes the components of insurance income, net:

Earned premiums during 2022 increased by 7.0 million, and claims, reserves, and certain direct expenses decreased by 1.0 million compared to 2021. The increase in earned premiums was primarily due to portfolio growth. The decrease in claims, reserves, and certain direct expenses compared to 2021 was primarily due to decreases in life insurance claims. 
 Other Income . Other income increased 2.5 million, or 24.3 , to 12.8 million in 2022, from 10.3 million during 2021, primarily due to an increase in interest income from cash reserves of 1.7 million and an increase in late charges of 1.5 million from portfolio growth, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our auto club product of 0.8 million. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. Our provision for credit losses increased 96.1 million, or 108.0 , to 185.1 million in 2022, from 89.0 million in 2021. The increase was due to an increase in net credit losses of 85.9 million and an increase in the allowance for credit losses of 10.2 million compared to the prior-year period. Certain segments of our higher-risk, higher-rate customers were particularly adversely impacted by inflation in 2022. Earlier in 2022, we eliminated one higher-risk, higher-rate digital affiliate and two higher-risk, higher-rate segments within our direct mail program. Loans originated through the eliminated affiliate and direct mail segments contributed 20 basis points to our contractual delinquency rate as of December 31, 2022, and 80 basis points to our net credit loss ratio in 2022. The increase in the provision for credit losses is explained in greater detail below. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. We evaluate delinquency and losses in each of our loan products in establishing the allowance for credit losses. The following table sets forth our allowance for credit losses compared to the related finance receivables as of the end of the periods indicated:

As of December 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses included 20.7 million of reserves associated with estimated future macroeconomic impacts on credit losses. The allowance for credit losses included a build of 15.8 million associated with portfolio growth (inclusive of an 11.8 million release associated with the loan sale during 2022) compared to a build of 25.3 million associated with portfolio growth in 2021. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables decreased to 10.5 as of December 31, 2022, from 11.2 as of the prior-year period. See Note 4, Finance Receivables, Credit Quality Information, and Allowance for Credit Losses of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information regarding our allowance for credit losses. 
 Net Credit Losses. Net credit losses increased 85.9 million, or 107.8 , to 165.6 million in 2022, from 79.7 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average net finance receivables, credit normalization, the impact of inflation on our customers, and the net credit losses attributable to the loan sale. Net credit losses as a percentage of average net finance receivables were 10.8 in 2022, compared to 6.6 in 2021. Loans originated through the eliminated affiliate and direct mail 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 48 

segments contributed 8 0 basis points to our net credit loss rat io in 2022. The loan sale also increased our net credit loss rat io by 80 basis points in 2022 . 
 Delinquency Performance. Our contractual delinquency as a percentage of net finance receivables increased to 7.1 as of December 31, 2022, from 6.0 as of December 31, 2021, due to the macroeconomic environment, partially offset by the loan sale benefit of 90 basis points. Contractual delinquencies as a percentage of net finance receivables as of December 31, 2022, included a 20 basis point impact from one higher-risk, higher-rate digital affiliate and two higher-risk, higher-rate segments within our direct mail program that were particularly adversely impacted by inflation.

General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses increased 27.0 million, or 13.8 , to 222.5 million in 2022 from 195.5 million in 2021. The absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is explained in greater detail below. 
 Personnel. The largest component of general and administrative expenses is personnel expense, which increased 21.4 million, or 17.9 , to 141.2 million in 2022, from 119.8 million in 2021. We had several offsetting increases and decreases in personnel expenses during 2022. Labor expenses and incentive costs increased 24.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively, compared to 2021. Capitalized loan origination costs, which reduce personnel expenses, increased by 2.6 million compared to 2021 due to an increase in loans originated. 
 Occupancy. Occupancy expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 1.3 , to 23.8 million in 2022, from 24.1 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower branch optimization costs of 0.2 million. 
 Marketing. Marketing expenses increased 1.0 million, or 6.8 , to 15.4 million in 2022, from 14.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher digital marketing costs of 0.9 million and increased activity in our direct mail campaigns of 0.2 million to support growth. 
 Other Expenses. Other expenses increased 4.9 million, or 13.3 , to 42.1 million in 2022, from 37.2 million in 2021, primarily due to increased investment in digital and technological capabilities of 2.4 million and increased travel expenses of 0.9 million. Additionally, we often experience increases in other expenses including legal and settlement expenses, external fraud, collections expense, bank fees, and certain professional expenses as we grow our loan portfolio and expand our market footprint. 
 Operating Expense Ratio. Our operating expense ratio decreased by 1.6 to 14.5 during 2022, from 16.1 during 2021. Our operating expense ratio has declined as we have grown our loan portfolio and controlled expense growth. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 49 

Interest Expense. Interest expense on debt increase d 2.9 million , or 9.2 , to 34.2 million in 2022 , from 31.3 million in 2021 . The in crease was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our debt facilities, partially offset by a decrease in our average cost of debt. The average cost of debt decreased 0. 70 to 2. 89 in 2022, from 3.59 in 2021 , primarily driven by a 10.4 million increase in the fair value of our interest rate caps and partially offset by increased variable rate funding costs . The average balance of our debt facilities increased to 1.2 billion during 2022, from 873.2 million during 2021. 
 Income Taxes. Income taxes decreased 9.7 million, or 40.7 , to 14.1 million in 2022, from 23.8 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 47.2 million decrease in income before taxes compared to 2021. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.6 in 2022, compared to 21.1 in 2021. Fiscal 2022 was impacted by tax benefits from the exercise and vesting of share-based awards and a research and development tax credit. The effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by the tax benefits from the exercise and vesting of share-based awards and amended state tax returns. 
 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2021, Versus the Year Ended December 31, 2020 
 For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2022), which is incorporated by reference herein. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash needs relate to the funding of our lending activities and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to improving our technology infrastructure and expanding and maintaining our branch locations. We have historically financed, and plan to continue to finance, our short-term and long-term operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our debt facilities, including our senior revolving credit facility, revolving warehouse credit facilities, and asset-backed securitization transactions, all of which are described below. We continue to seek ways to diversify our funding sources. As of December 31, 2022, we had a funded debt-to-equity ratio (debt divided by total stockholders equity) of 4.4 to 1.0 and a stockholders equity ratio (total stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets) of 17.9 . 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased to 3.9 million as of December 31, 2022, from 10.5 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 we had 97.6 million and 199.2 million, respectively, of immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities. Our unused capacity on our revolving credit facilities (subject to the borrowing base) was 555.1 million and 556.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our total debt increased to 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, from 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021.

Based upon anticipated cash flows, we believe that cash flows from operations and our various financing alternatives will provide sufficient financing for debt maturities and operations over the next twelve months, as well as into the future. 
 From time to time, we have extended the maturity date of and increased the borrowing limits under our senior revolving credit facility. While we have successfully obtained such extensions and increases in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so if and when needed in the future . In addition, the revolving period maturities of our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities (each as described below within Financing Arrangements range from March 2023 to September 2026. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure an extension of the warehouse credit facilities or close additional securitization transactions if and when needed in the future .

The Board declared and paid 11.8 million of cash dividends on our common stock during 2022. See Note 19, Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information regarding our quarterly cash dividend following the end of the year. 
 While we intend to pay our quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed and declared at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the Board deems relevant. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and the Board may choose not to continue to declare dividends in the future. 
 Cash Flow. 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was 224.3 million, compared to 189.0 million provided by operating activities in 2021, an increase of 35.3 million. The increase was primarily due to the growth in our business described above, which produced an increase in net income, before provision for credit losses. 
 Investing Activities. Investing activities consist of originations and repayments of finance receivables, purchases of intangible assets, and purchases of property and equipment for new and existing branches. Net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was 447.3 million, compared to 355.1 million in 2021, an increase in cash used of 92.2 million. The increase in cash used was primarily due to increased originations of finance receivables and the purchase of restricted available-for-sale investments. 
 Financing Activities. Financing activities consist of borrowings and payments on our outstanding indebtedness. In 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 205.6 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 243.4 million in 2021, a decrease of 37.8 million. The decrease in cash provided was the result of a 92.9 million net decrease in advances on debt instruments and an increase in cash dividends of 1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of common stock of 46.8 million, a decrease in taxes paid of 7.0 million, and a decrease in payments for debt issuance costs of 3.3 million. 
 Financing Arrangements. 
 Senior Revolving Credit Facility. In November 2022, we amended and restated our senior revolving credit facility to, among other things, decrease the availability under the facility from 500 million to 420 million. Our debt under the senior revolving credit facility was 147.5 million as of December 31, 2022, and the facility matures in September 2024. Excluding the receivables held by our variable interest entities (each, a VIE ), the senior revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our finance receivables and equity interests of the majority of our subsidiaries. Advances on the senior revolving credit facility are capped at 83 of eligible secured finance receivables . 
 In September 2022, the Company amended and restated its senior revolving credit facility to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for the calculation of interest with a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR or, in certain limited circumstances, another alternative benchmark rate. The one-month LIBOR was replaced on October 1, 2022 by one-month SOFR with a floor of not less than 0.50 . Borrowings under the facility bear interest, payable monthly, at rates equal to one-month SOFR, with a SOFR floor of not less than 0.50 , plus a 3.00 margin and a benchmark adjustment. The effective interest rate was 7.22 at December 31, 2022. We pay an unused line fee between 0.50 and 1.00 based on the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2022, we had 49.2 million of immediate availability to draw down cash under the facility and held 3.9 million in unrestricted cash. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 51 

In advance of its September 2024 maturity date, we intend to extend the maturity date of the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility or take other appropriate action to address repayment upon maturity. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and the filings referenced therein for a discussion of risks related to our amended and restated senior revolving credit facility, including refinancing risk. 
 Variable Interest Entity Debt. As part of our overall funding strategy, we have transferred certain finance receivables to affiliated VIEs for asset-backed financing transactions, including securitizations. The debt arrangements described below are issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, SPEs, which are considered VIEs under GAAP and are consolidated into the financial statements of their primary beneficiary. 
 These debts are supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying collateralized finance receivables. Collections on these finance receivables are remitted to restricted cash collection accounts, which totaled 112.2 million and 107.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash inflows from the finance receivables are distributed to the lenders/investors, the service providers, and/or the residual interest that we own in accordance with a monthly contractual priority of payments. The SPEs pay a servicing fee to us, which is eliminated in consolidation. Distribution from the SPEs to the Company are permitted under the debt arrangements. 
 At each sale of receivables from our affiliates to the SPEs, we make certain representations and warranties about the quality and nature of the collateralized receivables. The debt arrangements require us to repurchase the receivables in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which the representations and warranties made by us concerning the quality and characteristics of the receivables are inaccurate. Assets transferred to SPEs are legally isolated from us and our affiliates, and the claims of our and our affiliates creditors. Further, the assets of each SPE are owned by such SPE and are not available to satisfy the debts or other obligations of us or any of our affiliates. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and the filings referenced therein for a discussion of risks related to our variable interest entity debt.

The debt is secured by finance receivables and other related assets that we purchased from our affiliates, which we then sold and transferred to RMR II. 
 In September 2022, the Company and its wholly-owned SPE, RMR II, amended and restated the credit agreement that provides for a revolving warehouse credit facility to RMR II to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for calculation of interest rate with a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR or, in certain limited circumstances, another alternative benchmark rate. The three-month LIBOR was replaced on October 1, 2022 by three-month SOFR with a floor of 0.25 , plus a 2.35 margin and a benchmark adjustment. The effective interest rate was 7.00 at December 31, 2022. RMR II pays an unused commitment fee between 0.35 and 0.85 based upon the average daily utilization of the facility.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the consumer finance industry. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods indicated in the financial statements. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses is based on historical credit experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The historical loss experience is adjusted for quantitative and qualitative factors that are not fully reflected in the historical data. In determining our estimate of expected credit losses, we evaluate information related to credit metrics, changes in our lending strategies and underwriting practices, and the current and forecasted direction of the economic and business environment. These metrics include, but are not limited to, loan portfolio mix and growth, unemployment, credit loss trends, delinquency trends, changes in underwriting, and operational risks. 
 We selected a static pool Probability of Default PD / Loss Given Default LGD model to estimate our base allowance for credit losses, in which the estimated loss is equal to the product of PD and LGD. Historical static pools of net finance receivables are tracked over the term of the pools to identify the incidences of loss (PDs) and the average severity of losses (LGDs). 
 To enhance the precision of the allowance for credit loss estimate, we evaluate our finance receivable portfolio on a pool basis and segment each pool of finance receivables with similar credit risk characteristics. As part of our evaluation, we consider loan portfolio characteristics such as product type, loan size, loan term, internal or external credit scores, delinquency status, geographical location, and vintage. Based on analysis of historical loss experience, we selected the following segmentation: product type, Fair Isaac Corporation score, and delinquency status. 
 As finance receivables are originated, provisions for credit losses are recorded in amounts sufficient to maintain an allowance for credit losses at an adequate level to provide for estimated losses over the contractual life of the finance receivables (considering the effect of prepayments). Subsequent changes to the contractual terms that are a result of re-underwriting are not included in the finance receivable s contractual life (considering the effect of prepayments). We use our segmentation loss experience to forecast expected credit losses. Historical information about losses generally provides a basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. We also consider the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which current conditions differ from the conditions 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 55 

that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. These adjustments to historical loss information may be qualitative or quantitative in nature. 
 Macroeconomic forecasts are required for our allowance for credit loss model and require significant judgment and estimation uncertainty. We consider key economic factors, most notably unemployment rates, to incorporate into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. We engaged a major rating service provider to assist with compiling a reasonable and supportable forecast which we use to support the adjustments of our historical loss experience. 
 Due to the judgment and uncertainty in estimating the expected credit losses, we may experience changes to the macroeconomic assumptions within our forecast, as well as changes to our credit loss performance outlook, both of which could lead to further changes in our allowance for credit losses, allowance as a percentage of net finance receivables, and provision for credit losses. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had 20.7 million and 17.0 million in macroeconomic reserves, respectively. Potential macroeconomic changes have created conditions that increase the level of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future credit losses from our loan portfolio. 
 Macroeconomic Sensitivity. To demonstrate the sensitivity of forecasting macroeconomic conditions, we stressed our macroeconomic model with 10 increased weighting towards moderate recession that would have increased our reserves as of December 31, 2022 by 0.9 million. 
 The macroeconomic scenarios are highly influenced by timing, severity, and duration of changes in the underlying economic factors. This makes it difficult to estimate how potential changes in economic factors affect the estimated credit losses. Therefore, this hypothetical analysis is not intended to represent our expectation of changes in our estimate of expected credit losses due to a change in the macroeconomic environment, nor does it consider management s judgment of other quantitative and qualitative information which could increase or decrease the estimate.

ITEM 7A. 
 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect our results of operations and financial condition. We originate finance receivables either at prevailing market rates or at statutory limits. Our finance receivables are structured on a fixed-rate, fixed-term basis. Accordingly, subject to statutory limits, our ability to react to changes in prevailing market rates is dependent upon the speed at which our customers pay off or renew loans in our existing loan portfolio, which allows us to originate new loans at prevailing market rates. Because our large loans have longer maturities than our small loans and typically renew at a slower rate than our small loans, our reaction time to changes may be affected as our large loans change as a percentage of our portfolio. 
 We also are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of certain borrowing activities. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rates on 88 of our debt (the securitizations) were fixed. We maintain liquidity and fund our business operations in part through variable-rate borrowings under a senior revolving credit facility and three revolving warehouse credit facilities. In September 2022, we amended and restated our senior, RMR II warehouse, and RMR IV warehouse revolving credit facilities, transitioning the benchmark rate for the calculation of interest with a forward-looking term rate from LIBOR to SOFR, effective on October 1, 2022. See Note 11, Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information regarding the September 2022 amendments and transition of the benchmark rates.

We previously purchased interest rate caps to manage the risk associated with LIBOR-based borrowings. These interest rate caps were based on the one-month LIBOR and reimbursed us for the difference when the one-month LIBOR exceeded the strike rate. 
 In April 2022, we collateralized our interest rate caps. Subsequently, we sold our shorter-duration interest rate cap contracts with a fair value of 14.7 million. These sold interest rate caps had an aggregate notional principal amount of 450.0 million and maturity dates ranging from March 2023 through June 2024. In August 2022, we sold our remaining interest rate caps with a fair value of 5.0 million, having an aggregate notional principal amount of 100.0 million and maturing in 2026. As of December 31, 2022, we no longer maintained interest rate cap protection. 
 Based on the underlying rates and the outstanding balances at December 31, 2022, an increase of 100 basis points in the rates of our revolving credit facilities would result in approximately 1.7 million of increased interest expense on an annual basis, in the aggregate, under these borrowings. 
 The nature and amount of our debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.

 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regional Management Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Regional Management Corp. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
 The Company s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company s loan portfolio is recorded in the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on historical credit experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The historical loss experience is adjusted for quantitative and qualitative factors that are not fully reflected in the historical data. In determining its estimate of expected credit losses, the Company evaluates information related to credit metrics, changes in its lending strategies and underwriting practices, and the current and forecasted direction of the economic and business environment. These metrics include, but are not limited to, loan portfolio mix and growth, unemployment, credit loss trends, delinquency trends, changes in underwriting, and operational risks. 
 The Company selected a static pool Probability of Default PD / Loss Given Default LGD model to estimate its base allowance for credit losses, in which the estimated loss is equal to the product of PD and LGD. Historical static pools of net finance receivables are tracked over the term of the pools to identify the incidences of loss (PDs) and the average severity of losses (LGDs). To enhance the precision of the allowance for credit loss estimate, the Company evaluates its finance receivable portfolio on a pool basis and segments each pool of finance receivables with similar credit risk characteristics. As part of its evaluation, the Company considers loan portfolio characteristics such as product type, loan size, loan term, internal or external credit scores, delinquency status, geographical location, and vintage. Based on analysis of historical loss experience, the Company selected the following segmentation: product type, Fair Isaac Corporation FICO score, and delinquency status. 
 
 Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 59 

Historical information about losses generally provides a basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. The Company also considers the need to adjust historical information to reflect the extent to which current conditions differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated. These adjustments to historical loss information may be qualitative or quantitative in nature. 
 Reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts are required for the Company s allowance for credit loss model. The Company engaged a major rating service to assist with compiling a reasonable and supportable forecast. The Company reviews macroeconomic forecasts to use in its allowance for credit losses. The Company adjusts the historical loss experience by relevant qualitative factors for these expectations. 
 Given the size of the loan portfolio and the subjective nature of estimating the allowance for credit losses, auditing the allowance for credit losses involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses included the following, among others: 

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls related to (i) selection of the macroeconomic forecasts, (ii) execution and monitoring of the PG/LGD model, (iii) adjustments made to the historical loss experience for qualitative factors, and (iv) overall calculation and disclosure of the allowance for credit losses. 

We used our credit specialists to assist us in (i) evaluating the reasonableness of the PG/LGD model and certain assumptions, and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of design, theory, and logic of the model for estimating expected credit losses. 

We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data input into the models and assessed the reasonableness of the model s calculations of probability of default and loss given default. 

We (i) evaluated the reasonableness of management s macroeconomic forecast selection, (ii) evaluated the appropriateness and relevance of adjustments made to the historical loss experience for qualitative factors, and (iii) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of these adjustments. 

We tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the overall allowance for credit losses and assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Regional Management Corp. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Regional Management Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Auditor s Unqualified Report on Financial Statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Regional Management Corp. and Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Regional Management Corp. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 As described in Note 2 and Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company established an allowance for credit losses of 159.3 million as of December 31, 2021, under the current expected credit losses (CECL) model. The allowance for credit losses consists of a base component in which the credit losses for finance receivables are estimated on a collective basis using the static pool Probability of Default/Loss Given Default model segmented by loan product type, credit score, and delinquency status. The Company s base component of the allowance for credit losses also accounts for certain finance receivables that have been modified by bankruptcy proceedings or company loss mitigation policies using a discounted cash flows approach. The base component of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted for quantitative and qualitative factors related to credit metrics, including but not limited to, loan portfolio mix and growth, unemployment, credit loss trends, delinquency trends, changes in lending strategies and underwriting practices, and operational risks, as well as the current and forecasted direction of the economic and business environment. These adjustments to the base component are determined by management to involve a higher degree of complexity due to the significant judgements surrounding the macroeconomic forecasts and other qualitative factors. 
 
 We identified the Company s macroeconomic forecasts and other qualitative factors of the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management and the fact that the estimates related to macroeconomic and qualitative factors are highly sensitive to changes in the underlying data and assumptions. Significant auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company s estimates and assumptions related to the significant judgments surrounding the macroeconomic forecasts and other qualitative factors of the allowance for credit losses. 

Regional Management Corp. | 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 62 

The primary audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among others: 

Obtaining an understanding of the relevant controls related to: (a) management s validation of the macroeconomic forecast spread and scenarios, (b) management s validation of the qualitative factor inputs, and (c) management s validation of the calculations, and our testing of such controls for design and operating effectiveness. 

Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining macroeconomic forecast and qualitative factor adjustments by agreeing them to internal and external source data. 

Evaluating the current and forecasted direction and magnitude of the economic and business environment identified by the Company, adjusted for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, for reasonableness in relation to internal and external source data provided. 

Evaluating the direction and magnitude of other qualitative factor adjustments related to credit metrics, including but not limited to, loan portfolio mix and growth, unemployment, credit loss trends, delinquency trends, changes in lending strategies and underwriting practices, and operational risks identified by the Company for reasonableness in relation to internal and external source data provided.

 The Company s loan volume and contractual delinquency follow seasonal trends. Demand for the Company s small and large loans is typically highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which the Company believes is largely due to customers borrowing money for vacation, back-to-school, and holiday spending. Loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter, which the Company believes is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. Delinquencies generally reach their lowest point in the first half of the year and rise in the second half of the year. Changes in quarterly growth or liquidation could result in larger allowance for credit loss releases in periods of portfolio liquidation, and larger provisions for credit losses in periods of portfolio growth. Consequently, the Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its operating results. However, changes in macroeconomic factors, including inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflict, have impacted the Company s typical seasonal trends for loan volume and delinquency. reportable segment, which is the consumer finance segment.

As of the effective date of the 2015 Plan (April 22, 2015), there were million shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan, inclusive of shares previously available for grant under the 2007 Plan and the 2011 Plan that were rolled over to the 2015 Plan . No further grants will be made under the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Plan. However, awards that are outstanding under the 2007 Plan and the 2011 Plan will continue in accordance with their respective terms.

As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized share-based compensation expense to be recognized over future periods approximated million. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of years. Share-based compensation expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the agreement. All share-based compensation is classified as equity awards. 
 The Company allows for the settlement of share-based awards on a net share basis. With net share settlement, the participant does not surrender any cash or shares upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of stock awards or stock units. Rather, the Company withholds the number of shares with a value equivalent to the option exercise price (for stock options) and the statutory tax withholding (for all share-based awards). Net share settlements have the effect of reducing the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of exercise or vesting.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, accuracy, and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP and include amounts based on judgments and estimates by management. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by internal audits, appropriate reviews by management, policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and codes of ethics adopted by our Company s Board that are applicable to all directors, officers, and employees of our Company. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, no matter how well designed, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as of December 31, 2022. In conducting this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Deloitte & Touche, LLP, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Section 1.05. Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification . The interest rate on Loans may be determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate LIBOR is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority FCA publicly announced that: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; and immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments. Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, Section 2.18(b) and (c) provide the mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.18(e ), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to LIBOR or other rates in the definition of LIBO Rate or with respect

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person or to file a refund or claim.

 (a) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the Borrower except as required by Applicable Law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and 
 
 LEGAL 02/40496567 02/41783784 v 13 7

 LEGAL02/42659188v3 

otherwise apply all or any part of the Loans Outstanding, any Interest accrued thereon and or any other amount due and owing to any Secured Party against amounts payable to the Borrower from the Accounts or any part of such Accounts in accordance with and subject to the priorities required by Section 2.07 . 
 (b) The Administrative Agent may take any action permitted under the Basic Documents and may exercise at the Borrower s sole expense any and all rights and remedies of the Borrower under or in connection with the Collateral, including directing that Collections be deposited into an account specified by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) (rather than to the Collection Account). 
 (c) Consistent with the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (and except as otherwise required by the UCC), the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as specified below, foreclose on the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, solicit and accept bids for and sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker s board or at the Administrative Agent s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable and the Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral to any amounts payable by the Borrower with respect to the Obligations in accordance with the priorities required by Section 2.07 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, at the direction of the Required Lenders following an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(a)(i) or 9.01(a)(ii) , unless: (A) 66 2/3 of the Lenders consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation will be sufficient to pay in full the Loans Outstanding and all accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans Outstanding or (C) the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal and interest on the Loans as they would have become due if the Loans had not been declared immediately due and payable, and the Administrative Agent obtains the consent of the Required Lenders. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above, the Administrative Agent may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as of the sufficiency of the Collateral for such purpose. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by Applicable Law, at least seven Business Days notice to the Borrower (with a copy to each Secured Party) of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Every such sale shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever of the Borrower in and to the Collateral so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against the Borrower or any Person claiming the Collateral sold through the Borrower and its successors or assigns. 
 (d) Upon the completion of any sale under Section 9.02(c) , the Borrower will deliver or cause to be delivered all of the Collateral sold to the purchaser or purchasers at such sale on the date of sale, or within a reasonable time thereafter if it shall be impractical to make immediate delivery, but in any event full title and right of possession to such property shall pass to such purchaser or purchasers forthwith upon the completion of such sale. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent or by any purchaser, the Borrower shall confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to such purchaser all proper instruments of conveyance and transfer and release as may be designated in any such request.

 LEGAL02/42659188v3 

(e) At any sale under Section 9.02(c) , Regional Management or any Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability therefor. Any Secured Party purchasing property at a sale under Section 9.02(c) may set off the purchase price of such property against amounts owing to such Secured Party in full payment of such purchase price up to the full amount owing to such Secured Party. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may direct the Servicer to direct Collections to an account other than the Lockbox (as defined in Schedule G) or the Collection Account. The Administrative Agent and the Servicer agree to cooperate in good faith to provide the Servicer access to the information relating to the Collections deposited into such account in order for the Servicer to perform its related duties hereunder. 
 Section 9.03. Exercise of Remedies . No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower or the Servicer, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Agent or Secured Party, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Parties would otherwise have pursuant to Applicable Law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 
 Section 9.04. Waiver of Certain Laws . The Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and the Borrower, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such Applicable Laws, and any and all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court

 LEGAL02/42659188v3 

having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the Collateral as an entirety or such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine. 
 Section 9.05. Power of Attorney . The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true and lawful attorney (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and deemed occurrence or declaration of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b) , in connection with the enforcement of the rights and remedies provided for in this Article, including (i) to give any necessary receipts or acquittance for amounts collected or received hereunder, (ii) to make all necessary transfers of the Collateral in connection with any sale or other disposition made pursuant hereto, (iii) to execute and deliver for value all necessary or appropriate bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any such sale or other disposition, the Borrower thereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do hereunder and pursuant hereto and (iv) to sign any agreements, orders or other documents in connection with or pursuant to any Basic Document. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, directly or through a purchaser of any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent or such purchaser all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other instruments as may be designated in any such request. On the Closing Date, the Borrower and Regional Management shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1 and Exhibit F-2, respectively.

 LEGAL02/42658427v2 

(e) If an Agent or Lender is not created or organized under the laws of the United States or a State or is otherwise not a U.S. Person, such Person shall, to the extent that it may then do so under Applicable Law, deliver to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank, on or prior to the date on which such entity becomes an Agent or Lender hereunder and (from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), (i) two executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, or Form W-8IMY accompanied by the relevant certification documents for each beneficial owner (or any successor forms or other certificates or statements which may be required and requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities or Applicable Law), as appropriate, and (ii) two executed originals of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; provided, however, that the delivery of any form or documentation pursuant to this subclause (other than the specific IRS Forms and related documentation (and any successor forms) described in clause (i) above) shall not be required if in the related Agent s or Lender s reasonable judgment the completion, execution or delivery of such form or documentation would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (f) If a payment made to any Agent or Lender under any Basic Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Agent or Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Agent or Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Account Bank, such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Account Bank as may be necessary for the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Agent or Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (g) Each Agent and Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank of its legal inability to do so.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person or to file a refund or claim.

Unless waived by the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall cause Regional Management to (A) cure each such breach in all material respects, such that the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.02(a) or in the Second Tier Purchase Agreement, as applicable, are satisfied with respect to each affected Receivable, (B) reacquire each affected Receivable, for the related Release Price, as provided in the Second Tier Purchase Agreement, or (C) substitute a Substitute Receivable for each such affected Receivable, in each case, by the Payment Date relating to the Collection Period in which the Servicer obtained actual knowledge of the underlying breach with respect to each affected Receivable and (ii) in the event Regional Management has not cured any breach described in Section 5.05(a)(i) by the Payment Date relating to the Collection Period in which the Servicer obtained actual knowledge of the underlying breach with respect to each affected Receivable, Regional Management must repurchase or substitute each such affected Receivable by such date. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed, upon receipt of the Release Price into the Collection Account or upon receipt of a Substitute Receivable in respect of any affected Receivable repurchased or substituted by the Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof, as applicable, to convey to the Borrower, without recourse, representation or warranty, all of its right, title and interest in each such affected Receivable.

Upon the release to the Borrower of such Defaulted Receivable, the Administrative Agent shall automatically and without further action be deemed to transfer, assign and set-over to the Borrower, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Administrative Agent in, to and under such Defaulted Receivable and all future monies due or to become due with respect thereto, all proceeds of such Defaulted Receivable and Liquidation Proceeds relating thereto, all rights to security for any such Defaulted Receivable, and all proceeds and products of the foregoing (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Defaulted Receivable Release Price).

 (a) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the Borrower except as required by Applicable Law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the Loans Outstanding, any Interest accrued thereon and 
 
 LEGAL02/42658427v2 

or any other amount due and owing to any Secured Party against amounts payable to the Borrower from the Accounts or any part of such Accounts in accordance with and subject to the priorities required by Section 2.0 7 . 
 (b) The Administrative Agent may take any action permitted under the Basic Documents and may exercise at the Borrower s sole expense any and all rights and remedies of the Borrower under or in connection with the Collateral, including directing that Collections be deposited into an account specified by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) (rather than to the Collection Account). 
 (c) Consistent with the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (and except as otherwise required by the UCC), the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as specified below, foreclose on the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, solicit and accept bids for and sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker s board or at the Administrative Agent s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable and the Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral to any amounts payable by the Borrower with respect to the Obligations in accordance with the priorities required by Section 2.07 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, at the direction of the Required Lenders following an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(a)(i) or 9.01(a)(ii) , unless: (A) 66 2/3 of the Lenders consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation will be sufficient to pay in full the Loans Outstanding and all accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans Outstanding or (C) the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal and interest on the Loans as they would have become due if the Loans had not been declared immediately due and payable, and the Administrative Agent obtains the consent of the Required Lenders. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above, the Administrative Agent may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as of the sufficiency of the Collateral for such purpose. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by Applicable Law, at least seven Business Days notice to the Borrower (with a copy to each Secured Party) of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Every such sale shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever of the Borrower in and to the Collateral so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against the Borrower or any Person claiming the Collateral sold through the Borrower and its successors or assigns. 
 (d) Upon the completion of any sale under Section 9.02(c) , the Borrower will deliver or cause to be delivered all of the Collateral sold to the purchaser or purchasers at 
 
 LEGAL02/42658427v2 

such sale on the date of sale, or within a reasonable time thereafter if it shall be impractical to make immediate delivery, but in any event full title and right of possession to such property shall pass to such purchaser or purchasers forthwith upon the completion of such sale. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent or by any purchaser, the Borrower shall confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to such purchaser all proper instruments of conveyance and transfer and release as may be designated in any such request. 
 (e) At any sale under Section 9.02(c) , Regional Management or any Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability therefor. Any Secured Party purchasing property at a sale under Section 9.02(c) may set off the purchase price of such property against amounts owing to such Secured Party in full payment of such purchase price up to the full amount owing to such Secured Party. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may direct the Servicer to direct Collections to an account other than the Lockbox (as defined in Schedule G) or the Collection Account. The Administrative Agent and the Servicer agree to cooperate in good faith to provide the Servicer access to the information relating to the Collections deposited into such account in order for the Servicer to perform its related duties hereunder. 
 Section 9.03. Exercise of Remedies . No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower or the Servicer, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Agent or Secured Party, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Parties would otherwise have pursuant to Applicable Law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 
 Section 9.04. Waiver of Certain Laws . The Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and the Borrower, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such Applicable Laws, and any and all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the 
 
 LEGAL02/42658427v2 

Collateral as an entirety or such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine. 
 Section 9.05. Power of Attorney . The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true and lawful attorney (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and deemed occurrence or declaration of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b) , in connection with the enforcement of the rights and remedies provided for in this Article, including (i) to give any necessary receipts or acquittance for amounts collected or received hereunder, (ii) to make all necessary transfers of the Collateral in connection with any sale or other disposition made pursuant hereto, (iii) to execute and deliver for value all necessary or appropriate bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any such sale or other disposition, the Borrower thereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do hereunder and pursuant hereto and (iv) to sign any agreements, orders or other documents in connection with or pursuant to any Basic Document. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, directly or through a purchaser of any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent or such purchaser all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other instruments as may be designated in any such request. On the Closing Date, the Borrower and Regional Management shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1 and Exhibit F-2, respectively.

Each of the Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Lender, the Backup Servicer and any Successor Servicer agrees that because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information any breach of this Agreement may cause the Borrower, Regional Management and their respective Affiliates irreparable harm and money damages and other remedies available at law in the event of a breach may not be adequate to compensate the Borrower, Regional Management and their Affiliates for any such breach.

The Administrative Agent, each Lender, the Backup Servicer and any Successor Servicer may disclose, without liability hereunder, that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that it is legally compelled to disclose; provided that it agrees to use reasonable efforts, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower and Regional Management, to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information by the person or persons to whom it was disclosed. 
 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that the Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Lender, the Backup Servicer and any Successor Servicer or their Affiliates may be required to disclose (and may so disclose) the Confidential Information or portions thereof at the request of a Governmental Authority or in connection with an examination of it or its Affiliates by a Governmental Authority, including in connection with the regulator compliance policy of Administrative Agent, any Agent, any Lender, the Backup Servicer and any Successor Servicer. No notice shall be required in connection with any disclosures made pursuant to any request or examination by any Governmental Authority. 
 (h) It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Servicer, the Borrower, the Backup Servicer, the Successor Servicer, the Administrative Agent, any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person or to file a refund or claim.

 (a) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the Borrower except as required by Applicable Law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the Loans Outstanding, any Interest accrued thereon and 
 
 LEGAL02/41783784v7 

or any other amount due and owing to any Secured Party against amounts payable to the Borrower from the Accounts or any part of such Accounts in accordance with and subject to the priorities required by Section 2.07 . 
 (b) The Administrative Agent may take any action permitted under the Basic Documents and may exercise at the Borrower s sole expense any and all rights and remedies of the Borrower under or in connection with the Collateral, including directing that Collections be deposited into an account specified by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) (rather than to the Collection Account). 
 (c) Consistent with the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (and except as otherwise required by the UCC), the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as specified below, foreclose on the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, solicit and accept bids for and sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker s board or at the Administrative Agent s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable and the Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral to any amounts payable by the Borrower with respect to the Obligations in accordance with the priorities required by Section 2.07 . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, at the direction of the Required Lenders following an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(a)(i) or 9.01(a)(ii) , unless: (A) 66 2/3 of the Lenders consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation will be sufficient to pay in full the Loans Outstanding and all accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans Outstanding or (C) the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal and interest on the Loans as they would have become due if the Loans had not been declared immediately due and payable, and the Administrative Agent obtains the consent of the Required Lenders. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above, the Administrative Agent may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as of the sufficiency of the Collateral for such purpose. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by Applicable Law, at least seven Business Days notice to the Borrower (with a copy to each Secured Party) of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Every such sale shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever of the Borrower in and to the Collateral so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against the Borrower or any Person claiming the Collateral sold through the Borrower and its successors or assigns. 
 (d) Upon the completion of any sale under Section 9.02(c) , the Borrower will deliver or cause to be delivered all of the Collateral sold to the purchaser or purchasers at 
 
 LEGAL02/41783784v7 

such sale on the date of sale, or within a reasonable time thereafter if it shall be impractical to make immediate delivery, but in any event full title and right of possession to such property shall pass to such purchaser or purchasers forthwith upon the completion of such sale. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent or by any purchaser, the Borrower shall confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to such purchaser all proper instruments of conveyance and transfer and release as may be designated in any such request. 
 (e) At any sale under Section 9.02(c) , Regional Management or any Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability therefor. Any Secured Party purchasing property at a sale under Section 9.02(c) may set off the purchase price of such property against amounts owing to such Secured Party in full payment of such purchase price up to the full amount owing to such Secured Party. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may direct the Servicer to direct Collections to an account other than the Lockbox (as defined in Schedule G) or the Collection Account. The Administrative Agent and the Servicer agree to cooperate in good faith to provide the Servicer access to the information relating to the Collections deposited into such account in order for the Servicer to perform its related duties hereunder. 
 Section 9.03. Exercise of Remedies . No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower or the Servicer, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Agent or Secured Party, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Parties would otherwise have pursuant to Applicable Law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 
 Section 9.04. Waiver of Certain Laws . The Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and the Borrower, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such Applicable Laws, and any and all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the 
 
 LEGAL02/41783784v7 

Collateral as an entirety or such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine. 
 Section 9.05. Power of Attorney . The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true and lawful attorney (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and deemed occurrence or declaration of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b) , in connection with the enforcement of the rights and remedies provided for in this Article, including (i) to give any necessary receipts or acquittance for amounts collected or received hereunder, (ii) to make all necessary transfers of the Collateral in connection with any sale or other disposition made pursuant hereto, (iii) to execute and deliver for value all necessary or appropriate bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any such sale or other disposition, the Borrower thereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do hereunder and pursuant hereto and (iv) to sign any agreements, orders or other documents in connection with or pursuant to any Basic Document. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, directly or through a purchaser of any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent or such purchaser all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other instruments as may be designated in any such request. On the Closing Date, the Borrower and Regional Management shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1 and Exhibit F-2, respectively.

 (b) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on Additional Amounts) payable or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender or the Administrative Agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided, however, that the Lender or the Administrative Agent making a demand for indemnity payment hereunder shall provide the Borrower with a certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability from the relevant Governmental Authority or from a Responsible Officer of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 (e) If an Agent or Lender is not created or organized under the laws of the United States or a State or is otherwise not a U.S. Person, such Person shall, to the extent that it may then do so under Applicable Law, deliver to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank, on or prior to the date on which such entity becomes an Agent or Lender hereunder and (from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), (i) two executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E, or Form W-8IMY accompanied by the relevant certification documents for each beneficial owner (or any successor forms or other certificates or statements which may be required and requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities or Applicable Law), as appropriate, and (ii) two executed originals of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; provided, however, that the delivery of any form or documentation pursuant to this subclause (other than the specific IRS Forms and related documentation (and any successor forms) described in clause (i) above) shall not be required if in the related Agent s or Lender s reasonable judgment the completion, execution or delivery of such form or documentation would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (f) If a payment made to any Agent or Lender under any Basic Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Agent or Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Agent or Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Account Bank, such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Account Bank as may be necessary for the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Account Bank to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Agent or Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person or to file a refund or claim. 
 (i) The Borrower hereby covenants with the Account Bank that the Borrower will provide the Account with sufficient information as requested by the Account Bank so as to enable the Account Bank to determine whether or not the Account Bank is obliged to make any withholding, including under FATCA, in respect of any payments (and if applicable, to provide the necessary detailed information to effectuate any such withholding) and to provide such additional information as requested by the Account Bank that it may have to assist the Account Bank in making determination as to its obligations with respect to any withholdings or informational reports.

 (a) The Administrative Agent may, without notice to the Borrower except as required by Applicable Law and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and 
 
 LEGAL02/41783784v7 
 LEGAL02/42659596v2 

otherwise apply all or any part of the Loans Outstanding, any Interest accrued thereon and or any other amount due and owing to any Secured Party against amounts payable to the Borrower from the Accounts or any part of such Accounts in accordance with and subject to the priorities required by Section 2.0 7 .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral or any part of the Collateral, at the direction of the Required Lenders following an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(a)(i) or 9.01(a)(ii) , unless: (A) 66 2/3 of the Lenders consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation will be sufficient to pay in full the Loans Outstanding and all accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans Outstanding or (C) the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal and interest on the Loans as they would have become due if the Loans had not been declared immediately due and payable, and the Administrative Agent obtains the consent of the Required Lenders. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) above, the Administrative Agent may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as of the sufficiency of the Collateral for such purpose. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by Applicable Law, at least seven Business Days notice to the Borrower (with a copy to each Secured Party) of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification.

Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent or by any purchaser, the Borrower shall confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to such purchaser all proper instruments of conveyance and transfer and release as may be designated in any such request. 
 (e) At any sale under Section 9.02(c) , Regional Management or any Secured Party may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale and, upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability therefor. Any Secured Party purchasing property at a sale under Section 9.02(c) may set off the purchase price of such property against amounts owing to such Secured Party in full payment of such purchase price up to the full amount owing to such Secured Party. 
 (f) The Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may direct the Servicer to direct Collections to an account other than the Lockbox (as defined in Schedule G) or the Collection Account. The Administrative Agent and the Servicer agree to cooperate in good faith to provide the Servicer access to the information relating to the Collections deposited into such account in order for the Servicer to perform its related duties hereunder. 
 Section 9.03. Exercise of Remedies . No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower or the Servicer, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, any Agent or Secured Party, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Secured Parties would otherwise have pursuant to Applicable Law or equity. No notice to or demand on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or constitute a waiver of the right of the other party to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 
 Section 9.04. Waiver of Certain Laws . The Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force in any locality where any Collateral may be situated in order to prevent, hinder or delay the enforcement or foreclosure of this Agreement, or the absolute sale of any of the Collateral or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereof, and the Borrower, for itself and all who may at any time claim through or under it, hereby waives, to the full extent that it may be lawful so to do, the benefit of all such Applicable Laws, and any and all right to have any of the properties or assets constituting 
 
 LEGAL02/41783784v7 
 LEGAL02/42659596v2 

the Collateral marshaled upon any such sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the security interests granted in this Agreement may sell the Collateral as an entirety or such parcels as the Administrative Agent or such court may determine. 
 Section 9.05. Power of Attorney . The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its true and lawful attorney (with full power of substitution) in its name, place and stead and at its expense, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and deemed occurrence or declaration of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b) , in connection with the enforcement of the rights and remedies provided for in this Article, including (i) to give any necessary receipts or acquittance for amounts collected or received hereunder, (ii) to make all necessary transfers of the Collateral in connection with any sale or other disposition made pursuant hereto, (iii) to execute and deliver for value all necessary or appropriate bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any such sale or other disposition, the Borrower thereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do hereunder and pursuant hereto and (iv) to sign any agreements, orders or other documents in connection with or pursuant to any Basic Document. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, directly or through a purchaser of any of the Collateral, the Borrower shall ratify and confirm any such sale or other disposition by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent or such purchaser all proper bills of sale, assignments, releases and other instruments as may be designated in any such request. On the Closing Date, the Borrower and Regional Management shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a power of attorney in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-1 and Exhibit F-2, respectively.
