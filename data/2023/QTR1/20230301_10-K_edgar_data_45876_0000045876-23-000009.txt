 OUR COMPANY - OUR VISION 
 Harsco Corporation is a market-leading, global provider of environmental solutions for industrial and specialty waste streams. Our two reportable business segments are Harsco Environmental and Harsco Clean Earth and we are a single-thesis environmental solutions company that is a leader in the markets we serve. 
 
 We have worked in recent years to both transform our portfolio and strengthen our financial results, and we have invested to achieve these objectives and to grow the Company. These investments include targeted organic investments, as well as mergers and acquisitions, that have accelerated our business transformation. The purchases of Clean Earth and ESOL, along with the sale of our energy-linked business in 2019 and our plan to sell our Rail business, have been significant strategic steps for our Company. As a result, 100 of our revenues from continuing operations in 2022 and 2021 were generated from our two environmentally-focused segments. It also is important to note that these transactions have reduced the Company s portfolio complexity and business cyclicality. 
 
 More broadly, we are committed to viewing every customer need through a sustainability lens. Our customers are increasingly expecting more customizable solutions that address environmental challenges within their industries. The Company is responding to this need by helping our customers build better businesses and, in a larger sense, a better environment. Our go-forward strategy is clear: to continue building a leading, global environmental solutions company. 
 
 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 The Company s current operations consist of two reportable business segments: Harsco Environmental and Harsco Clean Earth. Until the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reported the Harsco Rail Segment. The Company previously announced its plan to sell the Harsco Rail business and the sale process is ongoing. Historical results for Harsco Rail are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
 
 The Company reports segment information using the management approach, based on the way management organizes and reports the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions, assessing performance and allocating capital. The Company s reporting segments are identified based upon differences in products, services, and markets served. Financial information concerning segments and international and domestic operations is included in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area , in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Our revenues by business segment are as follows, and a further description of the products and services offered through these business segments is presented below. 

1 

HARSCO ENVIRONMENTAL 
 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 Our Harsco Environmental Segment can trace its heritage back to the earliest efforts in industrial recycling and environmental resource management. Where others only saw waste and expense, we saw opportunity and value nearly 100 years ago. HE was founded upon market insights, grounded in respect for the environment, efficient use of resources, and optimism for the future. 
 
 Today, HE is a premier, global provider of environmental services and material processing to the global steel and metals industries. HE partners with its global customer base to deliver production-critical on-site operational support and resource recovery services, through management of our customers primary waste or byproduct streams. Our services support the metal manufacturing process, generating significant operational and financial efficiencies for our customers and allowing them to focus on their core steelmaking businesses. 
 
 HE serves approximately 70 mill services customers at approximately 150 sites in approximately 30 countries. Our diversified customer base includes the largest steel producers in the regions where we operate, serving a mix of mini-mill and integrated operations. In recent years, HE has greatly extended its reach, signing new services contracts in bellwether emerging markets like India, and further strengthening our footprint in the Americas and Europe. As a result, our global portfolio is balanced and diversified, with foreign currency risk partially mitigated by the fact that our operating costs and revenues are regularly denominated in local currencies. 
 
 In addition to providing critical services to our customers, we provide zero-waste solutions for relevant waste or byproduct streams - an important component of our value proposition. We repurpose processed material for alternative uses and / or convert this material into viable products to be sold in other markets via our ecoproducts offerings and capabilities. Our ecoproducts TM portfolio includes road and roofing materials, abrasives, agriculture products and aggregates. This expertise is increasingly important to our customers as environmental regulations increase and the marketplace grows more averse to landfilling waste. 
 
 CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE CONTRACTS 
 We offer our customers a suite of more than 30 services, and our on-site work is performed under long-term contracts. These contracts typically include fixed fees or minimum billings, which de-risk our investment during periods of economic weakness, and variable fees often linked to the amount of metal produced or waste processed at a site. Our variable fees under contracts are, importantly, not linked to steel prices. Additionally, in recent years, we have strengthened our contract terms and underwriting practices in an effort to earn a sufficient and timely return on our investments, as well as achieve other objectives. These measures, along with various improvement initiatives, have boosted our site portfolio results and driven more consistent performance across our operations. 
 
 Our contract renewal rates are high, with many customer relationships that span decades. Our largest customers today include ArcelorMittal, Gerdau, Tata Steel Group, Tisco, and Hebei Iron and Steel Company. We serve most of our major customers at multiple sites, often under multiple contracts. The length of our customer relationships reflects our value proposition. Customers choose the Company to (1) achieve operational and financial efficiencies; (2) concentrate their efforts on metal manufacturing and supporting end-market product demands; (3) gain access to process innovations and technologies developed by the Company; and (4) leverage our downstream product applications and know-how. HE had one customer in each of the past three years that provided more than 10 of this segment's revenues, again under many long-term contracts at multiple sites. 
 
 On December 31, 2022, the Company's service contracts had estimated future revenues of 3.3 billion at current production levels, an increase of 0.2 billion from 2021, excluding foreign currency translation impacts, which is driven by new and renewed contracts. These contract values provide the Company with a substantial base of anticipated long-term revenues. Approximately 20 of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2023; approximately 41 of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2026; approximately 21 of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2027 and December 31, 2029; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. Estimated future revenues are exclusive of anticipated contract renewals, projected volume increases and ad-hoc services, as well as future revenues from roofing granules, abrasives products, roadmaking materials, additives and specialty recovery technology services.

ON-SITE SERVICES 
 HE provides a broad range of services, most of which address our customers environmental challenges. In total, these services reduce both landfill waste and the carbon footprint of our customers sites. In 2022, on-site services represented approximately 85 of HE s revenues. A summary of our most significant services is as follows: 
 
 Resource Recovery, Metal Recycling and Slag Optimization 
 Resource recovery, metal recycling and slag optimization is the core component of our service offerings. We capture liquid steel waste or byproduct (slag) and transport it for cooling, treatment and conditioning. We then recover valuable metal from the waste-stream, which is returned to our customer in a form suitable for recycling through the customers manufacturing process. Finally, the residual non-metallic processed material is transformed into environmental products that create new and additional revenue streams. 
 
 Scrap Management 
 We manage customer scrap inventories and upgrade scrap by making it cleaner and denser. Improved scrap characteristics reduce electricity usage which, combined with the usage of recycled material, provides sustainability benefits to our customers. 
 
 Materials Handling and Logistics 
 We transport materials, including semi-finished and finished products, safely and efficiently for our customers. Our tracking technology also provides real-time analysis of material location, quantities and product quality. 
 
 Meltshop and Furnace Services 
 Meltshop and furnace services allow the molten metal production process to run smoothly and efficiently. These services include under-vessel cleaning and the removal of ladle slag (waste) and general melt shop debris. 
 
 ECOPRODUCTS 
 HE creates value-added downstream products from industrial waste-streams. Our experience in manufacturing these products and successfully penetrating relevant end-markets is an important differentiator for the Company. These zero-waste solutions preserve our natural resources and reduce or eliminate landfill disposal. Ecoproducts in 2022 represented approximately 14 of HE s revenues, and our major ecoproducts include the following: 
 
 Road Surfacing and Materials 
 Because of its natural shape and interlocking properties, steel slag holds many advantages when used in asphalt roadway surfaces, ranging from high skid resistance to better durability. The Company s slag-based asphalt product, developed and sold as SteelPhalt , maintains positive surface characteristics throughout the life of the road, allowing longer replacement intervals and lower maintenance costs. In 2022, SteelPhalt launched a carbon-negative asphalt product, using a renewable bio-based substance to bind the asphalt. This is an alternative to bitumen and reduces the product's carbon footprint. The Company also sells a slag aggregate that is a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to natural stone. This aggregate is often used as unbound road base material for secondary roads and sub-base material elsewhere. 
 
 Abrasives and Roofing Materials 
 Our Reed Minerals business is among the largest roofing granule suppliers in the U.S., partnering with the country's leading shingle manufacturers. Nearly 100 years ago, we pioneered a process of recycling coal combustion waste from power plants. Through the Company's proprietary process, we create premium quality roofing granules that are a critical raw material in asphalt roofing shingles. 
 
 Reed is also one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of abrasives, using coal, as well as copper and nickel slag, and crushed glass, for the surface preparation market. Our BLACK BEAUTY and SURE/CUT abrasives are well-recognized within the industry and are used as blast material to remove paint, rust, and other coatings from surfaces, prior to applying a new finish. 
 
 Metallurgical Additives 
 The Company s custom-designed steelmaking additives facilitate fluid slag formation in the steelmaking process, thus improving customer productivity and helping achieve the steel product specifications required for today s premium applications. 
 
 Agriculture and Turf Products 
 We produce soil conditioners and fertilizers, principally from stainless steel slag that optimize crop yields and turf performance. CrossOver and AgrowSil products are our leading silicon, calcium and magnesium-based product brands, sold mainly in the Americas. These products are formulated to address nutrient deficiencies and toxicity issues in soil as well as to help plants withstand outside pressures and disease. 
 3 

Cement Additives 
 Steel slag is naturally cementitious and commonly blended with other materials to produce environmentally-friendly, high-performing cement products. Cement made with slag aggregate can achieve permeabilities and other attributes that compare favorably to concrete made with conventional aggregates. 
 
 ALTEK GROUP 
 Altek is a UK-based manufacturer of market-leading products that enable aluminum producers and recyclers to manage and extract value from critical waste streams, reduce waste generation, and improve operating productivity. The cost-efficient recovery of metal and other valuable materials is increasingly important to the aluminum industry. Altek s products and technologies address this challenge, and its AluSalt innovation offers customers an innovative technology that converts salt slag waste into valuable products, addressing one of the largest environmental concerns within the aluminum market. 
 
 GROWTH STRATEGY 
 We have identified attractive opportunities that meet our return thresholds to expand our service portfolio, and our pipeline of opportunities remains significant. Additionally, we have initiated efforts to expand our downstream products business and plan to continue investing in innovation to support our business sustainability. 
 
 A summary of our key growth initiatives is as follows: 
 Further Penetrate Existing Sites . Given our broad services capabilities, we see potential for add-on services contracts at existing sites. 
 New Sites. We continue to pursue new services contracts in certain markets, particularly in emerging economies where out-sourcing opportunities are significant because of increased environmental awareness or where steel consumption (production) is set to grow. 
 Investment in Downstream Products . We see opportunities to expand certain products businesses, and our investment in new SteelPhalt (road materials) plants in Europe is a recent example. 
 Innovation . We are at the forefront of innovation in our industry. Our innovation programs are specifically focused on helping our customers solve their most pressing environmental challenges amid ever-increasing regulation. This initiative includes developing new customer or industry solutions, either in-house or externally, and expanding the usage of technologies that already exist within our business. 
 
 COMPETITORS 
 HE competes principally with a small number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers on a global basis. We also compete with numerous smaller, privately-held businesses in each of our regional markets and, to some degree, customers that may decide to perform certain services themselves. 
 
 We believe that HE differentiates itself from its competition through innovative technologies that support our service offerings, and through the operating expertise developed by sharing best practices across our global portfolio. Our safety practices and performance also support our business, as do our long-standing relationships and our downstream product solutions. 
 
 HARSCO CLEAN EARTH 
 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 Our Harsco Clean Earth segment provides specialty waste processing, treatment, recycling, and beneficial reuse solutions for customers in the industrial, retail, healthcare, and construction industries across a variety of waste needs, including hazardous, non-hazardous, and contaminated soils and dredged materials. CE currently operates 18 RCRA Part B permitted TSDFs, wastewater treatment facilities and supporting 10-day transfer facilities across the U.S., serving more than 90,000 customer locations, while utilizing a fleet of over 700 vehicles. It also holds a portfolio of more than 500 critically-important permits, and the waste handled by CE is recycled or beneficially reused. 
 
 Specialty-waste permits have considerable value, and CE is positioned to take advantage of increasingly stringent regulations on the handling of this waste. These dynamics provide recurring revenues and support attractive underlying growth. CE also operates in a fragmented market where acquisition opportunities are likely to develop. As a result, we see CE as a platform for growth as we continue to expand our focus as an environmental solutions company. 
 
 4 

CUSTOMERS 
 CE provides regulatory-compliant solutions with a high quality of customer service to a diverse set of customers. These customers include waste generators in numerous industries, including chemicals, power, aerospace, medical, retail and metals, as well as integrated waste companies and brokers. CE also services federal, state and local governments as well as developers linked to large infrastructure and redevelopment projects. CE had one customer in 2022 and 2021 that provided more than 10 of this segment's revenues. 
 
 LINES OF BUSINESS 
 
 Hazardous Waste 
 CE provides testing, tracking, processing, recycling, and disposal services for hazardous waste and it operates 18 RCRA Part B permitted TSDFs and several wastewater processing permits that enable the Company to process a variety of complex hazardous wastes, consisting of toxic, reactive and flammable materials such as industrial wastewater, manufacturing sludge, oily-mixtures, chemicals, pesticides, asbestos, pharmaceutical waste, and landfill leachate with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"). The remaining facilities handle a limited number of other wastes, including electronics, batteries and light bulbs. These operations possess unique and differentiated processing technologies, such as applications for aerosol can, medical waste recycling, fuel blending, household hazardous waste and lead contaminated soils. In 2022, this line of business represented approximately 82 of CE s revenues. 
 
 Soil and Dredged Materials 
 CE processes approximately 3.2 million tons per year of contaminated soil and 0.4 million cubic yards of dredged material at sixteen locations, which includes fixed-based locations and mobile plants. These soils are contaminated with heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides, PFAS or other chemicals, and the related clean-up work is often the result of infrastructure improvements, private redevelopment, industrial site remediation and/or underground storage tank removal. CE treats and recycles this soil through various processes, after which the material is suitable for beneficial reuse as construction fill material or landfill capping. CE also operates one facility to treat dredged material, the sediment accumulated at the bottom of waterways that is removed for environmental (clean-up) or maintenance (maintain depth) purposes. After treatment, these materials are also beneficially reused as fill material. In 2022, this line of business represented approximately 18 of CE s revenues. 
 
 OPERATIONS AND PERMITS 
 CE provides a suite of regulation-compliant treatment solutions for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that can be tailored to 
 meet customer-specific requirements. The solutions include soil remediation and recycling including thermal desorption, dredged material stabilization and beneficial reuse, hazardous and non-hazardous waste stabilization and solidification, fuel blending, management and recycling, battery and electronic waste recycling, and secure electronic data destruction. 
 
 Additionally, CE holds a portfolio of more than 500 process, treatment and operating permits, including the ones mentioned above. This permit portfolio is difficult to duplicate, making these permits valuable and critically-important assets in this heavily-regulated industry. CE s ability to secure new permits or permit modifications for new waste streams or processes in the future remains an important growth lever for the business. 
 
 GROWTH 
 Favorable underlying market dynamics, driven by increased regulation and a growing list of contaminants and hazardous materials, and investment are anticipated to fuel CE s growth in the coming years. We also anticipate introducing newer technologies into the market with new treatment solutions and expansion of existing technologies, including permit modifications and applications in new geographic markets. Lastly, CE is well-positioned to benefit from a positive outlook for maintenance and environmental dredging, as well as emerging PFAS markets, and over time, we expect acquisitions to be an important growth lever for CE. CE operates in a very fragmented, regionally-driven market, and as a result, we expect to pursue acquisition opportunities that may provide increased scale and/or new capabilities, along with synergies and attractive financial returns to the Company. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 Given the fragmented nature of the specialty waste industry, CE competes with numerous companies. Our larger peers include Clean Harbors, Republic Services, which acquired U.S. Ecology in 2022, Veolia and Heritage Environmental Services within the hazardous materials line of business and GFL Environmental and Impact Environmental within the soil and dredged materials market. CE differentiates itself from competitors through service reliability and responsiveness, its diverse operating capabilities and regulatory compliant solutions, and the value it provides through providing environmentally superior solutions relative to other disposal alternatives in the regions where it operates.

Through these policies and guidelines, we have equipped every employee with the tools, training, and guidance to always do the right things, the right way. Oversight of our ESG practices is provided by the Governance Committee of the Company s Board. 
 
 Further details on our ESG initiatives and accomplishments can be found in our latest ESG Report. This report, published in October 2022, is our most comprehensive sustainability report to date and can be found on the Company s website (www.harsco.com/sustainability) along with other related policies. Unless specifically stated herein, documents and information on the Company's website are not incorporated by reference into this document. 
 
 HARSCO BUSINESS SYSTEM ("HBS") 
 Our HBS is a shared set of processes that reflect and support our corporate strategy. These repeatable and replicable standards and practices are the hallmark of a high-performing company. There is intrinsic value in a common language, and a defined business system does away, in large part, with ambiguity about what constitutes success. The elements of our HBS are: 
 Environmental, Health Safety; Continuous Improvement; Talent Development; Strategic Planning; and Acquisitions Divestitures . 
 
 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
 Given the Company s evolution to a single-thesis environmental solutions company, acquisitions and divestitures have been an important element of our business strategy. These actions support the Company s growth ambitions, while reducing business cyclicality and portfolio complexity. 
 
 The Company is in the process of selling the Rail business with a sale expected to occur in 2023. The intention to sell the business was first announced in the fourth quarter of 2021. The sales process was delayed in 2022 due to certain macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates. Rail is reclassified as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations for all years presented. 
 
 In June 2019, the Company acquired Clean Earth which provided the Company entry into the specialty waste market. In April 2020, the Company acquired ESOL, an established waste transportation, processing and services provider with a comprehensive portfolio of disposal solutions for customers across industrial, retail and healthcare markets. The acquisition of ESOL furthered our transformation into a market-leading, single-thesis environmental solutions platform. Clean Earth and ESOL combined to form Harsco Clean Earth.

SEASONALITY 
 The Company's businesses can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for services and solutions provided by HE are subject to seasonal changes related to weather conditions, inventory management through the steel-industry supply chain, and customer operating outages. The timing of these impacts varies by region, however, overall customer demand for HE across its global footprint tend to be strongest in the second quarter and third quarter of each year. CE, meanwhile, provides services that can also fluctuate seasonally with weather, construction activity, industrial production, retail spending and municipal waste collection programs. As a result, demand for CE services tends to be weakest in the first and fourth quarters of each year. 
 
 Due to these factors, the Company s revenues and earnings are usually higher during the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth quarter of the year. Additionally, the Company s cash flows are also influenced by seasonality. The Company s cash flow from operations has historically been higher in the second half of the year, compared with the first half, due to working capital management, receivable collections during the fourth quarter as a result of higher revenues in preceding quarters and the timing of certain cash payments in the first half of the year, including for incentive compensation and pension contributions. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 
 The Company is subject to various environmental regulations within its global operations, and the scope of relevant environmental regulation expanded following the Company s acquisition of Clean Earth and ESOL in 2019 and 2020, respectively. CE operates within an industry that is subject to stringent environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities, which regulate the treatment and disposal of specialty waste. Facility and operating permits, or approvals from these authorities, are required to maintain operations. The nature of these permits varies by jurisdiction and are based on the activities at a particular site. These permits are generally difficult to obtain. This dynamic, along with increased regulation on the treatment and disposal of specialty waste, is beneficial to our CE business. 
 
 The most significant U.S. federal environmental regulation that impacts our business is the RCRA. RCRA created a cradle-to-grave system which governs the transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. Under RCRA, each hazardous waste processing facility must maintain a RCRA permit and comply with defined operating practices. This legislation is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), although its authority may be delegated to a State EPA with similar or more stringent environmental standards. 
 
 The Company is also subject to air and water quality control legislation in the U.S. and in foreign countries where the Company operates. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into waterways and sewers in the U.S, and, where necessary, we obtain and must comply with permits to discharge wastewater from our facilities. Similarly, the Clean Air Act in the U.S. controls emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits for certain emissions. 
 
 The Company regards compliance with all applicable environmental regulations as critical to its business. Historically, the Company has been able to renew and retain all required permits to maintain its operations, and it has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with relevant environmental regulations. The Company also does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures to comply with, or improve, environmental performance in the future. While environmental regulations may increase or expand, we cannot predict the extent of this future environmental regulation, its related costs and the overall effect on the Company s business. 
 
 For additional information regarding environmental matters see Note 12, Commitment and Contingencies , in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The following discussion of risks contains forward-looking statements, and the risks set forth below are not the only risks faced by the Company. The Company's business operations could also be affected by other factors not presently known to the Company or factors that the Company currently does not consider to be material. 
 
 STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 
 We may be unable to complete a transaction to divest our Rail division on favorable terms or at all and our pursuit of a divestiture could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We previously announced that we intend to divest our Rail division. Our announcement, and our conducting, of a divestiture process for our Rail division involves various risks and uncertainties, including changes in economic conditions, the risk that we may be unsuccessful in identifying an acquirer for the division, unable to enter into an agreement for a transaction and any agreement that we may enter into may not be on favorable terms and/or may not be completed due to regulatory or other factors. Moreover, the announcement and conduct of the divestiture process could cause disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our Rail division, including affecting the Rail division s relationships with its existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on the Rail division s operations and financial condition, potentially making it more difficult to successfully complete a transaction on favorable terms. If we are unable to complete a divestiture of our Rail division or we complete a transaction on unfavorable terms, we may suffer negative publicity, our Rail and other businesses may suffer, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected and the market value of our shares may fall. In addition, the divestiture process may require commitments of significant time and resources on the part of management. As a result, the divestiture process may divert management s attention from overseeing and exploring opportunities that may be beneficial to our other businesses and operations and, as such, adversely affect our other businesses and operations and harm our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and the market value of our shares. 
 
 If the Harsco Clean Earth Segment fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, its business could be adversely affected. 
 The regulatory framework governing the Harsco Clean Earth Segment's business is extensive. The Company could be held liable if its operations cause contamination of air, groundwater or soil or expose its employees or the public to contamination. The Company may be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before it acquired the assets, business or operations involved. Also, it may be liable if it generates, transports or arranges for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination at facilities operated by others, or if a predecessor generated, transported, or made such arrangements and the Company is a successor. Liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company may also be held liable for the mishandling of waste streams resulting from the misrepresentations by a customer as to the nature of such waste streams. 
 
 Stringent regulations of federal, state and local governments have a substantial impact on the Harsco Clean Earth Segment s transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and beneficial use activities. Many complex laws, rules, orders and regulatory interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, noise, visual impact, odor, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. The Company also may be subject to laws concerning the protection of certain marine and bird species, their habitats, and wetlands. It may incur substantial costs in order to conduct its operations in compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Changes in environmental laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws, regulations or permitted activities may require the Company to make significant capital or other expenditures, to modify existing operating licenses or permits, or obtain additional approvals or limit operations. New environmental laws or regulations that raise compliance standards or require changes in operating practices or technology may impose significant costs and/or limit the Company s operations. 
 
 The Harsco Clean Earth Segment s revenue is primarily generated as a result of requirements imposed on its customers under federal, state and local laws and regulations to protect public health and the environment. If requirements to comply with laws and regulations governing management of contaminated soils, dredge material, and hazardous wastes were relaxed or less vigorously enforced at the federal, state and local levels, demand for the Harsco Clean Earth Segment s services could materially decrease and the Company's revenues and earnings could be reduced. 
 
 10 

If the Harsco Clean Earth Segment is unable to obtain, renew, or maintain compliance with its operating permits or license agreements with regulatory bodies, its business would be adversely affected. 
 The Harsco Clean Earth Segment's facilities operate using permits and licenses issued by various regulatory bodies at various local, state and federal government levels. Failure to obtain permits and licenses necessary to operate these facilities on a timely basis or failure to renew or maintain compliance with its permits, licenses and site lease agreements on a timely basis could prevent or restrict the Company's ability to provide certain services, resulting in a material adverse effect on its business. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in obtaining timely permit or license applications approval, maintaining compliance with its permits, licenses and lease agreements and obtaining timely license renewals. 
 
 The waste management industry, in which the Harsco Clean Earth Segment is a participant, is subject to various economic, business, and regulatory risks. 
 The future operating results of the Harsco Clean Earth Segment may be affected by such factors as its ability to utilize its facilities and workforce profitably in the face of intense price competition, maintain or increase market share during periods of economic contraction or industry consolidation, realize benefits from cost reduction programs, invest in new technologies for treatment of various waste streams, generate incremental volumes of waste to be handled through the Harsco Clean Earth Segment s facilities from existing and acquired sales offices and service centers, appropriately contract with end disposal sites for the necessary volumes of waste, obtain sufficient volumes of waste at prices which produce revenue sufficient to offset the operating costs of its facilities and minimize downtime and disruptions of operations. 
 
 Outdoor construction, which may be limited due to unfavorable weather, and dredging, which may be limited due to environmental restrictions in certain waterways in the Northeastern United States, can be cyclical in nature. If those cyclical industries slow significantly, the business that the Harsco Clean Earth Segment receives from them would likely decrease. 
 
 The seasonality of the Company's business may cause quarterly results to fluctuate. 
 The majority of the Company's cash flows provided by operations has historically been generated in the second half of the year. This is a result of normally higher income during the second and third quarters of the year, as the Company's business tends to follow seasonal patterns. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the cash flow and other effects of seasonality on the business, its results of operations may suffer. 
 
 Customer concentration and related credit and commercial risks, together with the long-term nature of contracts, may adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s top five customers in the Harsco Environmental Segment accounted for approximately 31 of revenues in that Segment and 17 of the Company s consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s top five customers in the Clean Earth Segment accounted for approximately 29 of the revenues in that Segment and 13 of the Company s consolidated revenues. The Company routinely enters into contracts with its top customers of varying length and scope. Disagreements between the parties can arise as a result of the scope, nature and varying degree of relationship between the Company and these customers and can result in disagreements between the Company and a customer that could impact multiple regions within the Company s business. 
 
 The Clean Earth Segment may enter into a long-term contract with a customer covering multiple regions in the United States. A dispute with a customer in one region in the United States could impact the Company s revenues related to that customer in another region. The Harsco Environmental Segment may incur capital expenditures or other costs at the beginning of a long-term contract that it expects to recoup through the life of the contract. Some of these contracts provide for advance payments to assist the Company in covering these costs and expenses. A dispute with a customer during the life of a long-term contract could impact the ability of the Company to receive payments or otherwise recoup incurred costs and expenses. 
 
 Finally, both the Harsco Environmental Segment and the Harsco Clean Earth Segment have several large customers and, if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy or receivership protection, it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations. 
 
 The Company may lose customers or be required to maintain or reduce prices as a result of competition. 
 The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. Some examples are as follows: 
 The Harsco Environmental Segment is sustained mainly through contract renewals and new contract signings. The Company may be unable to renew contracts at historical price levels or to obtain additional contracts at historical rates as a result of competition. If the Company is unable to renew its contracts at the historical rates or renewals are made at reduced prices, or if its customers terminate their contracts, revenue and results of operations may decline. 
 11 

Like the Harsco Environmental Segment, the Harsco Clean Earth Segment is sustained primarily through contract renewals and new contract signings. The Harsco Clean Earth Segment faces competition from companies with greater resources than the Company, with closer geographic proximity to waste sites, with captive end disposal assets, and who may provide service offerings that we do not provide. In order to compete, the Company may be required to reduce price levels below historical price levels or obtain additional contracts at rates lower than historical rates. 
 The Rail business competes with companies that manufacture similar products both internationally and domestically. Certain international competitors export their products into the U.S. and sell them at lower prices, which can be the result of lower labor costs and government subsidies for exports. In addition, certain competitors may from time to time sell their products below their cost of production in an attempt to increase their market share. Such practices may limit the prices the Rail business can charge for its products and services. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates can also adversely impact the Rail business s ability to match the prices charged by international competitors. If the Rail business is unable to match the prices charged by competitors, it may lose customers. 
 
 Higher than expected claims under insurance policies, under which the Company retains a portion of the risk, could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company retains a significant portion of the risk for property, workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile and general and product liability losses. Reserves have been recorded that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. If actual claims are higher than those projected by management, an increase to the Company's insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded as a charge to income in the period the need for the change was determined. 
 
 The Harsco Clean Earth Segment's insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs, or liabilities that it may experience. 
 The Harsco Clean Earth Segment maintains insurance coverage, but these policies do not cover all of its potential losses, costs, or liabilities. The Company could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of its existing insurance coverage, which would significantly affect its financial performance. For example, the Company's pollution legal liability insurance excludes costs related to fines, penalties, or assessments. The Company's insurance policies also have deductibles and self-retention limits that could expose it to significant financial expense. The Company s ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the Harsco Clean Earth Segment s business requires that it maintain various types of insurance. If such insurance is not available or not available on economically acceptable terms, the Clean Earth Segment s and our businesses could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Increases in purchase prices (or decreases in selling prices) or availability of steel or other materials and commodities may affect the Company's profitability. 
 The profitability of the Company's products and services may be affected by changing purchase prices of raw material, including steel and other materials and commodities, supplier costs or own labor costs. If raw material costs, supplier or labor costs increase and the costs cannot be transferred to the Company's customers, results of operations would be adversely affected. Additionally, decreased availability of steel or other materials or services could affect the Company's ability to provide products and services in a timely manner. If the Company cannot obtain the necessary raw materials, then revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 Certain services performed by the Harsco Environmental Segment result in the recovery, processing and sale of recovered metals and minerals and other high-value metal byproducts to its customers. The selling price of the byproducts material is market-based and varies based upon the current fair value of its components. Therefore, the revenue amounts generated from the sale of such byproducts material vary based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold. 
 
 The success of the Company's strategic ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations. 
 The Company enters into various strategic ventures as part of its strategic growth initiatives as well as to comply with local laws. Differences in opinions or views between strategic venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues which could adversely affect the business and operations of the venture. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, the Company may accept risks or responsibilities for the strategic venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward it expects to receive. The success of these and other strategic ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by the Company's strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the strategic venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. 
 12 

If the Company's strategic venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their strategic venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, the strategic venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, the Company may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for the Company with respect to the strategic venture. In addition, although the Company generally performs due diligence with regard to potential strategic partners or ventures, a failure by a strategic venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact its business and, in the case of government contracts, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment. Unexpected strategic venture developments could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 If the Company fails to maintain safe worksites, it may be subject to significant operating risks and hazards. 
 The Company operates at facilities that may be inherently dangerous workplaces. The Harsco Clean Earth Segment operates facilities that accept, process and/or treat materials provided by its customers. The Harsco Environmental Segment has operations at customers' steel producing sites, which often times involve extreme conditions. If serious accidents or fatalities occur or its safety record was to deteriorate, it may be ineligible to bid on certain work, and existing service arrangements could be terminated. Further, regulatory changes implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or similar foreign agencies, could impose additional costs on the Company. Adverse experience with hazards and claims could result in liabilities caused by, among other things, injury or death to persons, which could have a negative effect on the Company s reputation with its existing or potential new customers and its prospects for future business. 
 
 The Company maintains a workforce based upon current and anticipated workload. If the Company does not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed, significant cost may result that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. 
 The Company's estimates of future performance depend on, among other matters, whether and when the Company will receive certain new contract awards, including the extent to which the Company utilizes its workforce. The rate at which the Company utilizes its workforce is impacted by a variety of factors, including: 
 the ability to manage attrition; 
 the ability to forecast the need for services, which allows the Company to maintain an appropriately sized workforce; 
 the ability to transition employees from completed projects to new projects or between segments; and 
 the need to devote resources to non-revenue generating activities such as training or business development. 
 
 While the Company's estimates are based upon good faith judgment, these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information. In the case of large-scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when the Company will receive a contract award. The uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching the Company's workforce size with contract needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, the Company could incur cost resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities or equipment that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. 
 
 Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results. 
 A significant portion of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with the Company's employees will be resolved or that the Company will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or the Company's employees. The Company may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and other countries when they expire. If the Company fails to renegotiate existing collective bargaining agreements, the Company could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company's facilities in the future. The Company may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to the Company's business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at the Company's facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, many of the Company's customers and suppliers have unionized work forces, and may experience a lack of qualified employees. Strikes or work stoppages, as well as labor shortages, experienced by the Company's customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and supply chain, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 13 

The Company's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or duplicative products and services. 
 The Company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar or duplicative products and services, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by the Company to protect the Company's intellectual property will be sufficient or that the Company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the Company's technology. The Company could also face competition in some countries where the Company has not protected its intellectual property portfolio. The Company may also face attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company's information technology systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of the Company's trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect the Company's competitive position and the value of the Company's investment in research and development. The Company may be unable to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings. In addition, the Company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages or could be enjoined from offering some of the Company's products and services. Also, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses needed in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms. 
 
 Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to the Company's and its vendors, systems, networks, products and services . 
 The Company relies upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties (which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties ). Additionally, the Company and its associated third parties collect and store data that is of a sensitive nature, which may include names and addresses, bank account information, and other types of personal information or sensitive business information. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to the Company's business operations and strategy. 
 
 Threats to our systems and our associated third parties' systems can derive from human error, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Globally these types of threats have increased in number and severity and it is expected that these trends will continue. These threats pose a risk to the security of the Company's systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company's data. Should an attack on the Company's or our associated third parties information technology systems and networks succeed, it could expose the Company and the Company's employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions. In 2021, an associated third party was the target of a cybersecurity attack. The attack did not result in the theft of personally identifiable information of any employees, but it resulted in logistical challenges with respect to internal reporting systems. 
 
 The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and cash flows. While we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering certain expenses, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered, or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. 
 
 In addition, various privacy and security laws govern the protection of this information and breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures. For example, the European Union's ("EU") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") extends the scope of the EU data protection laws to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the company s location. The potential compliance costs with or imposed by new or existing regulations and policies that are applicable to us could have a material impact on our results of operations.

MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS 
 
 Negative economic conditions may adversely impact demand for the Company's products and services, as well as the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis. 
 Negative economic conditions, including the tightening of credit in financial markets, can lead businesses to postpone spending, which may impact the Company's customers, causing them to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with the Company. In addition, economic conditions may impact the Company's customers by either causing them to close locations serviced by the Harsco Environmental Segment or causing their financial condition to deteriorate to a point where they are unable to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis. One or more of these events could adversely impact the Company's operating results and ability to collect its receivables. 
 
 Cyclical industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the Company's businesses. 
 The Company's businesses are subject to general economic slowdowns and cyclical conditions in each of the industries served. Examples are: 
 
 The Harsco Environmental Segment may be adversely impacted by prolonged slowdowns in steel mill production, excess production capacity, bankruptcy or receivership of steel producers and changes in outsourcing practices; 
 The resource recovery and slag optimization technologies business of the Harsco Environmental Segment can also be adversely impacted by prolonged slowdowns in customer production or a reduction in the selling prices of its materials, which are in some cases market-based and vary based upon the current fair value of the components being sold. Therefore, the revenue generated from the sale of such recycled materials varies based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold; 
 The abrasives and roofing materials business of the Harsco Environmental Segment may be adversely impacted by economic conditions that slow the rate of residential roof replacement, or by slowdowns in the industrial and infrastructure refurbishment industries; 
 Prolonged slowdowns may result in a decrease in the amount of waste generated, resulting in less hazardous waste collected by the Clean Earth Segment; and 
 Capital constraints and increased borrowing costs may also adversely impact the financial position and operations of the Company's customers across all business segments. 
 
 Furthermore, utilization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent on generating sufficient income in future periods to ensure recovery of those assets. The cyclicality of the Company's end markets and adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the future income levels that are necessary for the utilization of deferred tax assets. 
 
 Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the Company's business. 
 Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the approximately 25 other currencies in which the Company currently conducts business may adversely impact the Company's results of operations in any given fiscal period. The Company s principal foreign currency exposures are in the EU, the U.K., China and Brazil. Given the structure of the Company's operations, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which the Company earns its revenues generally has a negative impact on the translated amounts of the assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's foreign currency exposures increase the risk of volatility in its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If currencies in the below regions change materially in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially affected. 
 
 Compared with the corresponding full-year period in 2021, the average value of major currencies changed as follows in relation to the U.S. dollar during the full-year 2022, impacting the Company's revenues and income: 
 
 British pound sterling weakened by 11 ; 
 Euro weakened by 11 ; 
 Chinese yuan weakened by 5 ; and 
 Brazilian real strengthened by 5 
 
 Compared with exchange rates at December 31, 2021, the value of major currencies at December 31, 2022 changed as follows: 
 
 British pound sterling weakened by 11 ; 
 Euro weakened by 6 ; 
 Chinese yuan weakened by 8 ; and 
 Brazilian real strengthened by 5 
 
 15 

To illustrate the effect of foreign exchange rate changes in certain key markets of the Company, in 2022 revenues would have been approximately 4 or 70 million higher and operating income would have been 9 or 5 million higher if the average exchange rates for 2021 were utilized. In a similar comparison for 2021, revenues would have been 1 or approximately 21 million lower and operating income would have been less than 1 or less than 1 million higher if the average exchange rates for 2020 were utilized. 
 
 Currency changes also result in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into U.S. dollars at different amounts than at the prior period end. Generally, if the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets, liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would increase. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets, liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would decrease. 
 
 Although the Company engages in foreign currency exchange forward contracts and other hedging strategies to mitigate foreign exchange transactional risks, hedging strategies may not be successful or may fail to completely offset these risks. In addition, competitive conditions in the Company's manufacturing businesses may limit the Company's ability to increase product prices in the face of adverse currency movement. Sales of products manufactured in the U.S. for the domestic and export markets may be affected by the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. Any long-term strengthening of the U.S. dollar could depress demand for these products and reduce sales. Conversely, any long-term weakening of the U.S. dollar could improve demand for these products and increase sales. 
 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
 
 The Company's global presence subjects it to a variety of risks arising from doing business internationally. 
 The Company operates in approximately 30 countries, generating 43 of its revenues outside of the U.S. (based on location of the facility generating the revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 57 of the Company s property, plant and equipment is located outside of the U.S. The Company's global footprint exposes it to a variety of risks that may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. These include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
 periodic economic downturns in the countries in which the Company does business; 
 complexities around changes in the still developing relationship between the U.K. and the EU arising out of the U.K. s withdrawal from the EU; 
 imposition of or increases in currency exchange controls and hard currency shortages; 
 customs matters and changes in trade policy or tariff regulations; 
 changes in regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company does business; 
 changes in tax regulations, higher tax rates in certain jurisdictions and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings, adverse tax withholding requirements and "double taxation"; 
 longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; 
 complexities in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign government laws, controls and regulations; 
 political, economic and social instability, civil and political unrest, terrorist actions and armed hostilities in the regions or countries in which, or adjacent to which, the Company does business; 
 increasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including the EU's GDPR; 
 inflation rates in the countries in which the Company does business; 
 complying with complex labor laws in foreign jurisdictions; 
 laws in various international jurisdictions that limit the right and ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met; 
 sovereign risk related to international governments, including, but not limited to, governments stopping interest payments or repudiating their debt, nationalizing private businesses or altering foreign exchange regulations; 
 uncertainties arising from local business practices, cultural considerations and international political and trade tensions; and 
 public health issues or other calamities impacting regions or countries in which the Company operates, including travel to and/or imports or exports to or from such regions or countries. 
 
 If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with its global business, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be negatively impacted. 
 
 16 

Due to the international nature of the Company's business, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of certain laws. 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of off the books slush funds from which improper payments can be made. The Company may be unsuccessful in its efforts to prevent reckless or criminal acts by employees or agents and may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees or agents of businesses or operations the Company may acquire. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company s operations, require significant management involvement and have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If the Company is found to be liable for violations of these laws (either due to its own acts, out of inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), the Company could also be subject to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions; disgorgement; further changes or enhancements to its procedures, policies and controls; personnel changes and other remedial actions. 
 
 Furthermore, the Company is subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the U.S., including the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control within the Department of Treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit the Company s ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer its 
 products to prohibited countries or persons. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. Government contracts. 
 
 A negative outcome on personal injury claims against the Company may adversely impact results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Company has been named as one of many defendants (approximately 90 or more in most cases) in legal actions alleging personal injury from exposure to airborne asbestos over the past several decades. In their suits, the plaintiffs have named as defendants, among others, many manufacturers, distributors and installers of numerous types of equipment or products that allegedly contained asbestos. The majority of the asbestos complaints pending against the Company have been filed in New York. Almost all of the New York complaints contain a standard claim for damages of 20 million or 25 million against the approximately 90 defendants, regardless of the individual plaintiff's alleged medical condition and without specifically identifying any of the Company s products as the source of plaintiff's asbestos exposure. If the Company is found to be liable in any of these actions and the liability exceeds the Company's insurance coverage, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 The Company s ongoing operations are subject to extensive laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters that impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company, and future laws and governmental standards could increase these costs and liabilities. 
 The Company is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, rules and ordinances regulating the use of certain materials contained in its products and/or used in its manufacturing processes. Many of these laws and governmental standards provide for extensive obligations that require the Company to incur significant compliance costs and impose substantial monetary fines and/or criminal sanctions for violations. 
 
 Furthermore, such laws and standards are subject to change and may become more stringent. Although it is not possible to predict changes in laws or other governmental standards, the development, proposal or adoption of more stringent laws or governmental standards may require the Company to change its processes, for example, by reducing or eliminating use of the regulated component or material in its process. The Company may not be able to develop a new process to comply with such legal and regulatory changes without investing significant time and resources, if at all. In addition, such legal and regulatory changes may also affect buying decisions by the users of the Company s products that contain regulated materials or that involve the use of such materials in the process. If applicable laws and governmental standards become more stringent, the Company s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 17 

The Company is subject to various environmental laws, and the success of existing or future environmental claims against it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition to the environmental and safety considerations discussed above with respect to the Harsco Clean Earth Segment, the Company's operations generally are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of health, safety and the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous byproducts, the remediation of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for remediation or other costs or damages under these laws. The Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future, and compliance with more stringent environmental requirements may require the Company to make material expenditures or subject it to liabilities that the Company currently does not anticipate. 
 
 The Company is currently involved in a number of environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and, along with other companies, has been identified as a "potentially responsible party" for certain byproduct disposal sites under the federal "Superfund" law. At several sites, the Company is currently conducting environmental remediation, and it is probable that the Company will agree to make payments toward funding certain other of these remediation activities. It also is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably to the Company and that other sites requiring remediation will be identified. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and financial exposure is dependent upon the following factors: 
 the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements; 
 the availability and application of technology; 
 the allocation of cost among potentially responsible parties; 
 the years of remedial activity required; and 
 the remediation methods selected. 
 
 The nature of the Company s products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims, which could harm its business. 
 The Company s customers use some of its products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. In addition, the Company s products are integral to the production process for some end-users and any failure of the Company s products could result in a suspension of operations, including products historically sold by business units of the Company to the extent that the Company retains liability for such historical products. Accidents may occur at a location where the Company s equipment and services have been or are being used. Investigations into such accidents, even if the Company and its products are ultimately found not to be the cause of such accidents, require the Company to expend significant time, effort and resources. The Company cannot be certain that its products will be completely free from defects. The Company may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. The Company also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels it believes are necessary and at rates it considers reasonable. 
 
 FINANCIAL, TAX AND FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS 
 
 Restrictions imposed by the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, accounts receivable securitization facility and other financing arrangements may limit the Company's operating and financial flexibility. 
 The agreements governing the Company's outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions. Under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. The covenants also place limitations on dividends, acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness and the imposition of liens on the Company's assets. In the event of a default, the Company's lenders and the counterparties to the Company's other financing arrangements could terminate their commitments to the Company and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interests and fees, immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company might not be able to pay these amounts, or the Company might be forced to seek an amendment to the Company's financing arrangements which could make the terms of these arrangements more onerous for the Company. In addition, this could also trigger an event of default under the cross-default provisions of the Company's other obligations. As a result, a default under one or more of the existing or future financing arrangements could have significant consequences for the Company. 
 
 18 

The Company is exposed to counterparty risk in its derivative financial arrangements. 
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts, for a variety of purposes. The Company uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with certain debt issuances in order to secure either a fixed or floating interest rate. The Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts as part of a worldwide program to minimize foreign currency operating income and balance sheet exposure. In particular, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge commitments, such as foreign currency debt, firm purchase commitments and foreign currency cash flows for certain export sales transactions. The unsecured contracts for foreign 
 currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 mature at various times through 2023 and are with major financial institutions. The Company may also enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity exposures. The failure of one or more counterparties to the Company's derivative financial instruments to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. 
 
 The Company s variable rate indebtedness subjects it to interest rate risk, which could cause the Company's debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
 The Company's total debt at December 31, 2022 was 1.4 billion. Of this amount, approximately 63 had variable rates of interest and approximately 37 had fixed interest rates. The weighted average interest rate of total debt was approximately 6.5 . At debt levels as of December 31, 2022, a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would increase interest expense by 8.7 million per year and a one percentage point decrease in variable interest rates would decrease interest expense by 8.7 million. If the Company is unable to successfully manage its exposure to variable interest rates, including through interest rate swaps that the Company has put into place, its debt service obligations may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same and, in turn, its results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. Separately, a one percentage point change in interest rates also impacts our facility fees from our AR Facility by 1.4 million per year. 
 
 The Company is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions and could be subject to additional tax liabilities, which could materially adversely affect the Company s results of operations and cash flows and impact the Company s ability to compete abroad. 
 The Company is subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, value-added, fuel and other types of taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 
 The Company's tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors, such as changes in business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which the related tax benefits may not be realized, and changes in deferred tax assets and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating the Company's tax expense and liabilities. The ultimate tax determination for many transactions and calculations is uncertain. For example, the Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not historically required, significant judgments to be made in interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or administered. As future guidance is issued, the Company may need to make adjustments to amounts previously recorded, and those adjustments could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made. 
 
 The Company's defined benefit NPPC is directly affected by equity and bond markets. A downward trend in those markets could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 In addition to the economic issues that directly affect the Company's businesses, changes in the performance of equity and bond markets, particularly in the U.K. and the U.S., impact actuarial assumptions used in determining annual NPPC, pension liabilities and the valuation of the assets in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Financial market deterioration would most likely have a negative impact on the Company's NPPC and the pension assets and liabilities. This could result in a decrease to stockholders' equity and an increase in the Company's statutory funding requirements.

Executive Overview 
 The Company is a market-leading, global provider of environmental solutions for industrial, retail and medical waste streams. The Company's operations consist of two reportable segments: Harsco Environmental and Harsco Clean Earth. The Company is a single-thesis environmental solutions company that is a leader in the markets that we serve. The Harsco Environmental Segment operates primarily under long-term contracts, providing critical environmental services and material processing to the global steel and metals industries, including zero-waste solutions for manufacturing byproducts within the metals industry. The Harsco Clean Earth Segment provides specialty waste processing, treatment, recycling, and beneficial reuse solutions for customers in the industrial, retail, healthcare, and construction industries across a variety of waste needs, including hazardous, non-hazardous, and contaminated soils and dredged materials. The Company has locations in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. The Company was incorporated in 1956. 
 
 The Company is in the process of selling the Rail business with a sale expected to occur in 2023. The intention to sell the business was first announced in the fourth quarter of 2021. The sales process was delayed in 2022 due to certain macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the former Harsco Rail Segment are classified as Assets held-for-sale and Liabilities of assets held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the operating results of the former Harsco Rail Segment are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 
 The Company maintains a positive outlook across its businesses supported by favorable underlying growth characteristics in its businesses and investments by the Company to further supplement growth. The Company's view beyond 2022 is supported by the below factors, which should be considered in the context of other risks, trends and strategies, as referenced in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors : 
 
 HE: 2023 results are expected to be modestly above 2022 results as positive impacts from higher service pricing, net of inflation, cost and operational improvement initiatives and higher environmental services and products demand at certain sites, including those linked to growth investments, are expected to be offset by the impacts of foreign exchange translation and a less favorable service mix. The global steel market has experienced a period of volatility in recent quarters due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting energy crisis in Europe, as well as inventory management through the steel industry supply-chain and a change to the economic conditions due to rising interest rates. Underlying business conditions are expected to stabilize in early 2023 and these external factors are not anticipated to have a material impact on performance in 2023. Over the longer-term, the Company expects HE to grow as a result of economic growth that supports higher global steel consumption, as well as investments and innovation that support the environmental solutions needs of customers. 
 
 CE: 2023 results are anticipated to improve meaningfully compared to 2022, as a result of higher services pricing, net of inflation, cost and operational improvements and a modest increase in environmental services demand across certain end-markets. These benefits include pricing and operating cost initiatives implemented during the second half of 2022, along with additional improvements to be initiated in 2023. Longer-term, the Company expects this segment to benefit from positive underlying market trends, supported by increased environmental regulation, further growth opportunities and its attractive asset position, as well as from the less cyclical and recurring nature of this business.

Comparative Analysis of Consolidated Results 
 Revenues 
 Revenues for 2022 increased 40.7 million, or 2 , from 2021. Revenues for 2021 increased 314.4 million, or 20 , from 2020. These increases were attributable to the following significant items: 
 Changes in Revenues (In millions) 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Impact of ESOL acquisition 134.2 Net effect of price/volume changes in HE, primarily attributable to volume changes 74.7 138.3 Net effect of price/volume changes in CE, primarily attributable to pricing changes 47.5 Net effect of price/volume changes in CE, primarily attributable to volume changes 25.6 Net impact of new contracts and lost contracts (including exited underperforming contracts) in HE (10.4) (5.6) Foreign currency translation (70.2) 20.8 Other (1.0) 1.1 Total change in revenues 40.7 314.4 
 Cost of Sales 
 Cost of sales for 2022 increased 62.7 million or 4 from 2021. Cost of sales for 2021 increased 248.3 million or 20 from 2020. These increases were attributable to the following significant items: 
 Change in Cost of Sales (In millions) 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Change in costs due to changes in revenues volume 50.3 116.2 Changes in costs due to change in prices, including materials, labor, fuel, transportation and maintenance 68.4 2.9 Foreign currency translation (60.3) 19.2 Other 4.3 6.0 Impact of ESOL acquisition 104.0 Total change in cost of sales 62.7 248.3 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses for 2022 decreased 4.2 million or 2 from 2021, which is primarily driven by a 5.5 million reduction in professional fees during the year ended December 31, 2022, principally in the CE and Corporate Segments; partially offset by higher rent expense of 1.7 million across all segments. 
 
 SG A expenses for 2021 decreased 12.2 million, or 4 , from 2020. The decrease is primarily due to acquisition and integration costs totaling 49.0 million that were incurred in 2020 related to the acquisition of ESOL that did not repeat in 2021, partially offset by the incremental impact of SG A expenses associated with the ESOL business of 22.9 million and higher compensation costs in 2021 of 9.3 million, principally in the CE and Corporate Segments. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges 
 The Company recorded impairment charges of 119.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes a 104.6 million charge related to goodwill in CE and a 15.0 million charge related to the intangible assets in HE. There were no such charges incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Other (Income) Expenses, Net 
 The major components of this Consolidated Statements of Operations caption are detailed below. See Note 18, Other (Income) Expenses, Net , in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 Other (Income) Expenses (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Employee termination benefits costs 6,490 4,766 10,249 Net gains (4,013) (8,902) (3,723) Contingent consideration adjustments (827) 2,386 Impaired asset write-downs 641 1,005 776 Other costs to exit activities 1,446 663 533 Other (income) expense 1,000 (1,254) (149) Total other (income) expenses, net 4,737 (3,722) 10,072 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense in 2022 was 75.2 million, an increase of 11.9 million, or 19 , compared with 2021. This increase primarily relates to higher weighted average interest rates, in addition to higher outstanding borrowings during 2022, related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 Interest expense in 2021 was 63.2 million, an increase of 5.0 million, or 9 , compared with 2020. This increase primarily relates to higher outstanding borrowings. 
 See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 
 Facility Fees and Debt-Related Income (Expense) 
 During 2022, the Company recognized 3.0 million of net expense, which included fees related to the amending of the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities and fees related to the Company's Account Receivables Securitization Facility. A 2.3 million gain on the repurchase of 25.0 million of Senior Notes recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 partially offset these fees. 
 
 During 2021 , the Company recognized 5.5 million of fees and other costs primarily related to the amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 
 During 2020, the Company recognized 1.9 million of fees and expenses related to the amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 
 See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 Defined Benefit Pension Income (Expense) 
 Defined benefit pension income in 2022 was 8.9 million, compared to defined benefit pension income of 15.6 million in 2021 . This decrease is primarily the result of a lower assumed rate of return on plan assets in 2022. 
 
 Defined benefit pension income in 2021 was 15.6 million compared to defined benefit pension expense of 7.1 million in 2020 . This change is primarily the result of higher plan asset values at December 31, 2021 . 
 
 See Note 1 0. Employee Ben efit Plans in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) from Continuing Operations 
 Income tax expense from continuing operations in 2022 was 10.4 million, compared with 9.1 million income tax expense from continuing operations in 2021. The effective income tax rate relating to continuing operations for 2022 was (8.4) , versus 24.2 for 2021. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to increased disallowed interest expense in 2022 as a result of lower taxable income in U.S. and a 6.8 million Brazil tax benefit recorded in 2021 resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets not recurring in 2022, partially offset by a 3.0 million tax benefit recorded on a 104.6 million goodwill impairment recorded for the Harsco Clean Earth Segment and the change in mix of income in various countries. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to the goodwill impairment recorded for the Harsco Clean Earth Segment, the intangible assets impairment recorded for the Altek business, and the change in mix of income, partially offset by a 6.8 million Brazil tax benefit recorded in 2021 resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets not recurring in 2022. 
 27 

Income tax expense from continuing operations in 2021 was 9.1 million, compared with income tax benefit from continuing operations of 8.7 million in 2020 . The effective income tax rate relating to continued operations for 2021 was 24.2 , versus 16.0 for 2020 . The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in operating income including decreased expenses from corporate strategic spending, disallowed interest expense in 2021 and recognition of net operating loss carrybacks in 2020 not recurring in 2021, offset by a 6.8 million Brazil tax benefit recorded in 2021 resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets as well as the change in mix of income in various foreign countries. 
 
 See Note 11, Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 Gain on Sale of Discontinued Businesses 
 In January 2020, the Company sold IKG and recognized a gain on sale of 18.3 million pre-tax (or approximately 9 million after-tax). 
 
 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Businesses 
 The operating results of the former Harsco Rail Segment and costs directly attributable to the sale of the business, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, this caption includes costs directly attributable to retained contingent liabilities of other previously disposed businesses, which are not significant. The increased loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 was related primarily to the recognition of incremental forward estimated loss provisions of 11.1 million for certain contracts in the Rail business, as well lower business performance due to reduced revenue for railway track maintenance equipment, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of liquidated damages, penalties and costs to complete these contracts may increase, which would result in an additional estimated forward loss provision at such time. 
 
 The primary driver for the loss in 2021, as compared to 2020, is the recognition of forward loss provisions of 33.4 million for certain contracts in the Rail business. 
 
 See Note 3, Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 
 Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Total other comprehensive loss was 11.6 million in 2022, compared with total other comprehensive income of 84.1 million in 2021. The primary driver of the loss in the current year is related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies inclusive of the impact of foreign currency translation of cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses on the Company's pension obligations, reflective of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting this was higher discount rates for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, partially offset by a lower return on plan assets than expected for both plans. 
 
 Total other comprehensive income was 84.1 million in 2021, compared with total other comprehensive loss of 55.3 million in 2020. The primary driver of the increase is due to higher discount rates for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans and a higher return on assets than expected for the U.S. pension plan. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 The Company currently expects to have sufficient financial liquidity and borrowing capacity to support the strategies within each of its businesses. The Company currently expects operational and business needs, in addition to repayment of its current debt maturities, to be met by cash provided by operations, supplemented with borrowings from time to time principally under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Company supplements the cash provided by operations with borrowings from time to time due to historical patterns of seasonal cash flow and the funding of various projects. The Company regularly assesses capital needs in the context of operational trends and strategic initiatives. 
 28 

The Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table: 
 (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided (used) by: Operating activities 150.5 72.2 53.8 Investing activities (99.1) (124.4) (520.6) Financing activities (42.8) 60.2 487.0 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (10.7) (0.5) (0.2) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (2.0) 7.5 19.9 
 Cash provided (used) by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was 150.5 million, an increase of 78.3 million from 2021. The primary drivers of this increase were the sale of 145.0 million of the Company's accounts receivable through its AR Facility and other favorable changes in net working capital, principally related to a decrease in contract assets partially offset by timing of accounts receivable collections. These increases were offset by lower cash net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to prior year. 
 Also included in the Cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is the caption, Other assets and liabilities. A summary of the major components of this caption for the periods presented is as follows: 
 (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided (used) by: Change in income taxes (3.5) 4.8 (1.1) Change in prepaid expenses (5.8) (1.8) (7.4) Change in reserve for contract losses 15.1 13.6 (2.1) Other (a) 
 (15.0) 5.0 9.5 Total change in Other assets and liabilities (9.2) 21.6 (1.1) 
 (a) Other relates primarily to other accruals that are individually not significant. 
 Cash used by investing activities Net cash used by investing activities in 2022 was 99.1 million, a decrease of 25.4 million from 2021. The decrease is primarily due to decreased capital expenditures for HE and higher net proceeds received from the settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from sales of assets. 
 Cash provided (used) by financing activities Net cash used by financing activities in 2022 was 42.8 million, a decrease of 103.0 million from 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower net cash borrowings of 107.7 million, resulting from the use of the AR Facility proceeds to reduce long-term debt. 
 Cash Requirements 
 The Company's expected future payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2022 consist of: 
 Principal payments related to our short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations that are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8, Deb t and Credit Agreements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on short-term borrowings and long-term debt. 
 Projected interest payments on long-term debt are anticipated to be approximately 89.7 million annually based upon borrowings, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022. The interest rates on variable-rate debt and foreign currency exchange rates are subject to changes beyond the Company's control and may result in actual interest expense and payments differing from the projected amounts. 
 Projected facility fee payments on the AR Facility are expected to be 7.6 million annually based on the drawn amount and rates at December 31, 2022. The rates are variable, and are subject to changes beyond the Company's control and may result in facility fees differing from the projected amounts. 
 Purchase obligations representing legally binding obligations to purchase property, plant and equipment, inventory and other commitments made in the normal course of business to meet operations requirements. At December 31, 2022, the Company has 180.1 million of outstanding purchase commitments, of which 138.5 million will be fulfilled in the next twelve months, which includes commitments of 105.7 million related to the Rail business. 
 29 

Operating lease liabilities which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 9, Leases in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Expected employer contributions to defined benefit pension plans for the next year. See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Expected net cash payable of 2.2 million representing the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022. The foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. See Note 15, Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 At December 31, 2022, in addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company had 4.1 million of potential long-term tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash flows associated with these potential long-term tax liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The following table summarizes the Company's contingent commercial commitments at December 31, 2022. These amounts are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since there are no current circumstances known to management indicating that the Company will be required to make payments on these contingent commercial commitments. 
 Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2022 
 Amount of Commercial Commitment Expiration Per Period (In millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over 5 Years Indefinite Expiration Performance bonds 303.9 123.6 154.9 21.1 4.3 Standby letters of credit 80.5 60.8 16.8 3.0 Guarantees 115.9 0.2 1.3 3.6 106.9 3.9 Total commercial commitments (a) 
 500.3 184.6 173.0 24.7 109.9 8.2 
 (a) Includes total commitments of 377.9 million for the Rail business. 
 Certain commercial commitments that are of a continuous nature do not have an expiration date and are therefore considered to be indefinite in nature. See Note 15, Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The Company s principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, augmented by cash proceeds from asset sales. In addition, the Company has other bank credit facilities available throughout the world. The Company expects to continue to utilize all of these sources to meet future cash requirements for operations and growth initiatives.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 
 In February 2022, the Company amended its Senior Credit Facilities to reset the levels of the net debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant. As a result of this amendment, the total net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant was set at 5.50x for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, and decreases quarterly by 0.25x until reaching 4.00x for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 and thereafter. In addition, upon closing on the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment, the total net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant will decrease by an additional 0.25x, provided, however, it will not go below 4.00x and a minimum Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than 3.0x will be maintained. 
 
 In connection with entering into its AR Facility in June 2022, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facilities to increase the permitted maximum outstanding amount of a securitization facility to 150.0 million. Certain other covenants and definitions were also modified to facilitate the AR Facility. The terms of the AR Facility are further described below under Other. 
 
 In August 2022, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility under its Credit Agreement to increase certain levels in the total net leverage covenant, temporarily reduce the ratio under the interest coverage covenant and add a new pricing level applicable to revolving credit loans. Revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate, depending on total net leverage, ranging from 50 to 175 basis points over base rate or 150 to 275 basis points over LIBOR, subject to a zero floor. The Company s total net leverage is capped at 5.50x of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA through the end of 2023; the maximum total net leverage ratio decreases quarterly thereafter, reaching 4.00x for the last quarter in 2024 and thereafter. The total net leverage ratio covenant applicable to the third quarter of 2024 and earlier is subject to a 0.50x decrease upon closing of the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment. The Company s required coverage of consolidated interest charges is set at a minimum of 2.75x of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA through the end of 2024 (subject to an increase to 3.0x upon closing of the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment), and leveling at 3.0x for the first quarter in 2025 and thereafter. Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility remains due and payable on its maturity on March 10, 2026. 
 
 In December 2022, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, change the base rate used in determining loan interest rates from LIBOR to SOFR. This change was in anticipation of the expected cessation of LIBOR in 2023 and in compliance with FASB guidance. In addition, a one-month benchmark adjustment of 11.4 basis points was added to the applicable margins for the Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan, which modified them to 61.4 to 286.4 basis points over term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility and 236.4 basis points over term SOFR for the New Term Loan. The change did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized 1.7 million, 5.5 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of fees and expenses related to amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in the caption Facility fees and debt-related income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a write-off of 2.7 million of previously recorded deferred financing costs. 
 
 The Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions as to types and amounts of debt or liens that may be incurred by the Company; limitations on increases in dividend payments; limitations on repurchases of the Company's stock and limitations on certain acquisitions by the Company. 
 
 With respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of the Company are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company s current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries Guarantors ). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company s assets and the assets of the Guarantors. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires certain mandatory prepayments for the New Term Loan, subject to certain exceptions, based on net cash proceeds of certain sales or distributions of assets, as well as certain casualty and condemnation events, in some cases subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt, excluded permitted debt issuances; and a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined by the Credit Agreement, during a fiscal year.

Revolving Credit Facility 
 Borrowings under the U.S.-based Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum ranging from 50 to 175 basis points over base rate or 161.4 to 286.4 basis points over term SOFR, which includes a one month SOFR adjustment of 11.4 basis points, subject to a 0 floor. Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility is due and payable on its maturity on March 10, 2026. 
 
 The following table shows the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and available credit at December 31, 2022.

 Other 
 In June 2022, the Company repurchased 25.0 million of its 5.75 Senior Notes on the open market at a discount for 22.4 million. The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of 2.3 million, net of the write-off of 0.3 million of previously recorded deferred financing costs, in the caption Facility fees and debt-related income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The Company maintains a trade receivables securitization facility to accelerate cash flows from trade receivables under its AR Facility. The Company and its designated subsidiaries continuously sell their trade receivables as they are originated to its SPE. The SPE transfers ownership and control of qualifying receivables to PNC Bank, up to a maximum purchase commitment of 150.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received proceeds of 145.0 million from the AR Facility. The Company capitalized fees of 1.8 million related to the AR Facility, of which 0.3 million was expensed in the caption Facility fees and debt-related income (expense) on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional details on the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other long-term debt, in addition to Note 4, Ac counts Receivable and Notes Receivable in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional details on the Company's AR Facility. 
 
 Certainty of Cash Flows 
 The majority of the Company's cash flows provided by operations has historically been generated in the second half of the year. The certainty of the Company's future cash flows is underpinned by the long-term nature of the Company's HE services contracts and the recurring nature of revenues within the Clean Earth Segment. 
 The types of products and services that the Company provides are not subject to rapid technological change, which increases the stability of related cash flows. Additionally, the Company believes each business in its portfolio is a leader in the industries and major markets the Company serves. Due to these factors, the Company is confident in the Company's future ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a consolidated net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant, which is not to exceed 5.50x at December 31, 2022, and a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than 2.75x. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with these covenants, with a net leverage ratio of 5.35x and an interest coverage ratio of 3.14x. Based on balances and covenants in effect at December 31, 2022, the Company could increase net debt by 36.6 million and still be in compliance with these debt covenants. Alternatively, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA could decrease by 6.7 million or interest expense could increase by 10.9 million and the Company would remain in compliance with these covenants. The Company believes it will continue to maintain compliance with all covenants over the next twelve months based on its current outlook. However, the Company s estimates of compliance with these covenants could change in the future with a continued deterioration in economic conditions, higher than forecasted interest rate increases, or an inability to successfully execute its plans by quarter to realize increased pricing and to implement cost reduction initiatives that substantially mitigate the impacts of inflation and other factors adversely impacting its realized operating margins.

Cash Management 
 The Company has various cash management systems throughout the world that centralize cash in various bank accounts where it is economically justifiable and legally permissible to do so. These centralized cash balances are then redeployed to other operations to reduce short-term borrowings and to finance working capital needs or capital expenditures. Due to the transitory nature of cash balances, they are normally invested in bank deposits that can be withdrawn at will or in very liquid short-term bank time deposits and government obligations. The Company's policy is to use the largest banks in the various countries in which the Company operates. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of banks and, when appropriate, will adjust banking operations to reduce or eliminate exposure to less creditworthy banks. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents included 79.0 million held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, approximately 17.5 of the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents had regulatory restrictions that would preclude the transfer of funds with and among subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries also held 15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents in consolidated strategic ventures. The strategic venture agreements may require strategic venture partner approval to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries. While the Company's remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents can be transferred with and among subsidiaries, the majority of these non-U.S. cash balances will be used to support the ongoing working capital needs and continued growth of the Company's non-U.S. operations. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its critical accounting estimates, including those related to defined benefit pension benefits, notes and accounts receivable, fair value estimates for business combinations and goodwill, long-lived asset impairment, revenue recognition - cost-to-cost method, and income taxes. The impact of changes in these estimates, as necessary, is reflected in the respective segment's results of operations in the period of the change. The Company bases estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different outcomes, assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by the Company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board and they have reviewed the Company's disclosures relating to these estimates in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. These items should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Defined Benefit Pension Benefits 
 The Company has defined benefit pension plans in several countries. The largest of these plans are in the U.K. and the U.S. The Company's funding policy for these plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding pursuant to U.K. and U.S. statutory requirements, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate. 
 Changes in the discount rate assumption and the actual performance of plan assets, compared with the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, are the primary drivers in the change in funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. These factors are components of actuarial loss (gain) and impact the amount recognized in OCI, as such actuarial changes are not reflected directly on the Consolidated Statements of Operations but amortized over time in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Critical Estimate Defined Benefit Pension Benefits 
 Accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions. The principal assumptions used include the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Each assumption is reviewed annually and represents management's best estimate at that time. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ, in any one year, from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of unfunded benefit obligation and the NPPC recognized. 
 33 

The discount rates used in calculating the Company's projected benefit obligations at the December 31, 2022 measurement date for the U.K. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans were 5.0 and 5.3 , respectively, and the global weighted-average discount rate was 5.1 . The discount rates selected represent level-equivalent rates using the yield curve spot rates on a year-by-year expected cash flow basis, using yield curves of high-quality corporate bonds. Annual NPPC is determined using the discount rates at the beginning of the year. The discount rates for 2022 NPPC were 1.9 for the U.K. plan, 2.7 for the U.S. plans and 2.1 for the global weighted-average of plans. 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by evaluating the asset return expectations with the Company's advisors as well as actual, long-term, historical results of asset returns for the pension plans. Generally, the NPPC increases as the expected long-term rate of return on assets decreases. For 2022 and 2021, the global weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption was 4.7 and 5.1 , respectively. This rate was determined based on a model of expected asset returns for an actively managed portfolio. 
 Changes in NPPC may occur in the future due to changes in actuarial assumptions and due to changes in returns on plan assets resulting from financial market conditions. Holding all other assumptions constant, using December 31, 2022 plan data, a one-quarter percent increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual 2023 pre-tax defined benefit NPPC (expense) as follows: 
 Increase (Decrease) to 2023 NPPC 
 (In millions) U.S. Plans U.K. Plan Discount rate One-quarter percent increase (0.2) One-quarter percent decrease 0.2 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets One-quarter percent increase (0.4) (1.4) One-quarter percent decrease 0.4 1.4 
 Increases or decreases to net pension obligations may be required, should circumstances that affect these estimates change. Additionally, certain events could result in the pension obligation changing at a time other than the annual measurement date. This would occur when a benefit plan is amended or when plan curtailments or settlements occur. 
 See Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value, which represents the face value of the receivable, less an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses is maintained for expected lifetime losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments. 
 
 The Company s expected credit loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. When required, the Company adjusts the loss-rate methodology to account for current conditions and reasonable and supportable expectations of future economic and market conditions. The Company generally assesses future economic conditions for a period which corresponds with the contractual life of its accounts receivable. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, trade accounts receivable of 264.4 million and 377.9 million, respectively, were net of reserves of 8.3 million and 11.7 million, respectively. 
 Critical Estimate Notes and Accounts Receivable 
 A considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the realizability of receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer, related aging of past due balances and the facts and circumstances surrounding any non-payment. The Company's provisions for expected credit losses during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 0.4 million, 0.6 million and 2.0 million, respectively. 
 34 

On at least a quarterly basis, customer accounts are analyzed for collectability. Reserves are established based upon the expected credit loss allowance methodology noted above. Reserves are based on the facts available to the Company and are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. Specific issues are discussed with corporate management and any significant changes in reserve amounts or the write-off of balances must be approved by specifically designated corporate personnel. All approved items are monitored to ensure they are recorded in the proper period. Additionally, any significant changes in reserve balances are reviewed to ensure the proper corporate approval has occurred. 
 If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Conversely, an improvement in a customer's ability to make payments could result in a decrease of the allowance for expected credit losses. Changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to both of these situations would be recorded through Operating income from continuing operations in the period the change was determined. 
 See Note 4, Accounts Receivable and Note Receivable in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. 
 Fair Value Estimates for Business Combinations and Goodwill 
 The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. 
 The Company's goodwill balances were 759.3 million and 883.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1. 
 Critical Estimate Business Combinations and Goodwill 
 The acquisition method of accounting requires the excess of purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities to be recorded as goodwill. The determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of cash flow projections, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, discount rates and useful lives. Such estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and, when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with corresponding offsets to goodwill. 
 In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include declining cash flows or operating losses at the reporting unit level, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of, among others. 
 In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company has the option to perform a qualitative test or a quantitative test. Under the qualitative test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other entity and reporting unit specific events. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company would perform a quantitative test. 
 35 

The quantitative approach of testing for goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the net book value, including goodwill. The Company primarily uses a discounted cash flow model DCF model to estimate the current fair value of reporting units. The Company will apply the DCF model to the reporting units in its operating segments since the Company believes forecasted operating cash flows are the best indicator of current fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models including future revenues, operating margin growth, the weighted-average cost of capital WACC ), tax rates, capital spending, pension funding, the impact of business initiatives and working capital projections. These assumptions and estimates may vary significantly among reporting units. DCF models are based on approved long-range plans for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. WACC rates are derived from internal and external factors including, but not limited to, the average market price of the Company's stock, shares outstanding, book value of the Company's debt, the long-term risk-free interest rate, and both market and size-specific risk premiums. Due to the many variables noted above and the relative size of the Company's goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material impact on the results of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing. If the net book value of a reporting unit were to exceed the current fair value, then an impairment charge would be recognized as the difference between the fair value and the net book value. 
 
 The Company may elect to apply the market approach to estimate the current fair value of reporting units in instances where a reporting unit is in the process of being sold, since current fair value information is readily available. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2022, the Company determined that an interim test of goodwill was required. The triggering event was principally due to lower earnings expectations due to the impacts of inflation. As a result of this interim testing, a goodwill impairment charge of 104.6 million was recorded for the Clean Earth reporting unit, which is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year-ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 The performance of the Company's 2022 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the Company's goodwill. 
 
 The Harsco Environmental reporting unit's estimated fair value at October 1, 2022 was approximately 13 more than the net book value. The goodwill allocated to the Harsco Environmental reporting unit, which is defined as the Harsco Environmental Segment, is 380.0 million at December 31, 2022. The related DCF model for this reporting unit included several key assumptions related to certain price increases and expected realizable cost savings. Significant assumptions utilized in the DCF model include a WACC of 12.0 , an average annual revenue growth rate of 3 and average annual free cash flow growth rate of 3 . Assuming all other factors remain the same, a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the excess of estimated fair value over net book value to 3 ; and, a 1 decrease in the average annual free cash flow growth rate would decrease the excess of estimated fair value over net book value to 4 . 
 
 The Harsco Clean Earth reporting unit's estimated fair value at October 1, 2022 was approximately 9 more than the net book value. The goodwill allocated to the Harsco Clean Earth reporting unit, which is defined as the Harsco Clean Earth Segment, is 379.3 million at December 31, 2022. The related DCF model for this reporting unit included several key assumptions related to certain price increases and expected realizable cost savings. Significant assumptions utilized in the DCF model include a WACC of 12.5 , an average annual revenue growth rate of 4 and average annual free cash flow growth rate of 7 . Assuming all other factors remain the same, a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the estimated fair value to 1 below the net book value; and a 1 decrease in average annual free cash flow growth would reduce the estimated fair value to 1 below the net book value. 
 See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 
 Long-lived Asset Impairment (Other than Goodwill) 
 Long-lived assets (or asset groups) are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The amounts charged against pre-tax income from continuing operations related to impaired long-lived assets (or asset groups), other than definite-lived intangibles, included in Other (income) expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were 0.6 million, 1.0 million and 0.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amounts charged against pre-tax income from continuing operations related to impaired definite-lived intangibles included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were 15.0 million in 2022. There were no definite-lived intangible impairment charges in 2021 and 2020. 
 
 36 

Critical Estimate Asset Impairment 
 The determination of a long-lived asset (or asset group) impairment involves significant judgments based upon short-term and long-term projections of future asset (or asset group) performance. If the undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset (or asset group) do not exceed the asset's book value, impairment loss estimates would be based upon the difference between the book value and fair value of the asset (or asset group). The fair value is generally based upon the Company's estimate of the amount that the assets (or asset group) could be bought or sold for in a transaction between willing parties. If quoted market prices for the asset (or asset group) or similar assets are unavailable, the fair value estimate is generally calculated using a DCF model. Should circumstances change that affect these estimates, additional impairment charges may be required and would be recorded through income in the period the change was determined. 
 There were no significant changes to the Company's methodology for calculating long-lived asset impairments for the years presented. U.S. GAAP requires consideration of all valuation techniques for which market participant inputs can be obtained without undue cost and effort. The use of a DCF model continues to be an appropriate method for determining fair value; however, methodologies such as quoted market prices must also be evaluated. 
 Based on the current economic conditions, to include inflation and higher energy prices, the Company lowered its long-range projections for the Altek Group of the Harsco Environmental Segment. Due to the lower revenue projections, the Company tested the recoverability of Altek's asset group in the fourth quarter of 2022. The asset group primarily consists of technology and customer-related intangible assets. Undiscounted estimated cash flows of the Altek asset group were lower than the carrying value, therefore, the Company used a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of the Altek asset group (Level 3). A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models including future revenues and operating margin growth, the WACC, capital spending, and the impact of business initiatives and working capital projections. The DCF model is based on approved forecasts for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. The WACC rate is based on the Company's WACC, adjusted for market participant assumptions. As a result of this testing, an impairment charge of 15.0 million was recorded, which is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year-ended December 31, 2022. The carrying value of the intangible assets, after the impairment charge, is 15.3 million at December 31, 2022. 
 See Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 18, Other (Income) Expenses, Net in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. 
 Revenue Recognition - Cost-to-Cost Method 
 For certain contracts with customers, which meet specific criteria established in U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on an over time basis utilizing an input method based on costs incurred cost-to-cost method to measure progress, which requires the Company to make estimates regarding the revenues and costs associated with design, manufacturing and delivery of products. 
 Critical Estimate-Revenue Recognition - Cost-to-Cost Method 
 The Company uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress because it is the measure that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as the Company incurs costs under the contracts. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion which includes both actual costs already incurred and the estimated costs to complete. Accounting for contracts with customers using the cost-to-cost method requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues (including estimates of variable consideration, if applicable, as well as estimating any liquidating damages or penalties related to performance); estimating contract costs (including estimating engineering costs to design the machine and the material, labor and overhead manufacturing costs to build the machine); making assumptions for schedule and technical items; properly executing the engineering and design phases consistent with customer expectations; the availability and costs of labor and material resources; productivity; and evaluating whether a significant financing component is present. Due to the number of years it may take to complete certain contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, primarily in Rail, estimating total revenues and costs at completion is inherently complicated and subject to many variables. Accordingly, estimates are subject to change as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of the work under the contract may not have changed. When adjustments in estimated total contract sales or estimated total costs are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized in current period earnings for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract using the cost-to-cost method exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in current period earnings when the loss is determined. Railway track maintenance equipment revenue of approximately 50.0 million was recognized using the cost-to-cost method in 2022, the net profit or loss of which is included, in Income (loss) from discontinued businesses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 37 

Rail is currently manufacturing highly-engineered equipment under large long-term fixed-price contracts with Network Rail, Deutsche Bahn and SBB. As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized an estimated forward loss provision of 33.4 million. In 2022, the Company encountered continued supply chain-related delays and additional costs in building the machines. 
 
 For the Network Rail contracts, the Company encountered supply chain delays in the build of the initial machine and there 
 were further changes to the production schedule based on the manufacturing experience gained from assembling the first unit 
 during the first quarter of 2022, which had a cascading effect on the delivery schedule of remaining machines. During 2022, the Company recorded additional forward loss provisions of 29.1 million, principally for additional estimated contractual liquidated damages as a reduction of revenue, of which 24.2 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2022, 0.3 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2022 and the remaining 4.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company continues to negotiate with Network Rail regarding a reduction to these liquidated damages, which could result in additional favorable or unfavorable adjustments in future periods. 
 
 For the Deutsche Bahn contract, in March 2022 a European-based supplier of critical components to the project, indicated it would be significantly late on the delivery of these components to the project, which has the impact of delaying the overall delivery schedule for the project. Additionally, this supplier filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2022, although it continues to operate. Delays impacting the project, along with rising costs, resulted in additional estimated forward loss provision of 7.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 4.0 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2022 for a total loss provision of 11.5 million in 2022, of which 3.1 million is due to the estimated contractual penalties that would be triggered by the delay and, thus, was recorded as a reduction of revenue. Should this supplier cease operations, the Company may incur further losses if there are additional costs to change suppliers or an inability to recover the value of prepayments made to the supplier, as well as additional penalties and damages under the contract with Deutsche Bahn in the event of further production delays. 
 
 For the second SBB contract, the Company recorded an additional 3.5 million forward estimated loss provision during the first quarter of 2022 due to additional supply chain delays and cost overruns. 
 
 The estimated forward loss provisions represent the Company's best estimate based on currently available information. It is 
 possible that the Company's overall estimate of liquidated damages, penalties and costs to complete these contracts may change, 
 which could result in an additional estimated forward loss provision at such time. 
 
 The first contract with SBB is complete, and the second contract with SBB is 83 complete as of December 31, 2022. The contracts with Network Rail and Deutsche Bahn are 50 and 32 complete, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best estimate of taxes to be paid. The Company is subject to various international, federal, state and local income taxes in jurisdictions where the Company operates. In determining income tax expense, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter and applies that rate to year-to-date income (loss) before income taxes to arrive at the year-to-date income tax provision (exclusive of loss jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is realizable with any discrete tax items recorded separately). At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's annual effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was (8.4) , 24.2 and 16.0 , respectively. 
 
 Critical Estimate Income Taxes 
 Annual effective income tax rates are estimated by giving recognition to currently enacted tax rates, tax holidays, tax credits, capital losses and tax deductions as well as certain exempt income and non-deductible expenses for all jurisdictions where the Company operates. Quarterly income tax provisions incorporate any change in the year-to-date provision from the previous quarterly periods. 
 The Company records deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available evidence, including future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, feasible and prudent tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results. If the Company determines that it will not be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded. If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard for realization, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached. 
 38 

Valuation allowances of 89.2 million and 92.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related principally to deferred tax assets for pension liabilities, NOLs, disallowed interest expense and foreign currency translation that are uncertain as to realizability. At December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a valuation allowance reduction of 7.1 million related to current year pension adjustments recorded through AOCI, a valuation allowance reduction of 6.4 million from the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and a valuation allowance reduction of 4.3 million related to the tax rate reduction in certain jurisdiction in U.S., partially offset by a 5.2 million valuation allowance increase related to current year losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, and a 8.9 million valuation allowance increase related to disallowed interest expense. 
 An income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. The unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 2.8 million and 3.1 million, respectively, excluding accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized income tax benefit may decrease as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations or as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding tax matters in various state and international jurisdictions. 
 The Company did not significantly change the methodology for calculating income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions for the years presented or for quarterly periods. See Note 11, Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of Harsco Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the "Company"), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Harsco Corporation 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Harsco Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 42 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessments Environmental and Clean Earth Reporting Units 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 759 million as of December 31, 2022, and the goodwill associated with the Environmental and Clean Earth reporting units was 380 million and 379 million, respectively. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to dispose of a business. If after assessing qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company would compare the current fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, including goodwill. As of June 30, 2022, the Company determined that an interim test of goodwill was required. The triggering event was principally due to lower earnings expectations due to the impacts of inflation. As a result of this test, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 104.6 million for the Clean Earth reporting unit in the second quarter of 2022. The performance of the Company's 2022 annual impairment tests did not result in any impairment of the Company's goodwill. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair value of the reporting units. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of the discounted cash flow model, including future revenues, operating margin growth, the weighted-average cost of capital, tax rates, capital spending, pension funding, the impact of business initiatives and working capital projections. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments of the Environmental and Clean Earth reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future revenues, operating margin growth, and the weighted-average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Environmental and Clean Earth reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues, operating margin growth, and the weighted-average cost of capital. Evaluating management s assumptions related to future revenues and operating margin growth involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and the reasonableness of the weighted-average cost of capital assumption. 
 
 Revenue Recognition using the Cost-to-Cost Method - Harsco Rail 
 As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, Harsco Rail s total product revenues were 216 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included approximately 50 million related to revenue recognized over time using the cost-to-cost method. The Company uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress because management believes it is the measure that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred under the contracts. Accounting for contracts with customers using the cost-to-cost method requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks; estimating contract revenues (including estimates of variable consideration, if applicable, as well as estimating any liquidating damages or penalties related to performance); estimating contract costs (including estimating engineering costs to design the machine and the material, labor and overhead manufacturing costs to build the machine); making assumptions for schedule and 
 43 

technical items; properly executing the engineering and design phases consistent with customer expectations; the availability and costs of labor and material resources; productivity; and evaluating whether a significant financing component is present. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for Harsco Rail is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated variable consideration and the costs to complete contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to estimating liquidating damages and estimating the engineering costs to design the machine and the manufacturing costs to build the machine. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of estimated contract revenues and costs. These procedures also included, among others, testing management s process for developing the estimated variable consideration and the costs to complete for certain open contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimating liquidating damages and estimating the engineering costs to design the machine and the manufacturing costs to build the machine. Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumption related to estimating liquidating damages involved assessing the likelihood and amount of relief that will be negotiated with the customer. Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumption related to estimating the engineering and manufacturing costs involved considering (i) the costs to complete a contract, including comparing the actual cost of completed contracts to the estimated cost at completion for similar contracts; (ii) using actual costs to date to assess the reasonableness of the estimate of the remaining costs to complete the contract; and (iii) physically observing the progress of open contracts.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. 
 
 The Company's management has evaluated all activity of the Company and concluded that subsequent events are properly reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes as required by U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Liquidity 
 The Company's cash flow forecasts, combined with existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, indicate sufficient liquidity to fund the Company's operations for at least the next twelve months. As such, the Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that it will continue as a going concern for a period extending beyond twelve months from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This assessment includes the expected ability to meet required financial covenants and the continued ability to draw down on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (see Note 8).

million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the restrictions are primarily related to collateral provided for certain guarantees of the Company s performance. 
 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
 Under the AR Facility, the Company and its subsidiaries continuously sell their trade receivables as they are originated to the Company s SPE. The Company controls and, therefore, consolidates the SPE in its consolidated financial statements. The SPE transfers ownership and control of qualifying receivables to the banking counterparty to the AR Facility up to the maximum purchase commitment. The Company and its related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities, and, once sold, the receivables are no longer available to satisfy creditors of the Company or the related subsidiaries. The Company accounts for receivables sold to the banking counterparty as a sale of financial assets and derecognizes the trade receivables from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

million was recognized using the cost-to-cost method in 2022, the net profit or loss of which is included in Income (loss) from discontinued businesses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 For after-market parts sales and Protran/safety equipment, revenue is recognized at the point when control transfers to the customer. Control generally transfers to the customer at the point of shipment for domestic orders and in accordance with the international commercial terms included in contracts for export sales. Transaction prices are based on contracted terms, which are generally fixed, and when the standalone selling price is not directly observable, allocated to performance obligations utilizing an adjusted market assessment approach. Amounts are billed and payable upon completion of each contract. 
 For railway track maintenance services, revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives the benefits provided by the Company's performance. The Company utilizes an appropriate output method based on work performed (feet, miles, shifts worked, etc.) to measure progress, which is deemed to best depict the transfer of value to the customer and revenue earned by the Company. Transaction prices are based on contracted terms, which are generally variable. The variable portion is recognized as services are performed and differs based on the value of services. Given the long-term nature of these arrangements, most contracts permit periodic adjustment based on the changes in macroeconomic indicators. Transaction prices, when the standalone selling price is not directly observable, are allocated to performance obligations utilizing an expected cost plus a margin approach. Amounts are typically billed and payable on a monthly basis as services are performed. 
 
 The Company has elected to utilize the following practical expedients on an ongoing basis: 
 
 The Company has not adjusted the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers the promised good or services to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service would be one year or less; and 
 The Company has elected to exclude disclosures related to unsatisfied performance obligations where the related contract has a duration of one year or less; or where the consideration is entirely variable. Accordingly, the Company's disclosure related to unsatisfied performance obligations is limited to the fixed portion of fees related to metals services in HE.

 million, million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded liabilities of million and million, respectively, related to both asserted as well as unasserted insurance claims. Included in the balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were million and million, respectively, of recognized liabilities covered by insurance carriers. Amounts estimated to be paid within one year have been included in Other current liabilities, with the remainder included in Other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

days or less; however, where appropriate, longer-term contracts may be utilized. For those contracts that are designated as qualified cash flow hedges, gains or losses are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with certain debt issuances in order to secure a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, with changes in value attributed to the effect of the swaps interest spread and changes in the credit worthiness of the counter-parties recorded in AOCI. 
 Amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The cash flows from these contracts are classified consistent with the cash flows from the transaction being hedged (e.g., the cash flows related to contracts to hedge the purchase of fixed assets are included in cash flows from investing activities, etc.). The Company also enters into certain forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in operations based on changes in fair market value. For fair value hedges of a firm commitment, the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged firm commitment are recognized currently in operations.

 (a) The decrease in product revenues for 2022, as compared to 2021 and 2020, is due in part to liquidated damages and penalties on certain long-term contracts, as discussed below. 
 (b) The Company includes costs to sell the Rail business in the caption Income (loss) from discontinued businesses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The Company has retained corporate overhead expenses previously allocated to the former Harsco Rail Segment of million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 as part of Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The Company's former Harsco Rail segment is currently manufacturing highly-engineered equipment under large long-term fixed-price contracts with Network Rail, Deutsche Bahn and SBB. As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2021 the Company recognized an estimated forward loss provision of million related to these contracts. In 2022, the Company encountered continued supply chain related delays and additional costs in building the machines. 
 
 59 

million, principally for additional estimated contractual liquidated damages as a reduction of revenue, of which million was recorded in the first quarter of 2022, million was recorded in the second quarter of 2022 and million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company continues to negotiate with Network Rail regarding a reduction to these liquidated damages, which could result in additional favorable or unfavorable adjustments in future periods. 
 
 For the Deutsche Bahn contract, in March 2022 a European-based supplier of critical components to the project, indicated it would be significantly late on the delivery of these components to the project, which has the impact of delaying the overall delivery schedule for the project. Additionally, this supplier filed for bankruptcy during the second quarter of 2022, although it continues to operate. Delays impacting the project, along with rising costs, resulted in an additional estimated forward loss provision of million in the first quarter of 2022 and million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 for a total loss provision of million in 2022, of which million is due to the estimated contractual penalties that would be triggered by the delay and thus recorded as a reduction of revenue. Should this supplier cease operations, the Company may incur further losses if there are additional costs to change suppliers or if there is an inability to recover the value of prepayments made to the supplier, as well as incur additional penalties and damages under the contract with Deutsche Bahn in the event of further production delays. 
 
 For the second SBB contract, the Company recorded an additional million forward estimated loss provision in the first quarter of 2022 due to additional supply chain delays and cost overruns. 
 
 The estimated forward loss provisions represent the Company's best estimate based on currently available information. It is possible that the Company's overall estimate of liquidated damages, penalties and costs to complete these contracts may change, which could result in an additional estimated forward loss provision at such time. 
 
 The first contract with SBB is complete, and the second contract is complete as of December 31, 2022. The contracts with Network Rail and Deutsche Bahn are and complete, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.

 (a) The December 31, 2021 amounts for trade accounts receivable and allowance for expected credit losses have been revised from the presentation in the Company's 2021 Form 10-K. This revision did not impact trade accounts receivable, net. 
 (b) The decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses is principally due to the write-off of previously reserved trade accounts receivable balances. 
 (c) Other receivables include employee receivables, insurance receivable, tax claims and refunds and other miscellaneous receivables not included in Trade accounts receivable, net.

At December 31, 2022, million of the Company's trade accounts receivable were past due by twelve months or more, with million of this amount reserved. There has been a recent increase in aged receivables for certain international customers within the Harsco Environmental Segment. Collection of the remaining balance is still ultimately expected. 
 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility 
 In June 2022, the Company and its SPE entered into an AR Facility with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC") to accelerate cash flows from trade accounts receivable. The AR Facility has a three-year term. The maximum purchase commitment by PNC is million. 
 
 The total outstanding balance of trade receivables that have been sold and derecognized by the SPE is million as of December 31, 2022. The SPE owned million of trade receivables as of December 31, 2022, which are included in the caption Trade accounts receivable, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 In 2022, the Company capitalized fees of million related to the AR Facility. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements, for facility expenses incurred.

 Note Receivable 
 In January 2020, the Company sold IKG for million including cash and a note receivable, subject to post-closing adjustments. The note receivable from the buyer has a face value of million, bearing interest at , that is paid in kind and matures on January 31, 2027. Any unpaid principal, along with any accrued but unpaid interest is payable at maturity. Prepayment is required in case of a change in control or as a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined in the note receivable agreement. Because there are no scheduled payments under the terms of the note receivable, the balance is not classified as current and is included in the caption Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial fair value of the note receivable was million which was calculated using an average of various discounted cash flow scenarios based on anticipated timing of repayments (Fair Value Level 3 asset) and was a non-cash transaction. The note receivable is subsequently measured at amortized cost. Key inputs into the valuation model include: projected timing and amount of cash flows, pro forma debt rating, option-adjusted spread and U.S. Treasury spot rate. The Company received payments of million and million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to excess cash flow.

 million. The customer has entered into an agreement with the government where it will receive compensation for the losses the customer has incurred as a result of the forced shutdown. The Company has continued discussions with the customer regarding compensation, which are expected to be protracted. While the customer has initially indicated that they will not provide compensation, the Company and the customer continue to discuss. In addition, there may be other avenues of pursuing recovery, including seeking relief directly from the local government. At this point, considering the ongoing discussions with the customer, and other avenues, the Company believes it will recover the book value of the equipment and thus does not believe it has an asset impairment as of December 31, 2022. However, the Company will continue to evaluate changes in facts and circumstances and record any impairment charge when and if indicated.

 Based on the current economic conditions, to include inflation and higher energy prices, the Company lowered its long-range projections for the Altek Group of the Harsco Environmental Segment. Due to the lower revenue projections, the Company tested the recoverability of Altek's asset group in the fourth quarter of 2022. The asset group primarily consists of technology and customer-related intangible assets. Undiscounted estimated cash flows of the Altek asset group were lower than the carrying value, therefore, the Company used a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of the Altek asset group (Level 3). A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the preparation of DCF models including future revenues and operating margin growth, the WACC, capital spending, and the impact of business initiatives and working capital projections. The DCF model is based on approved forecasts for the early years and historical relationships and projections for later years. The WACC rate is based on the Company's WACC, adjusted for market participant assumptions. As a result of this testing, an impairment charge of million was recorded, which is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year-ended December 31, 2022. The carrying value of the intangible assets, after the impairment charge, is million at December 31, 2022.

 Cash payments for interest on debt were million, million and million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 In February 2022, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to reset the levels of its net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant. As a result of this amendment, the total net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant was set at x for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, and decreases quarterly by x until reaching x for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 and thereafter. In addition, upon closing on the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment, the total net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant will decrease by an additional x, provided, however, it will not go below x and a minimum Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest charges ratio covenant, which is not to be less than x will be maintained. 
 
 In June 2022, the Company repurchased million of its Senior Notes on the open market at a discount for million. The Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of million, net of the write-off of million of previously recorded deferred financing costs, in the caption Facility fees and debt-related income (expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 In connection with entering into its AR Facility in June 2022, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facilities to increase the permitted maximum outstanding amount of a securitization facility to million. Certain other covenants and definitions were also modified to facilitate the AR Facility. 
 
 In August 2022, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility under its Credit Agreement to increase certain levels in the total net leverage covenant, temporarily reduce the ratio under the interest coverage covenant and add a new pricing level applicable to revolving credit loans. Revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate, depending on total net leverage, ranging from to basis points over base rate or to basis points over LIBOR, subject to a floor. The Company s total net leverage is capped at x of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA through the end of 2023; the maximum total net leverage ratio decreases quarterly thereafter, reaching x for the last quarter in 2024 and thereafter. The total net leverage ratio covenant applicable to the third quarter of 2024 and earlier is subject to a x decrease upon closing of the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment. The Company s required coverage of consolidated interest charges is set at a minimum of x of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA through the end of 2024 (subject to an increase to x upon closing of the divestiture of the former Harsco Rail Segment), and leveling at x for the first quarter in 2025 and thereafter. Any principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility remains due and payable on its maturity on March 10, 2026.

basis points was added to the applicable margins for the Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan, which modified them to to basis points over term SOFR for the Revolving Credit Facility and basis points over term SOFR for the New Term Loan. The change did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants for its Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended in August 2022, as the total net debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA ratio was x and the total interest coverage ratio was x. 
 
 The Company believes it will continue to maintain compliance with all covenants over the next twelve months based on its current outlook. However, the Company s estimates of compliance with these covenants could change in the future with a continued deterioration in economic conditions, higher than forecasted interest rate increases, or an inability to successfully execute its plans by quarter to realize increased pricing and to implement cost reduction initiatives that substantially mitigate the impacts of inflation and other factors adversely impacting its realized operating margins. 
 
 The Company's Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions as to types and amounts of debt of liens that may be incurred by the Company; limitations on increases in dividend payments; limitations on repurchases of the Company's stock and limitations on certain acquisitions by the Company. 
 
 With respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of the Company are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company s current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries Guarantors ). All obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company s assets and the assets of the Guarantors. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires certain mandatory prepayments of the New Term Loan, subject to certain exceptions, based on net cash proceeds of certain sales or distributions of assets, as well as certain casualty and condemnation events, in some cases subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; net cash proceeds of any issuance of debt, excluding permitted debt issuances; and a percentage of excess cash flow, as defined by the Credit Agreement, during a fiscal year.

 Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets 
 The expected long-term rates of return on defined benefit pension plan assets for the 2023 NPPC are for the U.S. plans and for the international plans. The expected global long-term rate of return on assets for 2023 is . 
 
 Since accrued service is no longer granted to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the majority of the international defined benefit pension plans, the rate of compensation increase did not have a significant impact on the defined benefit pension obligation at December 31, 2022 and 2021 or the defined benefit pension plan NPPC for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 The U.S. discount rate was determined using a yield curve that was produced from a universe containing approximately 1,100 U.S. dollar-denominated, AA-graded corporate bonds, all of which were noncallable (or callable with make-whole provisions) and excluding the of the bonds with the highest deviation from the expected yield and the with the lowest deviation from the expected yield within each duration group. The discount rate was then developed as the level-equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates to discount the projected benefit payments. For international plans, the discount rate is aligned to corporate bond yields in the local markets, normally AA-rated corporations. The process and selection seek to approximate the cash inflows with the timing and amounts of the expected benefit payments.

 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the defined benefit pension plans' investments measured at fair value: 
 Level 1 Fair Value Measurements Investments in interest-bearing cash are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of money market accounts and certain mutual funds are based on quoted net asset values of the shares held by the plan at year-end. The fair values of domestic and international stocks and corporate bonds, notes and convertible debentures are valued at the closing price reported in the active market on which the individual securities are traded. 
 Level 2 Fair Value Measurements The fair values of investments in mutual funds for which quoted net asset values in an active market are not available are valued by the investment advisor based on the current market values of the underlying assets of the mutual fund based on information reported by the investment consistent with audited financial statements of the mutual fund. Further information concerning these mutual funds may be obtained from their separate audited financial statements. Investments in U.S. Treasury notes and collateralized securities are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.

Brazil has 3 years of cumulative income and expects to utilize the deferred tax assets against future income. Also, in 2021, the Company recorded a million nontaxable capital gain on the sale of U.K. assets not recurring in 2022. In 2022, the Company recorded a million intangible assets impairment for the Altek business with tax benefit.

 Valuation allowances of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related principally to deferred tax assets for pension liabilities, NOLs, disallowed interest expense and foreign currency translation that are uncertain as to realizability. In 2022, the Company recorded a valuation allowance reduction of million related to current year pension adjustment recorded through AOCI, a valuation allowance reduction of million from the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments and a valuation allowance reduction of million related to the tax rate reduction in certain jurisdiction in U.S, partially offset by a million valuation allowance increase related to current year losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, and a million valuation allowance increase related to disallowed interest expense. 
 The Tax Act introduced a transition tax and a territorial tax system, which was effective beginning in 2018. The territorial tax system impacts the Company's overall global capital and legal entity structure, working capital, and repatriation plan on a go-forward basis. The Company asserts that all foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested to meet local cash needs. The Company therefore intends to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the percent dividends received deduction provided for in the Tax Act, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes.

 Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a defendant or party to various claims and lawsuits, including those discussed below. 
 
 On March 28, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA conducted an inspection of ESOL s off-site waste management facility in Detroit, MI. On November 23, 2021, the EPA proposed a civil penalty of as part of a proposed Administrative Consent Order for alleged improper air emissions at the site. The allegations in the proposed Administrative Consent Order and civil penalty relate exclusively to the period prior the Company s purchase of the ESOL business. The Company is vigorously contesting the allegations. While it is the Company's position that any loss related to this issue will be recoverable under indemnity rights under the ESOL purchase agreement and representations and warranties insurance policies purchased by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company's position will ultimately prevail. On August 31, 2022, the parties executed a Tolling Agreement, which excludes the period from March 1, 2022 through December 30, 2022, for the purposes of calculating the statute of limitations and other related defenses. 
 
 On January 27, 2020, the U.S. EPA issued a Notice of Potential Liability to the Company, along with several other companies, concerning the Newtown Creek Superfund Site located in Kings and Queens Counties in New York. The Notice alleges certain facilities formerly owned or operated by subsidiaries of the Company may have resulted in the discharge of hazardous substances into Newtown Creek or its Dutch Kills tributary. The site has been subject to CERCLA response activities since approximately 2011. The U.S. EPA expects to propose a sitewide cleanup plan no sooner than 2024 and announced, in July 2021, that it would defer its decision on a potential early action response for the lower two miles of the Creek until the sitewide studies are completed. The Company is one of approximately twenty (20) Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") that have received notices, though it is believed other PRPs may exist. The Company vigorously contests the allegations of the Notice and currently does not believe that this matter will have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results from operations. 
 
 On June 25 and 26, 2018, the DTSC conducted a compliance enforcement inspection of ESOL s facility in Rancho Cordova, California, which was then owned by Stericycle, Inc. On February 14, 2020, the DTSC filed an action in the Superior Court for the State of California, Sacramento Division, alleging violations of California s Hazardous Waste Control Law and the facility s hazardous waste permit arising from the inspection. On August 27, 2020 the DTSC issued a Notice of Denial of Hazardous Waste Facility Permit Application, denying the renewal of the facility's hazardous waste permit. The Company has exhausted its legal challenges to the denial of the Hazardous Waste facility permit, and the hazardous waste facility is in the process of closing. The Company continues to utilize the site for non-hazardous waste and is evaluating additional potential alternate uses for the site. The DTSC investigation and compliance issues leading to the compliance tier assignment were ongoing well before the Company's acquisition of the ESOL business, and the Company was aware of the investigation and many of the issues raised in the investigation at the time of the purchase. Accordingly, the Company is indemnified for certain fines and other costs and expenses associated with this matter by Stericycle, Inc. The Company has not accrued any amounts in respect of these alleged violations and cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or the range of reasonably possible losses that it may incur.

million at December 31, 2022 continues to represent the Company's best estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to resolve this matter. The Company continues to evaluate this reserve and any future change in estimated costs, which could be material to the in any one period. 
 
 On July 27, 2018 Brazil s Federal and Rio de Janeiro State Public Prosecution Offices (MPF and MPE) filed a Civil Public Action against one of the Company's customers (CSN), the Company s Brazilian subsidiary, the Municipality of Volta Redonda, Brazil, and the Instituto Estadual do Ambiente (local environmental protection agency) seeking the implementation of various measures to limit and reduce the accumulation of customer-owned slag at the site in Brazil. On August 6, 2018 the 3rd Federal Court in Volta Redonda granted the MPF and MPE an injunction against the same parties requiring, among other things, CSN and the Company s Brazilian subsidiary to limit the volume of slag sent to the site. Because the customer owns the site and the slag located on the site, the Company believes that complying with this injunction is the steel producer s responsibility. On March 18, 2019 the Court issued an order fining the Company Brazilian reais per day (or approximately thousand per day) and CSN Brazilian reais per day (or approximately thousand per day) until the requirements of the injunction are met. On November 1, 2019 the Court issued an additional order increasing the fines assessed to the Company to Brazilian reais per day (or approximately thousand per day) and raising the fines assessed to CSN to Brazilian reais per day (or approximately thousand per day). The Court also assessed an additional fine of Brazilian reais (or approximately million) against CSN and the Company jointly. The Company is appealing the fines and the underlying injunction. Both the Company and CSN continue to have discussions with the Prosecution Offices and governmental authorities on the injunction and the possible resolution of the underlying case. Beginning on March 25, 2022, the Courts entered a series of orders suspending the litigation proceedings, as well as the accrual of interest and penalties while the parties discuss a possible resolution of the matter. The Company does not believe that a loss relating to this matter is probable or estimable at this point. 
 
 On October 19, 2018 local environmental authorities issued an enforcement action against the Company concerning the Company s operations at a customer site in Ijmuiden, Netherlands. The enforcement action alleged violations of the Company s environmental permit at the site, which restricts the release of any visible dust emissions. On January 12, 2022, the Administrative Supreme Court upheld the Company s challenge of these enforcement actions as they relate to the slag tipping area of the site. As a result, all fines asserted against the Company to date have been invalidated and all fines paid to date have been reimbursed. This order is not appealable. On or about October 14, 2021, the Company received a subpoena and two indictments on this matter before the Amsterdam District Court in the Netherlands. The Amsterdam Public Prosecutor s Office issued the two indictments against the Company, alleging violations in connection with dust releases and/or events alleged to have occurred in 2018 through May 2020 at the site. The action cites provisions which permit fines for the alleged infractions and seeks in fines with a smaller amount held in abeyance. On February 2, 2022, the prosecutor announced that they would further investigate residents claims related to this matter. On February 25, 2022, the Amsterdam District Court ruled that the Company was liable for only one alleged violation and that this alleged violation was unintentional. The court issued a fine of , to be held in abeyance. Both the Company and the Public Prosecutor s Office have appealed this ruling. The Company is vigorously contesting all allegations against it and is also working with its customer to ensure the control of emissions. The Company has contractual indemnity rights from its customer that it believes will substantially cover any fines or penalties. 
 
 On November 5, 2020, a worker suffered a fatal injury at a site owned by the Company s customer, Gerdau Ameristeel US, Inc., in Midlothian, TX. Although the Company was not directly involved in the accident, the worker was employed by a sub-contractor of a sub-contractor of the Company. The worker s family filed suit in the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, TX against multiple parties including the Company. By a letter agreement dated December 1, 2022, the worker's family agreed to settle their claims against the Company and Gerdau. The parties are working to complete a formal settlement agreement. The Company has recorded a liability for its insurance deductible of million and an indemnification receivable from its customer for the recovery of certain losses based upon the contractual indemnity rights. There can be no assurances that the Company's position will ultimately prevail; however, any financial statement impact is not expected to be material.

. The Company is currently reviewing the veracity of the allegations and the corresponding proposed penalty amount and has recorded a liability of as its best estimate to resolve this matter. While it is the Company s position that it has recourse for some or all liabilities, if any, that arise from this matter under the ESOL purchase agreement and representations and warranties insurance policies purchased by the Company, there can be no assurances that the Company s position will ultimately prevail. 
 
 On March 21, 2022, the Company received a draft penalty matrix from the PA DEP concerning alleged reporting, monitoring and related issues at the Company s Hatfield, PA site prior to the time the Company acquired the site from Stericycle. The draft penalty matrix proposes a penalty of . On June 29, 2022, the PA DEP issued a draft Consent Assessment of Civil Penalty ("CACP") related to the alleged issues at the site. The Company and PA DEP have reached an agreement in principle to settle PA DEP's claims for , which has been recorded as a liability. The parties are working to draft a final CACP. While it is the Company s position that it has recourse for some or all liabilities that arise from this matter under the ESOL purchase agreement and representations and warranties insurance policies purchased by the Company, there can be no assurances that the Company s position will ultimately prevail. 
 
 DEA Investigation 
 Prior to the Company s acquisition of ESOL, Stericycle, Inc., notified the Company that the DEA had served an administrative subpoena on Stericycle, Inc. and executed a search warrant at a facility in Rancho Cordova, California and an administrative inspection warrant at a facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Company has determined that the DEA and the DTSC have launched investigations involving, at least in part, the ESOL business of collecting, transporting, and destroying controlled substances from retail customers that transferred from Stericycle, Inc. to the Company. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries, which relate primarily to the period before the Company owned the ESOL business. Since the acquisition of the ESOL business, the Company has performed a vigorous review of ESOL s compliance program related to controlled substances and has made material changes to the manner in which controlled substances are transported from retail customers to DEA-registered facilities for destruction. The Company has not accrued any amounts in respect of these investigations and cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or the range of reasonably possible losses that it may incur, if any. Investigations of this type are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable. While it is the Company s position that it has recourse for some or all liabilities, if any, that arise from these matters under the ESOL purchase agreement and representations and warranties insurance policies purchased by the Company, there can be no assurances that the Company s position will ultimately prevail. 
 
 Brazilian Tax Disputes 
 The Company is involved in a number of tax disputes with federal, state and municipal tax authorities in Brazil. These disputes are at various stages of the legal process, including the administrative review phase and the collection action phase, and include assessments of fixed amounts of principal and penalties, plus interest charges that increase at statutorily determined amounts per month and are assessed on the aggregate amount of the principal and penalties. In addition, the losing party, at the collection action or court of appeals phase, could be subject to a charge to cover statutorily mandated legal fees, which are generally calculated as a percentage of the total assessed amounts due, inclusive of penalty and interest. Many of the claims relate to ICMS, services and social security tax disputes. The largest proportion of the assessed amounts relate to ICMS claims filed by the SPRA, encompassing the period from January 2002 to May 2005. 
 
 In October 2009 the Company received notification of the SPRA s final administrative decision regarding the levying of ICMS in the State of S o Paulo in relation to services provided to a customer in the State between January 2004 and May 2005. As of December 31, 2022, the principal amount of the tax assessment from the SPRA with regard to this case is approximately million, with penalty, interest and fees assessed to date increasing such amount by an additional million. On June 4, 2018, the Appellate Court of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of the SPRA but ruled that the assessed penalty should be reduced to approximately million. After calculating the interest accrued on the penalty, the Company estimates that this ruling reduces the current overall potential liability for this case to approximately million. All such amounts include the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company has appealed the ruling in favor of the SPRA to the Superior Court of Justice. Due to multiple court precedents in the Company's favor, as well as the Company's ability to appeal, the Company does not believe a loss is probable.

million (the amounts with regard to this claim are valued as of the date of the assessment since it has not yet reached the collection phase), composed of a principal amount of million, with penalty and interest assessed through that date increasing such amount by an additional million. On December 6, 2018, the administrative tribunal reduced the applicable penalties to million. After calculating the interest accrued on the current penalty, the Company estimates that the current overall liability for this case to be approximately million. All such amounts include the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company has appealed to the judicial phase at the Third Trial Court of the District of Cubat o, State of S o Paulo. On October 14, 2022, the District Court issued a decision holding that the Company is not liable for the taxes at issue. Due to multiple court precedents in the Company's favor, the Company does not believe a loss is probable. 
 
 The Company continues to believe that sufficient coverage for these claims exists as a result of the indemnification obligations of the Company's customer and such customer s pledge of assets in connection with the October 2009 notice, as required by Brazilian law. 
 
 On December 30, 2020, the Company received an assessment from the municipal authority in Ipatinga, Brazil alleging million in unpaid service taxes from the period 2015 to 2020. After calculating the interest and penalties accrued, the Company estimates that the current overall potential liability for this case to be approximately million. On January 18, 2021, the Company filed a challenge to the assessment. Due to the multiple defenses that are available, the Company does not believe a loss is probable. 
 
 The Company intends to continue its practice of vigorously defending itself against these tax claims under various alternatives, including judicial appeal. The Company will continue to evaluate its potential liability with regard to these claims on a quarterly basis; however, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these tax-related disputes in Brazil. loss provision has been recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the disputes described above because the loss contingency is not deemed probable, and the Company does not expect that any costs that are reasonably possible to be incurred by the Company in connection with Brazilian tax disputes would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Other 
 The Company is named as one of many defendants (approximately or more in most cases) in legal actions in the U.S. alleging personal injury from exposure to airborne asbestos over the past several decades. In their suits, the plaintiffs have named as defendants, among others, many manufacturers, distributors and installers of numerous types of equipment or products that allegedly contained asbestos. 
 The Company believes that the claims against it are without merit. The Company has never been a producer, manufacturer or processor of asbestos fibers. Any asbestos-containing part of a Company product used in the past was purchased from a supplier and the asbestos encapsulated in other materials such that airborne exposure, if it occurred, was not harmful and is not associated with the types of injuries alleged in the pending actions. 
 At December 31, 2022, there were pending asbestos personal injury actions filed against the Company. Of those actions, were filed in the New York Supreme Court (New York County), were filed in other New York State Supreme Court Counties and were filed in courts located in other states. 
 The complaints in most of those actions generally follow a form that contains a standard damages demand of million or million, regardless of the individual plaintiff's alleged medical condition, and without identifying any specific Company product. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, of the actions filed in New York Supreme Court (New York County) were on the Deferred/Inactive Docket created by the court in December 2002 for all pending and future asbestos actions filed by persons who cannot demonstrate that they have a malignant condition or discernible physical impairment. The remaining cases in New York County are pending on the Active or In Extremis Docket created for plaintiffs who can demonstrate a malignant condition or physical impairment. 
 
 The Company has liability insurance coverage under various primary and excess policies that the Company believes will be available, if necessary, to substantially cover any liability that might ultimately be incurred in the asbestos actions referred to above. The costs and expenses of the asbestos actions are being paid by the Company s insurers. 
 80 

cases by stipulation or summary judgment prior to trial. 
 It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related actions in the U.S. due to the unpredictable nature of this litigation, and loss provision has been recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements because a loss contingency is not deemed probable or estimable. Despite this uncertainty, and although results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related actions, the Company does not expect that any costs that are reasonably possible to be incurred by the Company in connection with asbestos litigation would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The Company is subject to various other claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arose in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, all such matters are adequately covered by insurance or by established reserves, and, if not so covered, are without merit or are of such kind, or involve such amounts, as would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 
 Insurance liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred for a particular event and the amount of loss associated with the event can be reasonably estimated. Insurance reserves have been estimated based primarily upon actuarial calculations and reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported. Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends. If actual claims differ from those projected by management, changes (either increases or decreases) to insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded through income in the period the change was determined. When a recognized liability has been determined to be covered by third-party insurance, the Company records an insurance claim receivable to reflect the covered liability. Insurance claim receivables are included in Other receivables on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on Accrued insurance and loss reserves.

 The Board approves the granting of SARs to officers and certain key employees under the 2013 Plan. The SARs generally vest on a pro-rata basis from the grant date or upon specified retirement or years of service criteria and expire no later than after the grant date. The exercise price of the SARs is equal to the fair value of Harsco common stock on the grant date. Upon exercise, shares of the Company's common stock are issued based on the increase in the fair value of the Company's common stock over the exercise price of the SAR.

The expiration periods of the standby letters of credit, bonds and bank guarantees range from less than year to over years, but the majority are generally in force for approximately years. Certain issues have no scheduled expiration date. The Company pays fees to various banks and insurance companies that typically range from approximately to per annum of the instrument's face value. If the Company were required to obtain replacement standby letters of credit, bonds and bank guarantees at December 31, 2022 for those currently outstanding, it is the Company's opinion that the replacement costs would be within the present fee structure. 
 
 The Company has currency exposures in approximately countries. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures during 2022 were in the European Union, the U.K., Brazil and China. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Risk Third-Party Guarantees 
 Any liabilities related to the Company's obligation to stand ready to act on third-party guarantees are included in Other current liabilities or Other liabilities (as appropriate) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any recognition of these liabilities did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations for 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 In the normal course of business, legal indemnifications are provided related primarily to the performance of the Company's products and services and patent and trademark infringement of the products and services sold. These indemnifications generally relate to the performance (regarding function, not price) of the respective products or services and, therefore, liability is recognized related to the fair value of such guarantees.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts 
 The Company conducts business in multiple currencies and, accordingly, is subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. 
 
 The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge cash flows related to foreign currency fluctuations. The outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts are part of a worldwide program to minimize foreign currency exchange operating income and balance sheet exposure by offsetting foreign currency exposures of certain future payments between the Company and various subsidiaries, suppliers or customers. The unsecured contracts are with major financial institutions. The Company may be exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the contract counterparties. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and does not expect default by them. Foreign currency exchange forward contracts are used to hedge commitments, such as foreign currency debt, firm purchase commitments and foreign currency cash flows for certain export sales transactions. 
 Changes in the fair value of derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings, along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate, if the criteria for hedge accounting are met. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI, a separate component of equity, and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized currently in earnings. 
 The recognized gains and losses offset amounts recognized in cost of sales sold principally as a result of intercompany or third-party foreign currency exposures. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the notional amounts of foreign currency exchange forward contracts were million and million, respectively. These contracts primarily hedge British pounds sterling and Euros against other currencies and mature through December 2023.

million during 2022 related to hedges of net investments, and pre-tax net gains of million and million during 2021 and 2020, respectively, in AOCI. 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with certain variable rate debt issuances in order to secure a fixed interest rate. Changes in the fair value attributed to the effect of the swaps interest spread and changes in the credit worthiness of the counter-parties are recorded in AOCI. 
 
 The Company had a series of interest rate swaps that were in effect through 2022 and matured in December 2022. These swaps had the effect of converting million of the New Term Loan from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. The fixed rates provided by the swaps replaced the adjusted LIBOR rate in the interest calculation, ranging from for 2021 to for 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the interest rate swaps were deemed ineffective and, thus, the subsequent changes in fair value were recorded in earnings in the current period. The amounts previously recorded in AOCI were amortized into earnings over the remaining maturity of the interest rate swap. 
 
 In January 2023, the Company entered into a new series of interest rate swaps with a scheduled maturity date of December 2025. The swaps have the effect of converting million of the New Term Loan from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. The fixed rates provided by the swaps replace the adjusted SOFR rate in the interest calculation, ranging from to . 
 
 Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was million and million, respectively, compared with a carrying value of million and million, respectively. Fair values for debt are based upon pricing models using market-based inputs (Level 2) for similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any single institution. 
 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable exist in HE, which have several large customers throughout the world with significant accounts receivable balances. Consolidation in the global steel could result in an increase in concentration of credit risk for the Company. CE also has significant sales to several U.S. customers. 
 The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. If a receivable from one or more of the Company's larger customers becomes uncollectible, it could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

 In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Harsco Environmental Segment had customer that provided in excess of 10 of this Segment's revenues under multiple long-term contracts at several mill sites. Should additional consolidations occur involving some of the steel industry's larger companies which are customers of the Company, it would result in an increase in concentration of credit risk for the Company. The loss of any one of the contracts would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position or cash flows; however, it could have a significant effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. 
 
 In 2022, 2021, and 2020, Harsco Clean Earth had customer that provided in excess of 10 of the Segment's revenue.

Exhibit 4(a) 
 HARSCO CORPORATION 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 The following summary description of our common stock is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as further amended or restated, which we refer to in this exhibit as the Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated By-Laws, which we refer to in this exhibit as the Bylaws, and applicable provisions of the laws of Delaware, our state of incorporation, including without limitation the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ). These statements do not purport to be complete, or to give full effect to the terms of the provisions of statutory or common law, and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, each of which has been filed as an exhibit to (or incorporated by reference in) our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and to applicable provisions of Delaware law. 
 
 General 
 
 Harsco Corporation (the Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and currently is authorized by its Certificate of Incorporation to issue up to 154,000,000 shares, of which 4,000,000 shares are to be preferred stock of the par value of 1.25 per share and 150,000,000 shares are to be common stock of the par value of 1.25 per share. While at present the Company has only shares of common stock issued and outstanding, our Board of Directors is authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation to provide in the future for issuance of the authorized preferred stock in one or more series, with such voting powers (full or limited, or without voting powers) and with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be established by our Board of Directors at such time. 
 
 Listing, Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 
 The Company s common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol HSC. The Transfer Agent and Registrar for our common stock is Computershare Investor Services. 
 
 Dividend and Liquidation Rights No Preemptive or Conversion Rights 
 
 Subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time, holders of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as are declared by the Board of Directors from any funds legally available therefor, and to share ratably in assets available for distribution upon any liquidation. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and have no rights to convert their common stock into any other securities, and common stock is not subject to redemption or to any further call or assessment. 
 
 Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 
 Voting Rights and Election of Directors. Except as might otherwise be provided in any resolutions of the Board of Directors establishing the terms of a future series of preferred stock, holders of our common stock have the exclusive right to elect directors and are entitled to one 

vote per share on all matters submitted for action by the stockholders. Shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on any matter, represented in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders, constitute a quorum for the transaction of business with respect to such matter. All matters to be voted on by stockholders, other than the election of directors, will be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares entitled to vote thereon and represented in person or by proxy at the meeting, unless a different vote is required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable stock exchange rules. 
 
 Holders of common stock may not cumulate votes for the election of directors. Subject to the rights of any one or more series of preferred stock to elect directors in a separate class vote, both our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws provide that in an uncontested election of directors (that is, an election where the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), each director nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in order to be elected, meaning that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of shares voted against that director. Under both the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, in any election of directors where there are more nominees for election than the number of directors to be elected, as a result of a timely nomination by one or more stockholders in accordance with applicable requirements of the Bylaws, director nominees shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. The Bylaws further provide that no person who shall have attained the age of 72 shall be eligible for election as a director unless he or she shall have been nominated by a three-fourths vote of the Board of Directors and, except as otherwise required by law, each director elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. 
 
 Our Bylaws also include a director resignation policy, pursuant to which any incumbent director nominee who does not receive the required majority vote in an uncontested director election (i.e., an election of directors where the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected) will be required to submit a conditional resignation to the Secretary of the Company. The Governance Committee of the Board (or another committee designated by the Board) must then consider the facts and circumstances relating to the election and the resignation of such incumbent director and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will then act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days following certification of the election results. If a director s resignation is not accepted by the Board, then such director would, except as otherwise required by law, continue to serve on the Board until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such time as his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, unconditional resignation or removal. 
 
 Under our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, any vacancy on our Board caused by a director s death, resignation, disqualification or removal, or an increase in the number of directors, or for any other reason, shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, regardless of the presence of a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A director so elected by the Board shall hold office only until the next annual election of directors and, except as otherwise required by law, until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also provide that no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

Any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, at any annual meeting of stockholders of the Company or at any special meeting of stockholders of the Company, the notice of which shall state that the removal of a director or directors is among the purposes of the meeting, with the affirmative vote of at least 80 of the vote which all holders of common stock are entitled to cast thereon. 
 
 Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our Bylaws contain provisions requiring advance notice be delivered to the Company of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting and providing for procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our Board of Directors. For business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting (other than a stockholder proposal submitted in accordance with the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), or for stockholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors, a stockholder must give notice no later than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the date of the preceding year s annual meeting (subject to limited exceptions in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date). In the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of election of directors, any director nomination by a stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the special meeting was first mailed or publicly disclosed. In each case, the stockholder s notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws, and the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) must comply with the detailed information and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws. 
 
 Additionally, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company s nominees pursuant to the SEC s universal proxy rule (Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act) must comply with the requirements of the Company s Bylaws, including providing the notice required under Rule 14a-19 within the timeframe specified in the preceding paragraph. Further, if a stockholder provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act that the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of any proposed nominee and subsequently (A) notifies the Company that such stockholder no longer intends to do so or (B) fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) or Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act, the Company shall disregard any proxies solicited for such proposed nominee. Upon request by the Company, any stockholder that has provided such a notice of intention to solicit proxies must deliver to the Secretary of the Company, not later than 5 business days prior to the applicable meeting date, reasonable evidence that the solicitation requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act have been satisfied. 
 
 Special Meetings and Written Consent. A special meeting of the stockholders may only be called by our Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or our President. Stockholders are not permitted to propose business to be brought before a special meeting. In addition, stockholders are not permitted under the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaw s to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 
 
 Scheduling Changes and Conduct of Meetings. Our Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors by a majority-approved resolution may postpone, reschedule or 

cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously called by any of them. Our Bylaws also provide the chair of any meeting of stockholders broad powers convene and (for any and no reason) to recess or adjourn the meeting and to prescribe rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of the meeting and, in addition, to determine and declare that a matter of business was not properly brought before the meeting and, if the chair should so determine, to declare that any such matter of business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that any annual or special meeting of stockholders shall not be held at any place, but shall instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Section 211(a) of the DGCL. 
 
 Business Combinations with Substantial Stockholders Anti-Greenmail Provision. The Certificate of Incorporation contains a fair price provision that requires that mergers, consolidations, certain asset sales, liquidations, certain recapitalizations, and certain other transactions (each, a Business Combination involving the Company and a person or group (each, a Substantial Stockholder that beneficially owns 10 or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or the Company either (1) meet certain minimum price and procedural requirements, (2) be approved by three-fourths of the Continuing Directors (those Directors in office immediately prior to the date such Substantial Stockholder became a Substantial Stockholder and, subject to certain conditions, their successors who are approved by a majority of the then current Continuing Directors), or (3) be approved by the affirmative vote of (a) 90 of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and (b) the number or proportion of shares of any class or series of any class of other shares of the Company (if any) as shall be required by the express terms of such class or series. The fair price provision also provides that it can only be amended by an affirmative vote described in clause (2) or (3) above and such other vote of the stockholders as may be required by statute or the Bylaws. 
 
 To consummate a Business Combination based on the minimum price and procedural requirements, the following conditions must be met 
 
 a. Without the approval of three-fourths of the Continuing Directors, a Substantial Stockholder, after the time it becomes a Substantial Stockholder, shall not have (a) made any material change in the Company s business or capital structure (b) received the benefit of any loan, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance provided by the Company, except proportionately with all other stockholders (c) made, caused or brought about any change in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the membership of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or (d) acquired any newly issued or treasury shares from the Company (except upon conversion of convertible securities or as a result of a pro rata share dividend or share split) and 
 
 a. All of the holders of common stock of the Company must receive consideration that is not less than the greatest of (a) the highest price per share (including brokerage commissions, soliciting dealers fees and all other expenses) paid by the Substantial Stockholder in acquiring any of its shares of common stock of the Company (b) the per share book value of the common stock of the Company at the time the Business Combination is effected, as determined by an independent appraisal firm or other experts selected by the Board of Directors (c) the highest sale or bid price per share of the common stock during the 24 months immediately preceding the time the Business Combination is effected and (d) an amount that bears the same or a greater percentage relationship to the market price of the common stock of the Company immediately prior 

to the announcement of the Business Combination as the highest price paid in 2(a) above bore to the market price of the common stock of the Company immediately prior to the commencement of acquisition of the common stock of the Company by such Substantial Stockholder. 
 
 The Certificate of Incorporation also contains a prevention of greenmail provision that provides, in general, that any purchase or other acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of shares of common stock of the Company known by the Company to be beneficially owned by any holder of 5 or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company that has owned such securities for less than two years requires the affirmative vote of 80 of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, unless such shares are purchased at or below Fair Market Value (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), as part of a tender or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders and in accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or by means of open market purchases if the price and other terms are not negotiated by the purchaser and the seller. The Certificate of Incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of 80 of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to amend, modify or repeal this anti-greenmail provision. 
 
 Forum Selection Provision. The Bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located in the State of Delaware (or, if no state court within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following actions (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company s Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws (as either may be amended from time to time) and (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the Delaware internal affairs doctrine. 
 
 Emergency Bylaws. Our Bylaws provide that, in the event of any emergency, disaster or catastrophe, as referred to in Section 110 of the DGCL or any similar emergency condition (including a pandemic), permit meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors) to be called by any director or by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary of the Company, lower applicable quorum requirements to three directors for any Board meeting and one director for any Board committee meeting, and permit certain Designated Officers (determined by the Board as set forth in the Emergency Bylaws) to be deemed directors for purposes of obtaining a quorum for as long as the emergency is ongoing. 
 
 Amendments of Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. In general, any amendment or restatement of the Certificate of Incorporation is subject to approval by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group of our stockholders entitled to vote thereon, unless the Board of Directors shall require a greater vote. Our Bylaws provide that they may be altered or amended by action of the Board or by vote of our stockholders at an annual or special meeting where notice of such amendment has been duly given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, approval of 80 of the votes entitled to be cast are required to amended certain provisions of the 

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, including matters previously described herein under Voting Rights and Election of Directors, Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations and Special Meetings and Written Consent. 
 
 Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law 
 
 The Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and an interested stockholder (defined, generally, as a person owning 15 or more of a corporation s outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years from the date such person becomes an interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, unless the transaction is approved by the board of directors and the holders of at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation (excluding voting stock held by the interested stockholder), certain business transactions are prohibited, such as a merger with, disposition of assets to, or receipt of disproportionate financial benefits by the interested stockholder, or any other transaction that would increase the interested stockholder s proportionate ownership of any class or series of the corporation s stock. The statutory ban does not apply if, upon consummation of the transaction in which any person becomes an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owns at least 85 of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation (excluding voting stock held by persons who are both directors and officers or by certain employee stock plans) or if the transaction by which the interested stockholder becomes such is approved by the board of directors of the corporation prior to the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.

 (ii) For purposes of any requirement for the Borrowers to compensate Lenders for losses in the Credit Agreement resulting from any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of any Interest Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement), references to the Interest Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall be deemed to include any relevant interest payment date or payment period for a Term SOFR Loan. 
 (c) Interest Rates . The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of Term SOFR or SOFR or with respect to any rate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection of such rate and any related spread or other adjustment) that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Conforming Changes.

 Each Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, each conversion of Loans that are Term SOFR Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Committed Loan Notice provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice. 
 Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11 00 a.m. (Eastern Time) two Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans or of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans provided , however , that if the Borrower wishes to request Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period other than one, three or six months in duration as provided in the definition of Interest Period, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11 00 a.m. four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. In the case of a request for a Borrowing described in the preceding proviso, not later than 11 00 a.m. (Eastern Time), three Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders and the Administrative Agent. Each Borrowing, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of 5,000,000 or a whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice with respect to Term SOFR Loans shall specify (A) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (B) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which 

existing Loans are to be converted, and (E) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. 
 (e) Conforming Changes . With respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes in consultation with the Company from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Company and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 (f) Committed Loan Notice . For purposes of a Borrowing of, or conversion or continuation of or to, Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans based on Term SOFR, the Borrower shall use the form of Committed Loan Notice attached hereto as Appendix B . 
 (g) Interest . 
 (i) Subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement with respect to default interest, each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the sum of Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. 
 (ii) Interest on each Term SOFR Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified the Credit Agreement. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any debtor relief law. 
 (h) Computations . All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest with respect to Term SOFR Loans shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to subject to the provisions in the Credit Agreement addressing payments generally, bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 

(i) Successor Rates . The provisions in the Credit Agreement addressing the replacement of a current Successor Rate for a currency shall be deemed to apply to Term SOFR Loans and Term SOFR, as applicable, and the related defined terms shall be deemed to include Term SOFR.

 The relocation company specializes in helping you locate the right property in the right neighborhood quickly and easily. If you wish support in finding rental accommodation your Personal Move Manager will contact you to review the program and associated benefits and to discuss housing and community needs at the destination location. After this discussion, your Personal Move Manager will use the information acquired to recommend a real estate agent or rental agency to provide assistance and show you available accommodations for up to 2 days during your home finding trip. To assist Harsco in controlling relocation costs, you must allow the relocation company to make the first contact with the real estate agent(s). Only knowledgeable agents with a proven track record of successfully finding homes within the price range you have requested will be recommended. If you have a real estate agent you would like to recommend, it is important that you let your Personal Move Manager know who the agent is and where he she can be reached. Your Personal Move Manager will then contact the agent to obtain his her credentials and, if qualifications are acceptable, will select that agent to assist you in searching for a new home. 
 
 The relocation company s Personal Move Manager will offer the following assistance 
 
 Conduct a telephone briefing with you to perform a needs analysis regarding lifestyle and housing requirements 
 Select a rental assistance company or real estate firm to assist you in identifying rental housing 
 Provide the selected rental assistance company or real estate firm with information regarding your needs

 Counsel you regarding rental considerations, which may include, but are not limited to rental applications, deposits, security considerations, lease considerations (such as build, buy or transfer clauses) and renters insurance. 
 
 In order to avoid any future penalties a transfer clause should be inserted into any lease that you sign at the new location. The following clause is recommended 
 
 In the event the renter is transferred, or decides to purchase or build a home during the term of this lease, this lease may be terminated upon thirty (30) days written notice to landlord with no penalty to renter. Renter will provide a copy of the employer s relocation authorization. 

Accommodation Furniture rental 
 
 Leases, utilities, and related living expenses will be in the executive s name. The relocation company can assist with arranging furniture rental and short-term temporary accommodation, if required which will be funded from the one-time lump sum payment of USD 125,000.

Available options could be a self-move truck, mailboxes through UPS or similar or surface transportation. 
 If you chose to utilize the household goods removal under Section 6 of this policy, you will be responsible for paying the relocation vendor the cost of the shipment directly out of the one-time lump sum NET payment of USD 125,000. Please ensure that you receive a quote for the household goods removal prior to confirming packing dates.

The mover will provide all required packing materials and remove the debris upon completion of the move. Prior to the start of packing, the moving company representative will complete a survey, by phone or in person, of those household goods you will be moving. This survey is used to determine what services, materials and equipment will be required to complete your move.

Special arrangements for shipping antiques or other items of extreme value must be approved in advance and supporting documentation such as insurance appraisals is required for verification. The Company does not cover the costs of appraisals. Special crating expenses must have prior approval. 
 Please check the inventory list prepared by the movers very carefully before you sign the document. You will want to be sure it is accurate and includes all goods intended for shipment. When your goods arrive, you or a responsible family member must be present to check off every item brought into your home. If you discover any damage to your goods, set the damaged goods and container aside and immediately notify your Personal Move Manager for instructions on how to file a claim. The moving company will provide you with the proper claim forms and procedures. 
 
 Excluded Items, Services and Costs 
 Movement of the following items are NOT covered by the Company aerosol products or flammable materials, items requiring excessive or special van accommodations, boats (14 feet in length or longer), canoes trailers, farm equipment, firewood, logs, patio blocks or other construction materials, frozen foods or other perishables, jewelry, furs, firearms, high value collection, currency or art, liquors or carbonated beverages, money, personal papers, records, tickets, securities or legal documents, pets or livestock, plants, stamps, coins or other valuable collections, tractors over 25 (hp), trailers, campers, motorcycles, jet skis, snowmobiles or recreational vehicles, yard items that are large and require additional labor for dismantling and re-assembly (i.e. swimming pools, spas, storage sheds, satellite antennas, swing sets, etc.)

 SECTION 7 Tax Liability Assistance 
 Most reimbursements made to or on your behalf that are directly related to relocation are considered taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that all reimbursements made by the Company are considered compensation for services . You must report all relocation reimbursements on your federal income tax return. 
 
 Tax Gross-up 
 Unless otherwise indicated in this policy, the Company will pay the estimated federal (at the supplemental tax rate only), state, local, FICA, and Medicare tax liability (gross-up) that arises from the taxable but generally not deductible portion of Company-reimbursed expenses associated with a Company-requested relocation. The estimated tax liability (including tax-on-tax, or full gross-up) will take into consideration your marital status, number of dependents, and only your Company earned income (annual salary). 
 The amount of tax gross-up will be remitted by the Company directly to the appropriate revenue agency and reported as withheld taxes on your W-2 Wage and Tax Statement. 
 The determination of whether an item is or is not deductible by you on your individual income tax return is a personal decision you must make. The way that an item is treated by the Company for purposes of income tax withholding does not constitute tax advice.

 Exhibit 10(bc) 

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is made as of the ____ day of _______ 2023, by and between Harsco Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Corporation ), and the individual whose name appears on the signature page hereof (such individual being referred to herein as the Indemnified Representative and, together with other persons who may execute similar agreements, as Indemnified Representatives ). 
 WHEREAS, the Indemnified Representative currently is and will be in the future serving in one or more capacities as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee, agent fiduciary, or trustee of, or in a similar capacity for, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other entity, and in so doing is and will be performing a valuable service to or on behalf of the Corporation 
 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Corporation will utilize commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Corporation and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and wide-spread practice among United States-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Corporation believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Corporation or business enterprise itself 
 WHEREAS, the Indemnified Representative is willing to continue to serve and to undertake additional duties and responsibilities for and on behalf of the Corporation on the condition that he be indemnified contractually by the Corporation and 
 WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Indemnified Representative to continue to serve the Corporation, and in consideration for such continued service, the Corporation has agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Representative upon the terms set forth herein. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Corporation and the Indemnified Representative agree as follows 
 1. Agreement To Serve . The Indemnified Representative agrees to serve or continue to serve for or on behalf of the Corporation in each Official Capacity (as hereinafter defined) held now or in the future for so long as the Indemnified Representative is duly elected or 

appointed or until such time as the Indemnified Representative tenders a resignation in writing. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries and any Indemnified Representative who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The Indemnified Representative specifically acknowledges that the Indemnified Representative's employment with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, if any, is at will, and that the Indemnified Representative may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided in any written employment contract between the Indemnified Representative and the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, other applicable formal severance policies duly adopted by the board of directors of the Indemnified Representative's employer, or, with respect to service as a Director of the Corporation, by the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after the Indemnified Representative has ceased to serve in any Official Capacity for or on behalf of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. 
 2. Indemnification . 
 (a) Except as provided in Sections 3 and 5 hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnified Representative against any Liability (as hereinafter defined) incurred by or assessed against the Indemnified Representative in connection with any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) in which the Indemnified Representative may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Representative is or was serving in any Official Capacity held now or in the future, including, without limitation, any Liability resulting from actual or alleged breach or neglect of duty, error, misstatement, misleading statement, omission, negligence, act giving rise to strict or product liability, act giving rise to liability for environmental contamination, or other act or omission, whether occurring prior to or after the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement 
 (i) Liability means any damage, judgment, amount paid in settlement, fine, penalty, punitive damage, or expense of any nature (including attorneys' fees and expenses) 
 (ii) Proceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, appeal, arbitration, or other proceeding of any nature, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, whether formal or informal, and whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation, a class of its security holders, or any other party and 
 (iii) Official Capacity means service to the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent or, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary, or trustee of, or in a similar capacity for, another corporation, partnership, joint 

venture, trust, employee benefit plan (including a plan qualified under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), or other entity. 
 (b) Notwithstanding Section 2(a) hereof, except for a Proceeding brought pursuant to Section 5(d) of this Agreement, the Corporation shall not indemnify the Indemnified Representative under this Agreement for any Liability incurred in a Proceeding initiated by the Indemnified Representative unless the Proceeding is authorized, either before or after commencement of the Proceeding, by the majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. An affirmative defense or counterclaim of an Indemnified Representative shall not be deemed to constitute a Proceeding initiated by the Indemnified Representative. 
 3. Exclusions . 
 (a) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Liability incurred by the Indemnified Representative 
 (i) to the extent payment for such Liability is made to the Indemnified Representative under an insurance policy obtained by the Corporation 
 (ii) to the extent payment is made to the Indemnified Representative for such Liability by the Corporation under its Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise than pursuant to this Agreement 
 (iii) to the extent such Liability is determined in a final determination pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof to be based upon or attributable to the Indemnified Representative gaining any personal profit to which such Indemnified Representative was not legally entitled 
 (iv) for any claim by or on behalf of the Corporation for recovery of profits resulting from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase by such Indemnified Representative of equity securities of the Corporation pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended 
 (v) for which the conduct of the Indemnified Representative has been determined in a final determination pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof to constitute bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty, in either such case material to the cause of action or claim at issue in the Proceeding or 
 (vi) to the extent such indemnification has been determined in a final determination pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof to be unlawful. 
 (b) Any act, omission, liability, knowledge, or other fact of or relating to any other person, including any other person who is also an Indemnified Representative, shall not be imputed to the Indemnified Representative for the purposes of determining the applicability of any exclusion set forth herein. 

(c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified Representative is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. 
 4. Advancement of Expenses . The Corporation shall pay any Liability in the nature of an expense (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in good faith by the Indemnified Representative in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand for payment by the Indemnified Representative provided, however, that the Indemnified Representative shall repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined, pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof, that the Indemnified Representative is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement. The financial ability of the Indemnified Representative to repay an advance shall not be a prerequisite to the making of such advance. 
 5. Indemnification Procedure . 
 (a) The Indemnified Representative shall use his best efforts to notify promptly the Secretary of the Corporation of the commencement of any Proceeding or the occurrence of any event which might give rise to a Liability under this Agreement, but the failure to so notify the Corporation shall not relieve the Corporation of any obligation which it may have to the Indemnified Representative under this Agreement or otherwise. 
 (b) The Corporation shall be entitled, upon notice to the Indemnified Representative, to assume the defense of any Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Representative involved in such Proceeding or, if there be more than one (1) Indemnified Representative involved in such Proceeding, to a majority of the Indemnified Representatives involved in such Proceeding. If, in accordance with the foregoing, the Corporation defends the Proceeding, the Corporation shall not be liable for the expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) of the Indemnified Representative incurred in connection with the defense of such Proceeding subsequent to the required notice, unless (i) such expenses (including attorneys' fees) have been authorized by the Corporation or (ii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Representative, or to the majority of Indemnified Representatives if more than one (1) is involved, to assume the defense of such Proceeding. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Indemnified Representative may elect to retain counsel at the Indemnified Representative's own cost and expense to participate in the defense of such Proceeding. 
 (c) The Corporation shall not be required to obtain the consent of the Indemnified Representative to the settlement of any Proceeding which the Corporation has undertaken to defend if the Corporation assumes full and sole responsibility for such settlement and the settlement grants the Indemnified Representative a complete and unqualified release in 

respect of the potential Liability. The Corporation shall not be liable for any amount paid by an Indemnified Representative in settlement of any Proceeding that is not defended by the Corporation, unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
 (d) Except as set forth herein, any dispute concerning the right to indemnification under this Agreement and any other dispute arising hereunder, including but not limited to matters of validity, interpretation, application, and enforcement, shall be determined exclusively by and through final and binding arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, each party hereto expressly and conclusively waiving its or his right to proceed to a judicial determination with respect to such matter provided, however, that in the event that a claim for indemnification against liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act (other than the payment by the Corporation of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Corporation in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by a director, officer, or controlling person in connection with securities being registered under the Act, the Corporation will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of competent jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association before a panel of three (3) arbitrators, the first of whom shall be selected by the Corporation, the second of whom shall be selected by the Indemnified Representative, and the third of whom shall be selected by the other two (2) arbitrators. If for any reason arbitration under the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association cannot be initiated, the necessary arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by the presiding judge of the state court of general jurisdiction in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. Each arbitrator selected as provided herein is required to be serving or to have served as a director or an executive officer of a corporation whose shares of common stock, during at least one year of such service, were quoted in the NASDAQ National Market System or listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange. The Corporation shall reimburse the Indemnified Representative for the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in prosecuting or defending such arbitration to the full extent of such expenses if the Indemnified Representative is awarded 50 or more of the monetary value of his claim or, if not, to the extent such expenses are determined by the arbitrators to be allocable to the Corporation. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that a party may compel arbitration pursuant to this Section 5(d) through an action for specific performance and that any award entered by the arbitrators may be enforced, without further evidence or proceedings, in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

(e) Upon payment under this Agreement to the Indemnified Representative with respect to any Liability, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of the Indemnified Representative to recover against any person with respect to such Liability, and the Indemnified Representative shall execute all documents and instruments required and shall take such other actions as may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be necessary for the Corporation to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
 6. Contribution . If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable for any reason to hold harmless an Indemnified Representative in respect of any Liability or portion thereof, the Corporation shall contribute to such Liability or portion thereof in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Corporation and the Indemnified Representative from the transaction giving rise to the Liability. 
 7. Non-Exclusivity . The rights granted to the Indemnified Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnified Representative may be entitled under statute, the provisions of any certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or agreement, a vote of stockholders or directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an Official Capacity and in any other capacity. 
 8. Reliance on Provisions . The Indemnified Representative shall be deemed to be acting in any Official Capacity in reliance upon the rights of indemnification provided by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation and the Indemnified Representative acknowledge the existence of Article III, Section 9 of the Corporation's By-Laws as restated and adopted by the Board of Directors on October 19, 2022, effective immediately, and confirm that the Indemnified Representative is also acting in reliance thereon. 
 9. Severability and Reformation . Any provision of this Agreement which is determined to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or under any circumstance shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to the applicable law of such jurisdiction and still give maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto. Any such determination shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining provisions hereof and shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction or under any other circumstances. 
 10. Notices . Any notice, claim, request, or demand required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or sent by telegram or by registered or certified mail, first class, postage prepaid (i) if to the Corporation, to Harsco Corporation, 100 N. 18 th Street, Suite 1700, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, Attention Corporate Secretary, or (ii) if to any Indemnified Representative, to the address of such 

Indemnified Representative listed on the signature page hereof, or to such other address as any party hereto shall have specified in a notice duly given in accordance with this Section 10. 
 11. Amendments Binding Effect . No amendment, modification, termination, or cancellation of this Agreement shall be effective as to the Indemnified Representative unless signed in writing by the Corporation and the Indemnified Representative. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Representative's heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. 
 12. Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first set forth above.
