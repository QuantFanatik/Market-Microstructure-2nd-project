 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 of Boston Properties, Inc. and Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to BXP mean Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation and real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to BPLP and the Operating Partnership mean Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of BPLP. As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has exclusive control of BPLP s day-to-day management. Therefore, unless stated otherwise or the context requires, references to the Company, we, us and our mean collectively BXP, BPLP and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by BXP. 
 As of December 31, 2022, BXP owned an approximate ownership interest in BPLP. The remaining approximate 10.4 interest was owned by limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP (1) contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units or preferred units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or (2) received long-term incentive plan units of BPLP pursuant to BXP s Stock Option and Incentive Plans, or both. Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a common unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of BXP s common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by BPLP, however, BXP may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of BXP common stock in exchange for the common units. If BXP so elects, its common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. BXP generally expects that it will elect to issue its common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, BXP s percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever BXP issues shares of its common stock other than to acquire common units of BPLP, BXP must contribute any net proceeds it receives to BPLP and BPLP must issue to BXP an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. 
 The Company believes that combining the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of BXP and BPLP into this single report: 
 enhances investors understanding of BXP and BPLP by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both BXP and BPLP; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between BXP and BPLP in the context of how BXP and BPLP operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of BPLP are consolidated into the financial statements of BXP. BXP does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in BPLP, nor does it have employees of its own. BPLP, not BXP, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of BXP. BPLP holds substantially all of the assets of BXP, including ownership interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures. BPLP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by BXP, which are contributed to the capital of BPLP in exchange for common or preferred units of partnership in BPLP, as applicable, BPLP generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and interests in joint ventures. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP. The limited partners of BPLP are accounted for as partners capital in BPLP s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in BPLP s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements include the same 

Table of Contents 

 noncontrolling interests in BPLP and limited partners of BPLP. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued by each of BXP and BPLP. 
 In addition, the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP differ in total real estate assets resulting from previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets of BXP at the time of such redemptions, resulting in a difference between the net real estate of BXP as compared to BPLP of approximately 249.9 million, or 1.3 at December 31, 2022, and a corresponding difference in depreciation expense, impairment losses and gains on sales of real estate upon the sale of these properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up. The acquisition accounting was nullified on a prospective basis beginning in 2009 as a result of the Company s adoption of a new accounting standard requiring any subsequent redemptions to be accounted for solely as an equity transaction. 
 To help investors better understand the key differences between BXP and BPLP, the following items in this report present information separately for BXP and BPLP: 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities;

 Summary of Risk Factors 
 The risk factors detailed in Item 1A titled Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. The following is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A: 
 Our performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. 
 Enhanced market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions. 
 The outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and those of our clients. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry, including, without limitation: 
 potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space; 
 potential adverse effects from major clients bankruptcies or insolvencies; 
 potential sustained changes in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 potential delays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; and 
 potential increases in costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation. 
 Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs. 
 Our use of joint ventures and participation in the Strategic Capital Program SCP may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire. 
 We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. 
 Increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to re-finance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all. 
 Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities. 
 We face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change. 
 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. 
 Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems.

Table of Contents 

 Our involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We face risks associated with BXP s status as a real estate investment trust (REIT), including, without limitation: 
 failure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends; 
 possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws could result in increased tax costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders; and 
 in order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 
 Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our clients. 
 This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 58 .

 PART I 

Item 1 . Business 

General 
 BXP, a Delaware corporation, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, and is one of the largest publicly-traded office REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2022) in the United States that develops, owns and manages primarily premier workplaces. BXP was formed in 1997 to succeed the real estate development, redevelopment, acquisition, management, operating and leasing businesses associated with the predecessor company founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in 1970. 
 Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. At December 31, 2022, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 194 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 54.1 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including 13 properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2022, our properties consisted of: 
 173 office and life sciences properties (including 10 properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 14 retail properties (including two properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 six residential properties (including one property under construction); and 
 one hotel. 
 We consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings and are professionally managed and maintained. As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates. Our definition of premier workplaces may be different than those used by other companies. 
 We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services. For this reason, we refer to our tenants as clients due to the many facets of our continuous engagements with them, which span beyond the usual tenant/landlord relationship. Throughout this Annual Report, we use the terms tenant and client interchangeably. 
 BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner. Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 2800 28th Street, Suite 170, Santa Monica, California 90405, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111, 1001 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98154 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037. 
 Our internet address is http://www.bxp.com. On our website, you can obtain free copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. You may also obtain BXP s and BPLP s reports by accessing the EDGAR database at the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov, or we will furnish an electronic or paper copy of these reports free of charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, Boston Properties, Inc., Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199. Boston Properties is a registered trademark, BXP is a registered trademark, and the bxp logo is a registered trademark, in both cases, owned by BPLP. 
 Boston Properties Limited Partnership 
 BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February 21, 2023, the owner of approximately 89.4 of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP and (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP LTIP Units ), for which all performance conditions have been satisfied for such conversion. We exclude from (1) and (2) above other LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards in

Table of Contents 

 2021 or later MYLTIP Awards ), which remain subject to performance conditions. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. 
 
 Transactions During 2022 
 Acquisitions 
 On May 17, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Madison Centre in Seattle, Washington for a net purchase price, including transaction costs, of approximately 724.3 million. The acquisition was completed using the proceeds from BPLP s 730.0 million unsecured term loan (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Madison Centre is an approximately 755,000 net rentable square foot, 37-story, LEED-Platinum certified, premier workplace. 
 On September 16, 2022, we acquired 125 Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts for a net purchase price, including transaction costs, of approximately 592.4 million. The acquisition was completed with available cash and borrowings under BPLP s unsecured credit facility. 125 Broadway is a 271,000 net rentable square foot, six-story, laboratory/life sciences property. 
 Dispositions 
 For information explaining why BXP and BPLP may report different gains on sales of real estate, see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 On March 31, 2022, we completed the sale of 195 West Street located in Waltham, Massachusetts for a gross sale price of 37.7 million.

 On June 15, 2022, we completed the sale of our suburban Virginia 95 Office Park properties located in Springfield, Virginia for an aggregate gross sale price of 127.5 million.

 Developments/Redevelopments 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 13 properties under construction/redevelopment, which we expect will total approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet. We estimate our share of the total investment to complete these projects, in the aggregate, is approximately 1.9 billion, of which approximately 729.1 million remains to be invested as of December 31, 2022.

 Business and Growth Strategies 
 Business Strategies 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are: 
 to target a few carefully selected dynamic gateway markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective clients in various industries and where clients have demonstrated a preference for premier workplaces and other facilities. Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. We have explored, and may continue to explore for future investment, select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits; 
 to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office and life sciences space, as well as selected retail and residential space; 
 to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue; 
 to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today s clients who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, including those amenities that enrich in-person experiences and support a hybrid work environment, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; 
 to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing; 
 to explore joint venture opportunities with (1) existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital and (2) expand our SCP, leveraging our skills as developers, owners and managers of premier workplaces and mixed-use complexes; 
 to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential; 
 to seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and 
 to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. 
 Growth Strategies 
 External Growth Strategies 
 We believe that our development experience, our organizational depth, utilization of our SCP and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of premier workplaces, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and life sciences space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include: 
 9 

Table of Contents 

 our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support approximately 16.9 million additional square feet of new development (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); 
 our reputation gained through 53 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties; 
 our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services; 
 our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry; 
 our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas; 
 our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; 
 our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets; 
 our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and 
 our relationship with domestic and foreign investors, including SCP partners, who seek to partner with companies like ours. 
 Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories: 
 Development in selected submarkets. We believe the selected development of well-positioned premier workplaces, including office, life sciences, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 53-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential. 
 In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment. 
 Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 
 Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals. We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP s common stock may facilitate these types 
 10

 of acquisitions on a tax-efficient basis. Existing promulgated Treasury regulations may limit the tax benefits previously available to sellers in some variations of these transactions. 
 Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. 
 Internal Growth Strategies 
 We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage clients to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing clients through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing clients with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to: 
 Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit clients. In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors. 
 The weighted-average lease term of our in-place leases based on square feet, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.9 years at December 31, 2022, and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable clients. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2022, leases with respect to approximately 5.1 of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2023. 
 Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for client retention. We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to client needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in client relations. In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our clients. 
 Replace clients quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new clients and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to clients, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets. 
 Extend terms of existing leases to existing clients prior to expiration . We have also successfully structured early client renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy clients on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships. 
 Re-development of existing assets. We believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building s size, improve building systems, including conversion to higher yielding life sciences uses, and sustainability features, and/or add client amenities, thereby increasing client demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company. In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for

 increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location. Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
 Our Strategy 
 We actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our six regions. The BXP ESG strategy is to conduct our business, the development, ownership and operation of new and existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive economic, social and environmental outcomes for our clients, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy of long-term ownership and our commitment to our communities and the centers of commerce and civic life that make them thrive. We are focused on developing and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, greenhouse gas GHG emissions and climate change. Positive social impact is also of great importance to BXP and our employees, which is exhibited by our commitments to charitable giving, volunteerism, public realm investments and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and our communities. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and broader society while mutually benefiting our stakeholders.

 We continue to address the needs of our stakeholders by making efforts to maintain and improve our ESG performance across three pillars: climate action, climate resilience and social good. BXP is a widely recognized industry leader in ESG. 2022 ESG highlights include: 
 BXP ranked among the top real estate companies in the GRESB assessment, earning a seventh consecutive 5-Star rating. 2022 was the eleventh consecutive year that BXP earned the GRESB Green Star designation 
 BXP s MSCI rating improved from an A to AA, and CDP score improved from C to B 
 BXP was named to Newsweek s List of America s Most Responsible Companies in 2023 for the third consecutive year. BXP ranked first in the Real Estate Housing industry with an increased ranking of 29th overall out of the 500 companies and received the third highest environmental score 
 BXP was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America for the second consecutive year. BXP was one of eight real estate companies that qualified and the only office REIT in the index, scoring in the 95th percentile of the real estate companies assessed for inclusion 
 BXP was recognized by Commercial Property Executive for having the Best ESG Program 
 BXP was the recipient of Nareit s prestigious Leader in the Light Award 
 BXP was named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award Winner 
 BXP was recognized as an inaugural Platinum Level Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy 
 Our leadership position is due, in part, to our establishment of environmental goals, the periodic reporting of progress towards our goals and the achievement of these goals. We have publicly adopted energy, emissions, water and waste goals that establish reduction targets aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As of the end of 2021, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41 decrease in energy use intensity and over 70 reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year. We have also aligned our emissions reduction targets with climate science and in 2020 became the first North American office REIT to establish an emissions reduction target ambition in line with a 1.5 C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission under the Science Based Targets initiative. In April 2021, we affirmed our commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations (for direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.

 We are focused on developing, owning and operating healthy and high-performance buildings. BXP is a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council USGBC and has a long history of green buildings under USGBC s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED rating system. As of December 31, 2022, we have LEED-certified 33.5 million square feet of our total in-service portfolio, of which 94 is certified at the highest Gold and Platinum levels. In 2018, we announced a partnership with a leading healthy building certification system, Fitwel, to support healthy building design and operational practices across our portfolio, becoming a Fitwel Champion. We completed our Fitwel Champion commitments and have added 23.8 million square feet of Fitwel certified buildings across our total in-service portfolio since 2018. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed the Fitwel Viral Response Module Enterprise and Asset-level Certification at all actively managed buildings. 
 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB Disclosures 
 The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposed sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area Energy Intensity percentage of the eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR ENERGY STAR certified total energy consumed by portfolio area Total Energy Consumption water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area Water Intensity and total water withdrawn by portfolio area Total Water Consumption ). Our energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by an independent, third party assurance expert, which includes all SASB 2021 energy and water metrics. For more information on the independent, third-party assurance expert and the methodology used to assure the data, refer to Reporting below. During the 2021 calendar year, 46 buildings representing 43 of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified. A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications. 
 The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2021 for which data were available on occupied and actively managed buildings where we had operational control. 1,2,3,4,5,6 
 
 _______________ 
 (1) Full 2022 calendar year energy and water data will not be available and assured by a third party until March 31, 2023. Therefore, 2021 is the most recent year for which complete and third-party assured energy and water data is available. 
 (2) The charts reflect the performance of our occupied and actively managed portfolio in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. We define occupied buildings as those with no more than 50 vacancy. Actively managed buildings are those where we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions. At the end of the 2021 calendar year, our occupied and actively managed portfolio included 116 buildings totaling 44.8 million gross square feet, which accounted for approximately 85 of BXP s total in-service portfolio by area. 
 (3) Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when we obtain energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the calendar year, regardless of when such data was obtained.

 Climate Resilience 
 As a long-term owner and active manager of real estate assets in operation and under development, we take a long-term view on climate change risks and opportunities. We are focused on understanding how climate change may impact the performance of our portfolio and the steps we can take to increase climate resilience. We continue to evaluate the potential risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio and are taking proactive steps to plan for and/or mitigate such risks. 
 Governance 
 As a vertically integrated, full-service real estate company, we are engaged in addressing climate-related issues at all levels of our organization. Management s role in overseeing, assessing and managing climate-related risks, opportunities and initiatives is spread across multiple teams throughout our organization, including our Board of Directors, executive leadership and our Sustainability, Risk Management, Development, Construction and Property Management Departments. BXP has a dedicated team of sustainability professionals focused on ESG issues that coordinate and collaborate across corporate and regional teams to advance environmental sustainability issues and initiatives. Our Board of Directors has established a board-level Sustainability Committee to, among other things, increase Board oversight over environmental and sustainability issues, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board delegated to the Sustainability Committee its responsibility to oversee BXP s sustainability program, which includes monitoring and addressing, as needed, environmental-, sustainability- and climate-related risks. 
 Our approach to climate-related issues is also informed by robust stakeholder engagement. We are in frequent dialogue with investors, customers, community members, governmental policymakers, consultants and other non-governmental organizations. We are heavily involved in industry associations and participate in conferences and workshops covering ESG, sustainability and climate resilience topics. Through these engagements, we enhance our knowledge of climate-related issues and those issues that are most important to our stakeholders and industry best practices. 
 
 Strategy 
 We have aligned our climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TCFD ). The TCFD framework has informed the development of our strategy for identifying and managing both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. As defined by the TCFD framework, physical risks associated with climate change include acute risks (extreme weather-related events) and chronic risks (such as extreme heat and sea-level rise), and transition risks associated with climate change include policy and legal risks, and other technology, market and reputation-related risks. 
 We continue to proactively assess the potential risks that may impact the properties in our portfolio, gather information and monitor the evolving regulatory landscape related to climate change. Our process for assessing climate-related risks and their implications on our properties and business includes a climate change scenario analyses that was conducted in 2021 on our portfolio assets. In particular, we engaged Moody s ESG Solutions (formerly branded as Four Twenty Seven Application), an independent provider of science-driven insights and analytics on climate risk, for its climate risk scoring to evaluate the forward-looking physical climate risk exposure of our entire portfolio. The scenario analysis and physical risk scoring was based on an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, which is a worst-case, high emissions scenario, under a time horizon up to 2040. The scenario analysis included all in-service assets owned by BXP and included climate events such as hurricane, wildfire, heat, water stress, flooding and sea-level rise. We are also using Moody s ESG Solutions data to identify potential risks during the new acquisition diligence process. The analysis of our portfolio yielded no material findings. 
 We consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the context of the following time horizons: short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-10 years) and long-term (>10 years). Based on the foregoing process for evaluating climate-related risks, including the scenario analysis, we have identified (1) the following potential physical and transition risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio in the future across the stated time horizons and (2) our climate-related opportunities. We will continue to analyze the results of the Moody s ESG Solutions analysis and the following risks and opportunities to understand our potential

 exposure and inform our climate resilience strategy and future investments, which include climate-related risk mitigation and initiatives. 
 Time Period Physical Risks Short- to Medium-Term Increased severity of extreme weather events, including flooding and wind damage, extreme heat and sea-level rise may cause one or more of the following to occur: 
 Direct damage to properties 
 Increased costs of property insurance 
 Supply chain disruption 
 Costs associated with capital expenditures and infrastructure-related remediation projects 
 Alteration of designs at new and existing buildings 
 Increased costs of real estate taxes or other assessments 
 
 Long-Term Building adaptation, including architectural and mechanical improvements, could increase capital expenditure requirements. 
 Extreme drought and wildfires could adversely impact demand in markets prone to water scarcity and annual wildfire risk. 
 Sea-level rise and extreme weather events could make property insurance unavailable in high-risk areas. 
 Public transportation system disruptions could impact access to BXP buildings. 
 Chronic climate-related physical risks and associated downtime could result in declining demand for office space at impacted buildings. 
 Time Period Transition Risks Short- to Medium-Term Non-compliance with regulatory requirements, including energy and carbon performance standards, may increase costs and/or introduce potential fines. 
 Compliance with green building codes, including electrification of heating systems, may increase development and operational costs. 
 Failure to meet sustainability needs (e.g., net-zero requirements) of clients and investors could result in lost business. 
 Additional growth, particularly in life sciences, may increase energy and emissions intensities. 
 Long-Term Real estate taxes may increase to fund public projects to improve regional and neighborhood-scale resilience. Time Period Mitigation Other Opportunities Short-Term Energy and carbon reductions could result in greater product differentiation and competitive advantage. 
 Stronger ESG disclosures, particularly regarding climate action and resilience, may qualify BXP for greater inclusion in ESG ETFs and other funds. 
 BXP may benefit from a lower cost of capital from green bonds and/or sustainability-linked credit. 
 BXP may avoid operating cost increases from rising energy costs through actions focused on efficient operations. 
 Medium-Term BXP may avoid penalties associated with building energy and carbon performance standards. 
 Assets may be converted and/or certified net-zero, which may increase demand for office space. 
 Long-Term By focusing on the risks of climate change associated with acute and chronic physical risks during the development, acquisition and operating life of assets, BXP may mitigate losses and downtime resulting from extreme weather events.

 Risk Management 
 BXP is committed to managing and avoiding the impacts of climate change. Our risk management program includes physical and transition risks, including both climate mitigation (resource efficiency and emissions reduction) and adaptation (integration of climate resilience into our investment decision-making). We are actively acquiring, developing and operating a geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate properties. Individual assets have unique risk profiles and insurance requirements. Through the processes of acquisition, development and operation of our in-service portfolio, our experienced real estate professionals are identifying risks, including business continuity risks, loss exposure related to extreme weather events and impacts of regulation, including permitting requirements, codes, and energy and carbon performance standards. The climate risk profile of each individual property is largely dependent on the property s unique attributes, physical location and jurisdictional regulatory requirements. 
 Asset-Level Risk Management 
 We carry all-risk property insurance on our properties including those under development. Insurance coverage mitigates the impact to BXP from losses associated with natural catastrophes, such as floods, fires, earthquakes and wind events. 
 We are preparing for long-term climate risk by considering climate change scenarios and expect that we will continue to assess climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential future climate scenarios and sea-level rise. We will continue to evaluate existing plans and procedures and proactively implement practical, cost-effective resiliency measures and infrastructure enhancements, including: 
 Business Continuity Plans 
 Emergency Response and Life Safety Plans 
 Emergency Evacuation Planning, Procedures and Drills 
 Client Engagement and Coordination 
 Life Safety Analysis 
 Elevation of vault, switchgear and critical equipment during new development 
 Waterproofing of subgrade infrastructure 
 Floodable first floors 
 Temporary flood barriers 
 Backup generation, emergency lighting and fire pumps 
 Onsite energy resources and distributed generation, storage and solar photovoltaic systems. 
 We are managing transition risks by benchmarking energy, carbon, water and waste performance at the asset level and are prioritizing interventions at underperforming assets. We develop, operate and maintain a large portfolio of buildings that are LEED, ENERGY STAR and/or Fitwel certified. As of December 31, 2022, 85 of our actively managed portfolio was certified under one or more of these frameworks. As a leader in green building, we will continue to make investments in building performance, energy efficiency and decarbonization. 
 Through our climate action efforts, we believe we can play a leading role in advancing the transition to a low-carbon economy and are taking action to decarbonize operations. GHG sources include the generated electricity and steam at offsite generation facilities, the onsite combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas), and emissions associated with other business activities, including business travel and new development. We continue to explore and implement creative and cost-effective measures that reduce GHG emissions from our operations. 
 BXP became a proud signatory of the We Are Still In pledge after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and has aligned emissions reduction targets with climate science. The SBTi Target Validation Team has classified BXP s emissions reduction target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5 C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission. We are committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations, or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, which includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emission, by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.

 BXP s Carbon-Neutral Operations Strategy 
 Our strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations includes the following goals: 
 (1) Energy Efficient Operations Approximately 1/3 of total carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2008 base year) from energy conservation and efficient operations. 
 (2) Renewable Energy Advancement of onsite development of renewable energy systems and sourcing offsite renewable energy to meet 100 of our electricity needs by 2025. 
 (3) Electrification Explore and advance electrification, prioritizing electrification of new developments and replacement of onsite gas-fired systems at existing buildings at the end of their useful lives. 
 (4) Carbon Offsets To the extent necessary, offset any remaining emissions during the transition to carbon-free energy. 
 The resilience of our markets may depend on the action taken by cities to adapt transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure for extreme heat, weather events, sea-level rise and flooding. We will continue to encourage the adaptation of our cities and management of physical and transition risks by maintaining a voice in policy decision-making at the local level through direct engagement and/or advocacy through collective membership-based groups. 
 
 Metrics 
 We closely monitor energy consumption and associated GHG emissions and provide detailed accounting of ESG key performance indicators in our annual ESG reporting. As of the end of 2021, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41 decrease in energy use intensity and an over 70 reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year. BXP s carbon-neutral commitment includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our actively managed portfolio where we have operational control. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions include emissions associated with total landlord-controlled energy use. Scope 1 emissions include all emissions associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels for heating, hot water and standby generators. Scope 2 emissions include all emissions associated with the offsite generation of electricity and steam. As our business continues to grow, carbon reduction targets and the transparent disclosure of ESG metrics will remain a priority. 
 
 Reporting 
 A notable part of our commitment to sustainable development and operations is our commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators, as we recognize the importance of this information to investors, lenders and others in understanding how BXP assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities. We publish an annual ESG report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the SASB Framework. BXP s ESG Report includes our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons, and achievements. The report is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. Our annual ESG reports, including all of our energy, water and emissions metrics included therein, are assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert. The assurance expert performs an independent verification for certain of our ESG performance indicators and issues an opinion, which is attached to each ESG report, that opines on each ESG report s inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context, completeness, and reliability. 
 We have been an active participant in the green bond market since 2018, which provides access to sustainability-focused investors interested in the positive environmental externalities of our business activities. Since 2018, BPLP has issued an aggregate of 4.3 billion of green bonds in five separate offerings. The terms of the green bonds have restrictions that limit our allocation of the net proceeds to eligible green projects. We publish Green Bond Allocation Reports disclosing the full or partial allocation, as applicable, of net proceeds from the green bond offerings to eligible green projects. We have published four Green Bond Allocation Reports that fully allocate more than 3.5 billion in net proceeds to eligible green projects. The Green Bond Allocation Reports are available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. We expect to publish a Green Bond Allocation Report to allocate net proceeds from our most recent November 2022 green bond offering in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 Human Capital Management 
 Our culture supports and nurtures our employees. Our employees are a significant distinguishing factor that sets BXP apart. As of December 31, 2022, we had 675 non-union employees (we had 780 employees, inclusive of union employees). All data provided in this Human Capital Management section refers to BXP s non-union employee workforce as the unions control primary aspects of the hiring process. Our operational and financial performance depends on their talents, energy, experience and well-being. Our ability to attract and retain talented people depends on a number of factors, including work environment, career development and professional training, compensation and benefits, and the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We have an established reputation for excellence and integrity and these core values are inherent in our culture and play a critical role in achieving our goals and overall success. 
 Diversity, Equity Inclusion 
 We strive to create a diverse and inclusive workplace. It has been, and will continue to be, our policy to recruit, hire, assign, promote and train in all job titles without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations. By implementing this policy, we aim to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to make their maximum contribution to us and to their own career goals. 
 BXP s Diversity, Equity Inclusion Council (the DEI Council is an executive-sponsored, voluntary and employee-led committee unified by BXP s mission to promote diversity, equity, inclusion and transparency as part of our organization s culture, decision-making practices and business activities, while also providing a mechanism for positive impact in the communities in which we operate. Since its formation in 2020, the DEI Council has grown to over 33 Council members across our six regions, and each member contributes to the overall mission through leadership in one or more of the DEI Council s three committees the Recruiting Development Committee, the Company Policies Committee and the Community Outreach Committee and/or three employee resource groups ERGs ).

 Culture Employee Engagement 
 We believe that the success of our business is tied to the quality of our workforce, and we strive to maintain a corporate environment without losing the entrepreneurial spirit with which we were founded more than 50 years ago. By providing a quality workplace and comprehensive benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our employees to bring their talent, energy, and experience to us. Our continued success is attributable to our employees expertise and dedication. 
 We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to monitor our employees satisfaction in different aspects of their employment, including company performance, leadership, communication, career development and benefits offerings. Past employee responsiveness to the engagement surveys has been consistently high and the results help inform us on matters that our employees view as key contributors to a positive work experience. Based on the most recent employee engagement survey conducted in 2022, with 96 responsiveness, the overall company-wide result was a favorable rating. The highest scoring statement on the survey with a 94 favorability score was BXP conducts its business in accordance with the highest standards and ethical conduct. We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee engagement as needed on a meaningful basis. 
 Another indicator of the success of our efforts in the workplace is the long tenure of our employees, 35 of whom have worked at BXP for ten or more years. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9.42 years and that of our officers is 17.65 years. In 2022, our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 15 . 
 Career Development Training 
 We invest significant resources in our employees personal and professional growth and development and provide a wide range of tools and development opportunities that build and strengthen employees leadership and 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 professional skills. These development opportunities include in-person and virtual training sessions, in-house learning opportunities, various management trainings, departmental conferences, executive townhalls and external programs. We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion and strive for a best-in-class candidate experience for our internal applicants. Open positions are posted, and employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion within the organization. For 2022, 16 of our employees were promoted to elevated roles within our organization. Of the employees promoted, 50 were women and 29 were non-White. 
 Compensation Benefits 
 We designed our compensation program with the goal of providing a balanced and effective way of ensuring internal equity and market competitiveness in our pay practices. We have coupled external, market-driven data with an equitable performance review assessment tool to strike the balance that best represents our compensation strategy and links pay to performance. On an annual basis, our Human Resources department evaluates market compensation ranges for each position to ensure we are appropriately compensating our top performers. We believe this total rewards program directly aligns with our compensation and benefits strategy. 
 Our employee benefit programs are designed to meet the needs of our diverse workforce, support our employees and their families by offering comprehensive and competitive programs that provide flexibility and choice in coverage, make available valuable resources to protect and enhance financial security and help balance work and personal life. Some of the benefits that we offer our employees include: 
 health (including telehealth), dental and vision insurance, 
 a 401(k) plan with a generous matching contribution, 
 an employee stock purchase plan, 
 health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts, 
 income protection through our sick pay, salary continuation and long-term disability policies and life insurance, 
 a scholarship program for the children of non-officer employees, 
 a commuter subsidy to support the use of public transportation, 
 tuition reimbursement, 
 paid vacation, holiday, personal and volunteer days and paid parental leave to balance work and personal life, 
 back-up child and elder care, and 
 pet insurance. 
 Health, Safety Wellness 
 As one of the largest publicly traded premier workplace REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2022) in the United States, we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health and its importance to our clients and employees. The health, safety and security of our employees, clients, contractors and others are our highest priority. In early 2020, we convened a Health Security Task Force and developed the BXP Health Security Plan, a comprehensive set of building operational measures, to address health and safety measures in our buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some components of the Health Security Plan remained applicable and in place in 2022: we continued to focus on our indoor air quality initiative and installed new indoor air quality monitoring devices across approximately 40 buildings in 2022 that provide real-time indoor air quality data, maintained enhanced air filtration in buildings and continued to conduct air and water quality testing. 
 We believe the success of our employees is dependent upon their overall well-being, including their physical health, mental health, work-life balance and financial well-being. In addition to the benefits outlined above, we also offer our employees an Employee Wellness Program, an Employee Assistance Program and a Mental Health Well-Being Program. The Employee Wellness Program was established in 2016 to encourage employees to improve their health and well-being by offering a variety of activities and engaging content to meet individual wellness goals. Program participants receive a reduction in their health insurance deduction cost. The Employee Assistance Program includes services for childcare, eldercare, personal relationship information, financial planning assistance, stress management, mental illness and general wellness and self-help. BXP offers a premium mental health program that provides online resources and support for employees facing a wide variety of issues.

 Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 
 The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by BXP s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors. 
 Investment Policies 
 Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 
 Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. 
 We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development and redevelopment projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment in select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants. 
 We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio. 
 Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP s common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). 
 Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 
 While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP s qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership. As of December 31, 2022, we had one note receivable outstanding, which was approximately 78.6 million. 
 Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities 
 Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 
 Dispositions 
 We decide to dispose or partially dispose of properties based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that doing so is in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. As of December 31, 2022, we had one property that was subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of the asset or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale in violation of the agreement. The tax protection agreement expires on December 14, 2033, or earlier if certain conditions by the prior owner are met. 
 Financing Policies 
 The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole. However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP s publicly traded debt. A reduction in BPLP s credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates. 
 The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. 
 Policies with Respect to Other Activities 
 As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the Code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP. 
 Governmental Regulations 
 General 
 Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, (1) federal securities laws and regulations, (2) applicable stock exchange requirements, and (3) federal, state and local laws and regulations related to (a) our status as a REIT and other tax laws and regulations, and (b) real property, the improvements thereon and the operation thereof, such as laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, zoning, usage, building, fire and life safety codes, (4) the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury and (5) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition to the discussion below, see Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, and see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.

 Environmental Matters 
 It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. 
 For example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. 
 Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. 
 Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. 
 We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

 Competition 
 We compete in the leasing of premier workplace, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc. 
 Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing premier workplaces are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of client services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of premier workplaces in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective clients, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 
 In addition, we currently have residential properties (including one under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties. As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. 
 Our Hotel Property 
 We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit or loss from operating the property as a hotel. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary. 
 Supplemental United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under United States Federal Income Tax Considerations in the prospectus dated May 22, 2020 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 22, 2020 (such disclosure, the Base Disclosure ). Capitalized terms herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Base Disclosure. 
 On December 29, 2022, the IRS promulgated final Treasury Regulations under Sections 897, 1441, 1445, and 1446 of the Code that were, in part, intended to coordinate various withholding regimes for non-U.S. stockholders. The new Treasury Regulations provide guidance regarding qualified foreign pension funds and are largely consistent with the previously issued proposed Treasury Regulations. 
 Accordingly, the third and fourth sentences of the third paragraph under the heading United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders Dispositions of Stock are hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
 Under Treasury Regulations, subject to the discussion below regarding qualified holders, a qualified controlled entity also is not generally treated as a non-U.S. stockholder for purposes of FIRPTA. A qualified controlled entity generally includes a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities.

 Additionally, the following two paragraphs are added after the third paragraph under the heading United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Stockholders and Potential Tax Consequences of Their Investment in Shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders Dispositions of Stock : 
 Treasury Regulations further require that a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity will not be exempt from FIRPTA with respect to dispositions of USRPIs or REIT distributions attributable to the same unless the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder. To be a qualified holder, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity must satisfy one of two alternative tests at the time of the disposition of the USRPI or the REIT distribution. Under the first test, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder if it owned no USRPIs as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution during which it qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity. Alternatively, if a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity held USRPIs as of the earliest date during the period described in the preceding sentence, it can be a qualified holder only if it satisfies certain testing period requirements. 
 Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign partnership, all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will not be treated as a non-U.S. stockholder for purposes of withholding under FIRPTA. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and they should be carefully considered. Throughout this section, we refer to the equity and debt securities of both BXP and BPLP as our securities, and the investors who own securities of BXP, BPLP or both, as our securityholders. These risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 58 . 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 Our performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. 
 Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in six markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space and/or a reduction in rents. Because our portfolio consists primarily of premier workplace buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for workplaces in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, DC market, we focus on leasing our properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. A reduction in spending by the Federal Government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, in our New York market, we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 In addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an other than temporary impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. An other than temporary impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1) is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2) exceeds its fair value. There can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Enhanced market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the U.S. and global economies, the real estate industry as a whole and/or the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located. Such adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may be due to, among other issues, prolonged labor market challenges impacting the recruitment and retention of talent, continued inflation, high interest rates, and volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic and other conditions, including pandemics, geopolitical instability and other conditions beyond our control. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences: 
 the financial condition of our clients may be adversely affected, which may result in client defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or for other reasons; 
 significant job losses and/or a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate may occur, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 tightening labor market conditions may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain talent, which may result in lack of business continuity and increased costs to address the labor challenges; 
 our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; 
 reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; 
 the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors; 
 one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and 
 to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments. 
 The outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and that of our clients. 
 Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. For example, there remains uncertainty regarding the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and liquidity, and that of our clients. These uncertainties include the emergence of new virus strains, availability of effective treatment, possible future governmental responses and the severity and duration of the indirect economic and social impacts of the COVID 19-pandemic, such as economic downturn, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, inflation, increasing interest rates, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, job losses and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior. These uncertainties make it impossible for us to predict with certainty the overall impact that COVID-19 will have on us and our clients prospectively. Factors related to COVID-19 that have had, or could have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, include: 
 changes made by companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that could lead to a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate, either of which could adversely affect the overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate; 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 reduced economic activity and/or supply chain disruptions or delays in delivery of products, services or other materials necessary for our clients that impact our clients businesses, financial condition or liquidity has caused, and may continue to cause, one or more of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us, including their ability to make timely rental payments, in full or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations, including rent concessions, deferrals or abatements, or to declare bankruptcy. Any one or more of the foregoing could: 
 reduce our cash flows, 
 adversely impact our ability to finance, refinance or sell a property, 
 adversely impact our ability to continue paying distributions to our equityholders at current levels, or at all, and 
 result in additional legal and other costs to enforce our rights, collect rent and/or re-lease the space occupied by the distressed client; 
 the degree to which our clients businesses have been, and continue to be, negatively impacted has required, and may in the future require, us to write-off a client s accrued rent balance and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity; 
 new laws, governmental policies, and similar actions, including legal restrictions on prosecutions, could adversely impact public safety and thereby adversely affect (1) the desirability of clients to lease space in our properties or markets, and (2) businesses office re-population plans; 
 the impact of COVID-19 could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charge is taken; 
 we may be unable to restructure or amend leases with certain of our clients on terms favorable to us or at all; 
 the impact and validity of interpretations of lease provisions and applicable laws related to claims by clients regarding their obligations to pay rent as a result of COVID-19, and any adverse court rulings or decisions interpreting these provisions and laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity; 
 the impact of governmental and business travel limitations and restrictions have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on the operator of our hotel property, which negatively impacts our revenues, and may result in sustained decreased demand for hotel stays; 
 the extent of labor shortages, disruptions in the supply chains, inflation impacting costs of materials, delays in permitting or inspections, and other factors could result in our failure to meet the development milestones set forth in any applicable lease agreement, which could provide the client the right to terminate its lease or entitle the client to monetary damages, delay the commencement or completion of construction and our anticipated lease-up plans for a development/redevelopment project or our overall development pipeline, including recognizing revenue for new leases, that may cause returns on investment to be less than projected, and/or increase the costs of construction of new or existing projects, any of which could adversely affect our investment returns, profitability and/or our future growth; and 
 the potential that business interruption, loss of rental income and/or other associated expenses related to our operations will not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance policies, which may increase unreimbursed liabilities. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Owen D. Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, Douglas T. Linde, President, and Raymond A. Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President. Among the reasons that Messrs. Thomas, Linde and Ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential clients and industry personnel could diminish. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Our Chief Financial Officer and Regional Managers also have strong reputations. Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with clients and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective clients and industry personnel. 
 Risks Related to Real Estate 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. 
 Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties: 
 downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment); 
 changes in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 competition from other office, life sciences, hotel, retail and residential buildings; 
 local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, life sciences, hotel, retail or residential space; 
 changes in interest rates and availability of financing; 
 vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; 
 delays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; 
 increased costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation; 
 changes in space utilization by our clients due to technology, economic conditions and business culture; 
 increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; 
 civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our clients in impacted locations; 
 significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes (including reassessments and changes in tax laws), insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; 
 declines in the financial condition of our clients and our ability to collect rents from our clients; and 
 decreases in the underlying value of our real estate. 
 We face potential adverse effects from major clients bankruptcies or insolvencies. 
 The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major client may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our clients could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a client solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt client may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

 Our properties face significant competition. 
 We face significant competition from developers, owners and managers of office, life sciences and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our clients. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain clients and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties. 
 We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space. 
 We derive most of our income from rent received from our clients. If a client experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our clients decide not to renew their leases, renew for less space or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space. Even if clients decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to clients, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected. 
 Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs. 
 We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, life sciences, retail and residential properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks: 
 we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all; 
 we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, increases in interest rates, or supply chain disruptions, any of which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs; 
 we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project; 
 we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and, as a result, we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred; 
 we may expend funds on and devote management s time to projects that we do not complete; 
 we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and 
 we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted. 
 Investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated. 
 Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks: 
 we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than projected, or at a slower pace than projected, at the time we decide to undertake the development; 
 operating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and 
 occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.

 We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. 
 We operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixed-use developments. This means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes. We have less experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate than we do with office real estate. As a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. If we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). In the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. If we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us. 
 Our use of joint ventures and participation in the Strategic Capital Program may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire. 
 In appropriate circumstances, we intend to acquire and recapitalize or develop, as applicable, properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities. We currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements. Our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks, including but not limited to, the following risks that: 
 our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property, its operation or, if applicable, the commencement of development activities, and a dispute with any of our joint venture partners could lead to the sale of a partner s ownership interest in the venture or the property at a time or price that we do not find attractive; 
 some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and, depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls; 
 our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements; 
 our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest; 
 our joint venture partners may default on their obligations, which could necessitate that we fulfill their obligations ourselves; 
 our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them; 
 our joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale or sale of the entire asset; 
 as the general partner or managing member of a joint venture, we could be generally liable under applicable law for the debts and obligations of the venture, and we may not be entitled to contribution or indemnification from our partners; 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 our joint venture agreements may contain provisions that allow our partners to remove us as the general partner or managing member for cause, and this could result in liability for us to our partners under the governing agreement of the joint venture; 
 we may need our partner(s) approval to take certain actions and, therefore, we may be unable to cause a joint venture to implement decisions that we consider advisable; and 
 with respect to our participation in the co-investment program, we could lose opportunities to pursue properties that are within the program s target investment criteria alone or with other partners with whom the terms of the joint venture and/or our returns could be more favorable to us. 
 We face the risk that third parties will not be able to service or repay loans we make to them. 
 From time to time, we have loaned and in the future may loan funds to (1) a third-party buyer to facilitate the sale of an asset by us to such third party, or (2) a third party in connection with the formation of a joint venture to acquire and/or develop a property. Making these loans subjects us to the following risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and/or financial condition: 
 the third party may be unable to make full and timely payments of interest and principal on the loan when due; 
 if the third-party buyer to whom we provide seller financing does not manage the property well, or the property otherwise fails to meet financial projections, performs poorly or declines in value, then the buyer may not have the funds or ability to raise new debt with which to make required payments of interest and principal to us; 
 if we loan funds to a joint venture, and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest or principal, or both, or there are disagreements with respect to the repayment of the loan or other matters, then we could have a resulting dispute with our partner(s), and such a dispute could harm our relationship(s) with our partner(s) and cause delays in developing or selling the property or the failure to properly manage the property; and 
 if we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest and principal, or both, then we may exercise remedies available to us in the joint venture agreement that could allow us to increase our ownership interest or our control over major decisions, or both, which could result in an unconsolidated joint venture becoming consolidated with our financial statement; doing so could require us to reallocate the purchase price among the various asset and liability components and this could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition. 
 We face risks associated with property acquisitions. 
 We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: 
 even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs; 
 we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; 
 acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; 
 the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates; 
 the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied; 
 acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;

 we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. Investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that BXP continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs. If we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, BXP could fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrower s default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments. There can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy. 
 We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. 
 Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability. 
 We may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: 
 liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination; 
 claims by clients, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties; 
 liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and 
 claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 
 Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties. 
 We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: 
 we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and 
 even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price. 
 We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility. 
 Properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. Properties that we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or that we acquired through tax deferred contribution

 transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. Furthermore, as a REIT, BXP may be subject to a 100 prohibited transactions tax on the gain from dispositions of property if BXP is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Code applicable to REITs, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which are intended to qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants). 
 Because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry. 
 The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property: 
 our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners; 
 if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates; 
 our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and 
 our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism. 
 In addition, because our hotel property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge market s fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply. 
 Failure to comply with Federal Government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. Government was one of our largest clients by square feet. We are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a Federal Government contractor. These laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. Our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the Federal Government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the Federal Government. There can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. 
 Changes in rent control or rent stabilization and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and residential property values. 
 Various state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, such as pet fees or application fees. We have seen a recent increase in governments considering, or being urged by advocacy groups to consider, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. Depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues, such future enactments could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and the value of our residential properties. 
 State and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants rights laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and the value of our residential properties. If we are restricted from re-leasing apartment units due to the inability to evict 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 delinquent residents, our results of operations and property values for our residential properties may be adversely affected. 
 We did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during BXP s initial public offering. 
 We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of BXP s initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. To the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of BXP, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of BXP, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. 
 Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. 
 Our property insurance program per occurrence limits are 1.0 billion for our portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism Terrorism Coverage ). We also carry 1.35 billion of property insurance in excess of the 1.0 billion of coverage in our property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting of 750 million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of our property insurance program and 600 million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the 1.75 billion of coverage. 
 Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York 767 Fifth Avenue ), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are 1.625 billion, including Terrorism Coverage. We also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA ( NBCR Coverage ), which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is 1.0 billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is 200 million, the coinsurance is 20 and the deductible is 20 of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim. If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA. We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance. 
 We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a 330 million per occurrence limit, and a 330 million annual aggregate limit, 30 million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 3 of the value of the affected property. In addition, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our Seattle region with a 110 million per occurrence limit, and a 110 million annual aggregate limit. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 2 of the value of the affected property. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. We may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage. 
 36

 IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and our NBCR Coverage. Insofar as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of 20.0 million. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes and pandemics, in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. 
 Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties. 
 We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. As a result, some clients in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. See also Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. 
 We face risks associated with our clients and contractual counterparties being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
 Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury OFAC maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned Prohibited Persons ). OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the OFAC Requirements ). Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements. We have established a compliance program whereby clients and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. Our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements. If a client or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful. 
 We face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change . 
 The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. For example, many of our properties are located along the East and West coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, rising sea-levels and/or drought. Over time, these conditions could result in 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 declining demand for office space in our buildings or increased costs associated with infrastructure-related remediation projects. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by making property insurance unavailable or by increasing the cost of (i) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, (ii) real estate taxes or other assessments, (iii) energy and (iv) property maintenance. In addition, we face transition risks related to federal, state and local legislation and regulations that are being implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change. The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including GHG emissions regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results. 
 For additional discussion regarding our approach to climate resiliency and our continued commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators, see Item 1. Business Business and Growth Strategies Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and our annual ESG report available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. 
 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. 
 Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs. 
 These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a 20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of 40 million. The presence or migration of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to third-party claims for bodily injury, property damage and/or response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. Changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures. 
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. For example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos: 
 properly manage and maintain the asbestos; 
 notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and 
 undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. 
 Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. 
 Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that: 
 the environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities; 
 a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments; 
 new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and 
 future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us. 
 Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other adverse health effects. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, special cleaning measures and steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property s clients or require rehabilitation of the affected property. 
 Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that certain buildings, including office buildings, residential buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders. 
 Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
 Any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business. 
 We have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real estate-related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. If we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures. In addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. 
 Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act.

 We may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. 
 If we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing 
 An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all. 
 As of February 21, 2023, we had 1.2 billion outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at a variable rate, and we may incur more indebtedness in the future. Interest rates increased throughout 2022, and if interest rates continue to increase, then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 
 Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to modify or discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms. 
 We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. 
 We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future. 
 We have had and may in the future have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt. As of December 31, 2022, we had one tax protection agreement that could restrict our ability to repay or finance debt. 
 Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities. 
 As of February 21, 2023, our Consolidated Debt was approximately 14.7 billion (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt). 
 The following table presents Consolidated Market Capitalization as well as the corresponding ratios of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization (dollars and shares / units in thousands):

 (1) Values are based on the closing price per share of BXP s Common Stock on February 21, 2023 of 68.44. 
 (2) Includes LTIP Units (including 2012 OPP Units and earned MYLTIP Units that were granted between 2013 - 2020), but excludes MYLTIP Units granted between 2021 and 2023 because the performance period for those awards has not yet ended. 
 Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of BXP s stock price, or BPLP s ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.

 The discontinuation of LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations. 
 We expect that all LIBOR settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR will not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or hedging transactions, but if our contracts indexed to LIBOR are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest or hedging costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available. Additionally, although SOFR is the recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacements that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in ways that would result in higher interest or hedging costs for us. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR s end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, each of the agreements governing our variable rate debt either have been transitioned to SOFR or provide for the replacement of LIBOR if it becomes unavailable during the term of such agreement. 
 We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments. 
 We may invest cash balances in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly): 
 direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; 
 obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies; 
 taxable municipal securities; 
 obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts; 
 commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks; 
 repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations; 
 both registered and unregistered money market funds; and 
 other highly rated short-term securities. 
 Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP. 
 Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on BXP s stockholders. 
 Some holders of interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to BXP and its stockholders. Consequently, such holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While BXP has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of BXP s Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of BXP s stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.

 Agreement not to sell some properties. 
 We have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributors. In addition, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. 
 Also, BPLP has had and may have in the future agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that BPLP may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because doing so would require BPLP to make payments to the prior owners if BPLP violates these agreements. 
 Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders. 
 Provisions in BXP s charter and bylaws, BXP s shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may: 
 delay or prevent a change of control over BXP or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to BXP s stockholders; and 
 limit BXP s stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices. 
 Stock Ownership Limit 
 To facilitate maintenance of BXP s qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, BXP s charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. BXP s Board of Directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize BXP s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under BXP s charter, each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of BXP s equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. 
 BPLP s Partnership Agreement 
 BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than BXP receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of BXP common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of BXP common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which BXP receive the approval of its common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. Therefore, if BXP s common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction: 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including BXP, must vote on the matter; 
 BXP must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction; and 
 the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved. 
 With respect to specified extraordinary transactions, BXP has agreed in BPLP s partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction. 
 As a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and BXP may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though BXP stockholders approve of the transaction. 
 We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders. 
 Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by BXP s Board of Directors. Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies. 
 Risks Related to BXP s Status as a REIT 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends. 
 If BXP fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. We believe that BXP is organized and qualified as a REIT and intends to operate in a manner that will allow BXP to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that BXP is qualified as such, or that it will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. 
 In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then BXP may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT then, unless certain relief provisions apply, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because: 
 BXP would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; 
 BXP also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before January 1, 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and 
 unless BXP is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, BXP could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified. 
 In addition, if BXP fails to qualify as a REIT and the relief provisions do not apply, it will no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, BXP s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of BXP s common stock. If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT but is eligible for certain relief provisions, then it may retain its status as a REIT, but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.

 In order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 
 In order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as a REIT, BXP generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments. In addition, BXP will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of ordinary income, 95 of capital gain net income and 100 of undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain BXP s REIT status. 
 We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. BXP, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation. 
 We face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws. 
 Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of BXP s common stock. 
 As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of BXP s common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of BXP s common stock are the following: 
 the extent of investor interest in our securities; 
 the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies; 
 our underlying asset value; 
 investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally; 
 national economic conditions; 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 changes in tax laws; 
 our financial performance; 
 changes in our credit ratings; 
 differences between the yields paid on other investments available in the market and BXP s dividend yield; and 
 general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates. 
 The market value of BXP s common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, BXP s common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than BXP s net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of BXP s common stock will diminish. 
 Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders. 
 The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. 
 The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of BXP s stock. 
 In connection with and subsequent to BXP s initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of BXP or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of BXP common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of BXP s common stock. 
 Our involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties in which such parties have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and/or added as an additional insured under certain insurance policies. An unfavorable resolution of any legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. Regardless of its outcome, legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management. With respect to any legal proceeding or other claim, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail, or achieve a favorable settlement or outcome, or that our insurance or the insurance and/or any contractual indemnities of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties will be enough to cover all of our defense costs or any resulting liabilities. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients.

 The Audit Committee of BXP s Board of Directors oversees our risk management processes related to cybersecurity. It meets no less frequently than annually with our IT personnel and senior management to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and our strategy to defend our IT networks, business systems and information against cyber attacks and intrusions. Under the oversight of the Audit Committee, we established our overall cybersecurity program and its standards by reference to the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Cyber Security Framework. As part of our overall cybersecurity program: 
 we have implemented a continuous improvement methodology including, but not limited to, ongoing enhancements to processes and controls, quarterly control reviews, annual policy reviews, biannual penetration tests and annual investments in our security infrastructure; 
 we annually assess our cybersecurity program against the NIST framework and periodically engage an outside consulting firm to conduct the assessment; and 
 we conduct cybersecurity awareness training at least three times per year for our employees and primary on-site providers, and we conduct ongoing phishing simulations to raise awareness of spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and other critical security threats. 
 Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases, are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. 
 Like other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees. To date, these events have not adversely affected our operations or business and have not been material, either individually or in the aggregate. However, a security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could: 
 disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our clients; 
 result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines; 
 result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding BXP s qualification as a REIT; 
 result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; 
 result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our clients for the efficient use of their leased space; 
 require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; 
 subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; and 
 damage our reputation among our clients and investors generally. 
 Any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our clients. 
 Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Changes include, but are not limited to, changes in revenue recognition, lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fair-value measures. 
 These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. Similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our clients reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our clients preferences regarding leasing real estate.

Should one or more of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance or occurrences and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. 
 The most significant factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements include the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of changes in general economic and capital market conditions, including continued inflation, increasing interest rates, supply chain disruptions, labor market disruptions, dislocation and volatility in capital markets, and potential longer-term changes in consumer and client behavior resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy, as well as the other important factors below and the risks set forth in this Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A. 
 Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 volatile or adverse global economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could adversely affect our access to cost-effective capital and have a resulting material adverse effect on our business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition; 
 risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, continued inflation, increasing interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; 
 general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, changes in client preferences and space utilization, dependence on clients financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); 
 the impact of geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing war in Ukraine;

 Overview 
 BXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2022) in the United States that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the United States - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other client s expansion rights and general economic factors. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients. Our client base is diverse across market sectors and the weighted-average lease term for our in-place leases, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years, as of December 31, 2022, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The weighted-average lease term for our 20 largest clients, based on leased square footage, was approximately 10.7 years as of December 31, 2022. 
 To be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. In this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes: 
 our understanding of our client s short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets; 
 our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner; 
 our reputation as a high quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets; 
 our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards; and 
 our relationships with local brokers. 
 Outlook 
 The inflation experienced in 2022 has slowly decreased but remains high. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue to increase interest rates, although likely at a more moderate pace, in an effort to bring prices under control. This, coupled with the discussion surrounding raising the U.S. debt ceiling could cause further turmoil in the financial markets. There have already been signs of this strain with announcements of staff reductions from large- and medium-sized employers. While the initial announcements were largely concentrated in the technology sectors, companies in the finance industry, the legal industry and broader corporate America are now announcing similar layoffs. This evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as: 
 business leaders may generally become more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as entry into a new lease; 
 labor market conditions shift resulting in increasing employer demands for mandatory in-person workdays and gradual increases in space utilization by our clients; 
 our capital costs have increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and 
 construction costs have increased for new development and, although the costs for our active development pipeline are, at this stage, relatively fixed, the cost of potential future developments continues to increase. 
 In light of the foregoing, we believe we are positioning ourselves for success, notwithstanding the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, by managing our leverage while continuing to selectively invest (including both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. We remain focused on the following priorities: 
 continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace industry and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. Premier workplaces, the preferred choice for our current and prospective clients, are gaining market share compared to general office space and demonstrating the highest occupancy, net absorption levels and rental rates in the central business district CBD markets where we operate; 
 leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations; 
 completing the construction and leasing of our development properties; 
 pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development; 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 continuing to raise the bar in the quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, which may be negatively impacted by a slowdown in the capital markets and the limited availability of private market debt financing; 
 actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and 
 prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments. 
 The following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Leasing Activity and Occupancy 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed approximately 1.1 million square feet of new leases and renewals, for a total of approximately 5.7 million square feet leased in 2022, which is 95 of our average annual leasing volume over the last ten years. The leases executed in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 have a weighted-average lease term of approximately 7.8 years and 9.2 years, respectively, indicating that many new and existing clients continue to commit to the long-term use of space and view our properties as their preferred choice for a premier workplace environment. 
 The overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 88.6 at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 30 basis points from September 30, 2022. The decrease in occupancy is primarily due to fully placing in-service Reston Next and 880 Winter Street, which have leases for which revenue recognition has not commenced in accordance with GAAP. Excluding the impact of placing these two properties in-service, occupancy would have increased in the fourth quarter of 2022 by 20 basis points to 89.1 . 
 The macroeconomic environment has resulted in softening demand in all of our markets. While property tours continue and leases under negotiation move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. Potential clients touring space acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions. As we consider our expectations for leasing in 2023, we have factored in the impacts of a slower economy, softer business performance, and reduced demand for space. We expect the bulk of our leasing in 2023 will continue to come from small- and medium-sized professional and financial services firms. 
 Investment Activity 
 Although the real estate capital markets for office assets has slowed substantially with U.S. transaction volume down 40 in the fourth quarter of 2022 from the third quarter of 2022, we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet client demand for premier workplaces, life sciences, retail and residential space. We continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of value-add assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets. 
 Consistent with this strategy, in 2022, we purchased an aggregate of approximately 1.6 billion (our share) of premier workplaces, including life sciences, and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns a premier workplace. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired a 26.69 interest in the joint venture that owns 200 Fifth Avenue, a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square-foot, LEED Gold certified, premier workplace located in New York City that is approximately 93 leased as of December 31, 2022. The acquisition of the joint venture interest is our second investment in the vibrant Midtown South neighborhood. We serve as the managing member and provide customary leasing and property management services for the joint venture. We closed on the interest in the joint venture for a gross purchase price of approximately 280.2 million, which includes 120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of 160.1 million. The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.30 per annum and matures on November 24, 2028. The joint venture has interest rate swap contracts through June 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34 per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of 13 properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 1.9 billion, of which approximately 729.1 million remains to be invested. In January 2023, BXP commenced the development of 290 Binney Street and the redevelopment of 300 Binney Street at Kendall Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Including projects that commenced in January 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment which, excluding View Boston at The Prudential Center and 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 Reston Next Residential, are 52 pre-leased as of February 21, 2023. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 3.3 billion. 
 As we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the disposition of The Avant at Reston Town Center for a gross sale price of 141.0 million. The Avant at Reston Town Center a is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury residential building located in Reston, Virginia. BXP retained ownership of the approximately 26,000 square foot ground-level retail space. 
 Including the sale of the residential component of The Avant at Reston Town Center, BXP completed the disposition of 14 properties and two land parcels, for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately 864.2 million, in 2022.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following: 
 Purchase price allocations, 
 Impairment and 
 Impairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Each of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below. 
 Real Estate 
 Purchase Price Allocations 
 We assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. 
 We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Acquired above- and below-market lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Madison Centre in Seattle, Washington and 125 Broadway in Cambridge, Massachusetts for an aggregate net purchase price of approximately 1.3 billion. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Impairment 
 Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Because cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. 
 Unconsolidated Joint Venture s 
 Impairment 
 Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately 1.6 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately 85.4 million included within Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of approximately 50.7 million related to our Dock 72 unconsolidated joint venture (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Income Taxes 
 Our accounting policies related to income tax are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 BXP 
 The net difference between the tax basis and the reported amounts of BXP s assets and liabilities was approximately 2.1 billion and 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was primarily related to the difference in basis of contributed property and accrued rental income. 
 Certain entities included in BXP s Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to certain state and local taxes. These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 194 and 201 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios. 
 In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. 
 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) preferred stock/unit redemption charge, preferred dividends/distributions, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses from early extinguishment of debt, unrealized loss on non-real estate investment, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) gains (losses) from investments in securities, other income - assignment fee, interest and other income (loss), gain on sales-type lease, gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently. 
 We believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP OP Units ). This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021 
 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 124 properties totaling approximately 37.8 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2021 and owned and in service through December 31, 2022. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment after January 1, 2021 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2022. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in development or redevelopment or sold.

 Same Property Portfolio 
 Lease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income) 
 Lease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately 82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately 2.96, contributing approximately 99.3 million, partially offset by average occupancy decreasing from 91.7 to 91.1 , resulting in a decrease of approximately 17.2 million. 
 Termination Income 
 Termination income decreased by approximately 4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to approximately 29 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 6.7 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in New York City. In addition, we received a distribution from our unsecured credit claim against Lehman Brothers, Inc. of approximately 0.6 million. 
 Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to 27 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 11.5 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in New York City and the Boston region. 
 Parking and Other Revenue 
 Parking and other revenue increased by approximately 19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Parking revenue increased by approximately 19.7 million and was partially offset by a decrease in other revenue of approximately 0.4 million. The increase in parking revenue was primarily due to an increase in transient and monthly parking primarily in the Boston region. 
 Real Estate Operating Expenses 
 Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately 66.8 million, or 7.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase in operating expenses, including cleaning, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and roads/grounds/security. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in physical occupancy. 
 Properties Acquired Portfolio 
 The table below lists the properties acquired between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2022. Rental revenue and real estate operating expenses increased by approximately 50.1 million and 10.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, as detailed below.

 Residential Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income for our residential same properties increased by approximately 9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in net operating income was primarily due to the initial lease-up of the Skylyne, which was fully placed in-service during the third quarter of 2020.

 (1) Average Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. 
 (2) Average Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 
 (3) Average Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current

Table of Contents 

 Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property s total possible gross revenue. Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. 
 Hotel Net Operating Income 
 The Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately 12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately 11.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. As demand for travel has returned, the Boston Marriott Cambridge has seen an increase in occupancy and room rates, which has led to increased net operating income.

 Other Operating Revenue and Expense Items 
 Development and Management Services Revenue 
 Development and management services revenue increased by approximately 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Management services revenue increased by approximately 2.3 million and development services revenue decreased by approximately 1.9 million. The increase in management services revenue was primarily related to an increase in property management fees from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Boston region and asset management fees from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Los Angeles and Seattle regions. The decrease in development services revenue was primarily related to a decrease in development fees earned from unconsolidated joint venture properties in the Washington, DC and Boston regions, which were placed in-service during prior periods. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense decreased by approximately 5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense of approximately 11.9 million, partially offset by an approximately 6.7 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately 12.1 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan and an approximately 0.2 million increase in other compensation expenses. The increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase in professional fees. 
 Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately 16.1 million and 13.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. 
 Transaction Costs 
 Transaction costs decreased by approximately 2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to costs incurred in connection with the pursuit and formation of new joint ventures in 2021 that did not occur at the same levels in 2022. In general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred.

 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts 
 We have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other. 
 Other Income and Expense Items 
 Loss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately 57.3 million primarily due to (1) a 50.7 million non-cash impairment charge at our Dock 72 joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2022, (2) a 10.3 million gain on sale of investment from the sale of our Annapolis Junction joint venture interest during the year ended December 31, 2021 and (3) an increase in interest expense due to increasing interest rates on variable rate debt. 
 The unconsolidated joint venture properties have approximately 4.0 billion of outstanding debt, which is primarily variable rate. Therefore, we expect our share of joint venture income to be impacted by higher interest rates. 
 Gains on Sales of Real Estate 
 Gains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold.

 Gain on sales-type lease 
 In connection with a ground lease amendment, executed on December 19, 2022 with a third-party hotel developer, we recorded a sales-type lease receivable of approximately 13.0 million, which includes an unguaranteed residual asset of approximately 17,000. The sales-type lease receivable was measured as the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including the unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. In addition, we recorded a gain on sales-type lease of approximately 10.1 million associated with the derecognition of the asset. We did not recognize any interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022 (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Interest and Other Income (Loss) 
 Interest and other income (loss) increased by approximately 6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, due primarily to an increase of approximately 7.3 million in interest income due to increased interest earned on our deposits. 
 Other Income - Assignment Fee 
 On April 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 Roger Bacon Drive in Reston, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5.6 million. On April 7, 2022, we executed an agreement to assign the right to acquire 11251 Roger Bacon Drive to a third party for an assignment fee of approximately 6.9 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately 6.6 million. 11251 Roger Bacon Drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres. 
 Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities 
 Gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP s officers and former non-employee directors. Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income or the non-employee director s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. In order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately (6.5) million and 5.6 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately (6.5) million and 5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans. 
 Unrealized Loss on Non-Real Estate Investment 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we began investing in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds. As a result, we recognized an unrealized loss of 0.2 million due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments. 
 Losses From Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 On February 14, 2021, BPLP completed the redemption of 850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.125 senior notes due May 15, 2021. The redemption price was approximately 858.7 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately 8.7 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately 0.4 million related to unamortized origination costs. 
 On March 16, 2021, BPLP repaid 500.0 million, representing all amounts outstanding on its delayed draw term loan facility Delayed Draw Facility under its prior unsecured revolving credit agreement. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately 0.5 million related to the acceleration of remaining unamortized financing costs. 
 On October 15, 2021, BPLP used proceeds from its September 2021 offering of unsecured senior notes and borrowings under its new credit facility, which replaced the prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the 2021 Credit Facility to complete the redemption of 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.85 senior notes due February 1, 2023. The redemption price was approximately 1.05 billion. The redemption price included approximately 7.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 104.284 of the principal amount being redeemed. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately 44.2 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately 42.8 million. 
 On December 10, 2021, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55 interest refinanced the mortgage loan collateralized by its 601 Lexington Avenue property located in New York City with a new lender. The mortgage loan has a principal amount of 1.0 billion, requires interest-only payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.79 per annum and matures on January 9, 2032. The previous mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of approximately 616.1 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.75 per annum and was scheduled to mature on April 10, 2022. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the previous mortgage loan. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately 0.1 million due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

 Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. Interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately 52.1 million and 53.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. 
 We expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates. 
 At December 31, 2022, our variable rate debt consisted of BPLP s 1.5 billion revolving facility (the Revolving Facility and BPLP s 730.0 million 2022 Unsecured Term Loan. T he Revolving Facility and 2022 Unsecured Term Loan had approximately 730.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

 Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership 
 For BXP, noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately 40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to an increase in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2022. Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP s financial statements. 
 Preferred Stock/Unit Redemption Charge 
 On March 2, 2021, BXP issued a redemption notice for 80,000 shares of its 5.25 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock ), which constituted all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, and the corresponding depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of Series B Preferred Stock (the Depositary Shares ). In connection with the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock, all of the Series B Preferred Units, which had terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the Series B Preferred Stock, were redeemed by BPLP. The redemption price per share of Series B Preferred Stock was 2,500, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, totaling 2,516.41 per share. On March 31, 2021, we transferred the full redemption price for all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock of approximately 201.3 million, including approximately 1.3 million of accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, to the redemption agent. The excess of the redemption price over the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Units of approximately 6.4 million relates to the original issuance costs and is reflected as a reduction to Net Income Attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and Net Income Attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders on the Consolidated Income Statement. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: 
 fund normal recurring expenses; 
 meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, Including the 500 million of 3.125 unsecured senior notes maturing September 1, 2023; 
 fund development and redevelopment costs; 
 fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; 
 fund pending and possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests therein; and 
 make the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:

 distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;

 borrowings under BPLP s Revolving Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans; 
 long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); 
 sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate; 
 private equity sources, including through our Strategic Capital Program SCP with large institutional investors; and 
 issuances of BXP equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in BPLP. 
 We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment properties primarily with our available cash balances, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from asset sales and BPLP s Revolving Facility. We use BPLP s Revolving Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. Although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by BPLP, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project s size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

 Lease revenue (which includes recoveries from clients), other income from operations, available cash balances, mortgage financings, unsecured indebtedness and draws on BPLP s Revolving Facility are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. We believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. 
 We expect our primary uses of capital over the next twelve months will be to fund the continuation and completion of our current and committed development and redevelopment projects, repay debt maturities (as discussed below), service the interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 13 properties under development or redevelopment. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 1.9 billion, of which approximately 729.1 million remains to be funded with equity through 2026. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we commenced the redevelopment of 105 Carnegie Center in Princeton, New Jersey. 105 Carnegie Center is an approximately 70,000 net rentable square feet property that will be converted into an approximately 73,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences property for an approximate cost of 40.6 million. 
 In January 2023, we added the following new projects to our active development and redevelopment portfolio (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements): 
 290 Binney Steet in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an approximately 566,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project. The project has a total budget of approximately 1.2 billion and is expected to be completed in 2026. The project is 100 pre-leased to AstraZeneca. 
 300 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conversion of this approximately 195,000 net rentable square foot property into an approximately 240,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property has a total budgeted cost of 210.0 million. This project is 100 pre-leased. 
 As of February, 21, 2023, we had 15 properties under development or redevelopment. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 3.3 billion. 
 On November 17, 2022, we acquired a 26.69 interest in the joint venture that owns 200 Fifth Avenue for a gross purchase price of approximately 280.2 million, which include 120.1 million of cash and our pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property of 160.1 million. 200 Fifth Avenue is a 14-story, approximately 855,000 square foot LEED Gold certified, premier workplace located in the Midtown South submarket of Manhattan, New York. The property was 93 leased as of December 31, 2022. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of the residential component of The Avant at Reston Town Center, located in Reston, Virginia, for a gross sale price of 141.0 million. The Avant is a 15-story, approximately 329,000 square foot, excluding retail space, 359-unit, luxury multifamily property. 
 Aggregating our pro rata share of 2022 capital markets activity, we purchased properties or interests in joint ventures that own property of approximately 1.6 billion, sold properties or parcels of land for gross sales prices of approximately 864.2 million, commenced development and redevelopment projects, including projects that commenced in the first quarter of 2023, of approximately 2.0 billion and completed approximately 1.8 billion of debt financing. 
 In July 2021, we announced the formation of the SCP with two partners each having a targeted equity commitment of 1.0 billion and a 250 million commitment from us. Under this agreement, we agreed to provide these partners, for up to two years, exclusive first offers to form joint ventures with us to invest in assets that meet target criteria. All investments are discretionary to each partner. 
 The SCP provides us the opportunity to partner with large institutional investors and capitalize our investment opportunities partially through private equity. The SCP enhances our access to capital and investment capacity, enhances our returns through fee income, and in some investments provides us the opportunity to realize a greater 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 share of income upon achieving certain success criteria. These large financial partners are among the world s largest sovereign wealth funds and pension plans. As we move forward, we anticipate increasing our use of joint venture partner equity to manage our debt levels. 
 On January 4, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement that provided for a 1.2 billion unsecured term loan facility (the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan ). Under the credit agreement, we may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan matures on May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. Upon entry into the credit agreement, we borrowed the full 1.2 billion available under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan, which was scheduled to mature on May 16, 2023. 
 After repayment of the 730.0 million 2022 Unsecured Term Loan on January 4, 2023, our remaining 2023 and 2024 debt maturities include (1) 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of BPLP s 3.125 senior unsecured notes, which mature on September 1, 2023, (2) 700.0 million aggregate principal amount of BPLP s 3.800 senior unsecured notes, which mature on February 1, 2024 and (3) the 1.2 billion 2023 Unsecured Term Loan. In our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, we have approximately 603.2 million (our share) of debt maturating in 2023 and 2024. We expect to fund 2023 and 2024 debt maturities using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on BPLP s Revolving Facility, and/or through refinancings. We expect our interest expense will be materially greater in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the cessation of capitalized interest on our development deliveries, acquisitions funded by debt, higher interest rates on our floating rate debt, and the impact of refinancing our 2023 debt maturities at materially higher interest rates. 
 As of February 21, 2023, we had available cash of approximately 833.3 million (of which approximately 79.9 million is attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). Our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately 1.5 billion available under the Revolving Facility and our available cash, as of February 21, 2023, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced), satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities. 
 We may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. Depending on interest rates, the overall conditions in the debt and public and private equity markets, and our leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources (including utilization of BXP s 600.0 million at the market equity offering program). Doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, which could increase our net interest expense or be dilutive to our earnings, or both. 
 We have not sold any shares under BXP s 600.0 million at the market equity offering program. 
 Inflation 
 We are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation. 
 REIT Tax Distribution Considerations 
 Dividend 
 BXP as a REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that BXP currently distribute at least 90 of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). Our policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100 of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. Common and LTIP unitholders (other than unearned MYLTIP units) of limited partnership interest in BPLP receive the same total distribution per unit. 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 BXP s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate BXP s dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by BXP s Board of Directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount. 
 Sales 
 To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, BXP would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of BXP s common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that BXP would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for BXP to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 
 From time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable REIT regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ). Such a sale by a TRS would be subject to federal and local taxes. 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately 736.8 million and 501.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 235.7 million. The following table sets forth changes in cash flows: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,282,399 1,133,227 149,172 Net cash used in investing activities (1,602,802) (1,039,956) (562,846) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 556,057 (1,311,442) 1,867,499 
 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. The weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.9 years as of December 31, 2022, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 88 to 94 . Generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings. 
 Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is detailed below:

 Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. We present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (A) our consolidated debt by (B) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. Consolidated market capitalization is the sum of: 
 (1) our consolidated debt; plus 
 (2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of BXP Common Stock on December 31, 2022, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of: 
 90 

Table of Contents 

 (i) the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of BXP, 
 (ii) the number of outstanding OP Units in BPLP (excluding OP Units held by BXP), 
 (iii) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and 
 (iv) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units, and 2013 - 2019 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units. 
 The calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2020 - 2022 MYLTIP Units are not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2022. 
 We also present BXP s Share of Market Capitalization and BXP s Share of Debt/BXP s Share of Market Capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that BXP s Share of Debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. BXP s Share of Debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). Management believes that BXP s Share of Debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. We have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. We caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating BXP s Share of Debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. For example, in addition to partners interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters. Moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case GAAP requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that the presentation of BXP s Share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of BXP and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like BXP, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

 Unsecured Credit Facility 
 On June 15, 2021, BPLP amended and restated its prior credit facility (as amended and restated, the 2021 Credit Facility ). The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to 1.5 billion through the Revolving Facility, subject to customary conditions. Among other things, the 2021 Credit Facility (1) extended the maturity date from April 24, 2022 to June 15, 2026, (2) eliminated the 500.0 million delayed draw facility (3) reduced the per annum variable interest rates on borrowings and (4) added a sustainability-linked pricing component. Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP may increase the total commitment by up to 500.0 million by increasing the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. Based on BPLP s December 31, 2022 credit rating, (1) the applicable Eurocurrency and LIBOR Daily Floating Rate margins are 0.775 , (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.15 per annum. The 2021 Credit Facility includes provisions which allow LIBOR Daily Floating Rate to be switched to SOFR. 
 At December 31, 2022 and February 21, 2023, BPLP had no borrowings under its Revolving Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 6.4 million, with the ability to borrow approximately 1.5 billion. 
 Unsecured Term Loans 
 On May 17, 2022, BPLP entered into the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to 730.0 million. The 2022 Unsecured Term Loan was scheduled to mature on May 16, 2023. 
 At BPLP s option, the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) (1) a base rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 , (b) the administrative agent s prime rate, (c) term SOFR plus 1.00 and (d) 1.00 , or (2) a term SOFR rate per annum equal to the forward-looking SOFR term rate administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration CME two business days prior to the commencement of such interest period; or if the rate was unavailable, then the forward-looking SOFR term rate administered by CME on the first business day immediately prior thereto, in each case, plus 0.10 , and (B) a margin ranging from zero to 160 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. 
 On May 17, 2022, BPLP exercised its option to draw 730.0 million under the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan (See Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2022, the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan bore interest at a variable rate equal to term SOFR plus 0.95 per annum based on BPLP s credit rating at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, BPLP had 730.0 million outstanding under its 2022 Unsecured Term Loan. The 2022 Unsecured Term Loan was repaid in full on January 4, 2023 with proceeds from the credit agreement entered into on that date (the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan) as further discussed below. 
 On January 4, 2023, BPLP entered into the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to 1.2 billion. Under the credit agreement, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan matures on May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. 
 At BPLP s option, the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 1/2 of 1 , (b) the administrative agent s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.00 , and (d) 1.00 , in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. 
 On January 4, 2023, upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw 1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan, which was scheduled to mature on May 16, 2023. Based on the BPLP s credit rating upon entry into the credit agreement, the base rate margin is zero basis points and the Term SOFR margin is 85 basis points.

 On November 17, 2022, BPLP completed a public offering of 750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.750 unsecured senior notes due 2027. The notes were priced at 99.941 of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 6.924 per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on December 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately 743.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses. 
 The indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60 , (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50 , (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150 of unsecured debt.

 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt 
 We have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20 to 55 . Seventeen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. As a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately 4.0 billion (of which our

 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 94.9 of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates. 
 At December 31, 2022, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding Consolidated Debt was 3.51 per annum. At December 31, 2022, we had 730.0 million of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding. At December 31, 2022, the GAAP interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 4.85 per annum. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately 7.3 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.

 Funds from Operations 
 Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, for each of BXP and BPLP by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and helps make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. 
 Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 The following table presents the aggregate carrying value of our mortgage notes payable, net, unsecured senior notes, net, unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loans, net and our corresponding estimate of fair value as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 13.5 billion of these borrowings bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 4.85 per annum. The following table presents our aggregate debt obligations with corresponding weighted-average GAAP interest rates sorted by maturity date. 
 The table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.

 At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average coupon/stated rates on the fixed rate debt stated above was 3.51 per annum. At December 31, 2022, our outstanding variable rate debt totaled 730.0 million. At December 31, 2022, the coupon/stated rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 4.85 per annum. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately 7.3 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions, we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. 
 
 We expect that all LIBOR settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR will not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or hedging transactions, but if our contracts indexed to LIBOR are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest or hedging costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available. Additionally, although SOFR is the recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacements that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in ways that would result in higher interest or hedging costs for us. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR s end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, each of the agreements governing our variable rate debt, for our consolidated debt, either have been transitioned to SOFR or provide for the replacement of LIBOR if it becomes unavailable during the term of such agreement.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Table of Contents 

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of Impairment Indicators of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 As described in Notes 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s total real estate balance was 19,496.4 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 1,630.5 million as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Company recognized a 50.7 million other-than-temporary impairment related to an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates, and capitalization rates. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of impairment indicators for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management (a) in identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) when developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management's identification of the indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) management s assumptions related to future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rate and capitalization rate (collectively referred to as the significant fair value assumptions ), and (iii) the audit effort related to management s development of the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to (i) the identification of the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (ii) developing the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment. For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market

 conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical company data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions. 
 Purchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired two properties for an aggregate purchase price of 1,316.7 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements for all acquisitions, (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow methods, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the methods, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rates and capitalization rates by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical company data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rates and capitalization rates assumptions.

Management s Report on Internal Control over 
 Financial Reporting 
 Management of Boston Properties, Inc., the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Boston Properties, Inc. to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of the end of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s 2022 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was effective. 
 Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Boston Properties, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 The effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing on page 120 , which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

 To the Partners of Boston Properties Limited Partnership 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Properties Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Partnership s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements and on the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of Impairment Indicators of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 As described in Notes 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership s total real estate balance was 19,246.5 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 1,630.5 million as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, the Partnership recognized a 50.7 million other than temporary impairment related to an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates, and capitalization rates.

For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the

 reasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical Partnership data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions. 
 Purchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Partnership acquired two properties for an aggregate purchase price of 1,316.7 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements for all acquisitions, (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow methods, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the methods, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rates and capitalization rates by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical Partnership data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rates and capitalization rates assumptions.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 at December 31, 2021) general and limited partnership interest in BPLP. Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the Company refers to BXP and its subsidiaries, including BPLP and its consolidated subsidiaries. Partnership interests in BPLP include: 
 common units of partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units and 
 long term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as LTIP Units 
 Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by BXP. A holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP is obligated to redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the value of a share of common stock of BXP Common Stock ). In lieu of such cash redemption, BXP may elect to acquire the OP Unit for share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that BXP owns, share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. 
 The Company uses LTIP Units as a form of time-based, restricted equity compensation and as a form of performance-based equity compensation for employees, and has previously granted LTIP Units in the form of (1) 2012 outperformance plan awards 2012 OPP Units and (2) 2013 - 2022 multi-year, long-term incentive program awards (also referred to as MYLTIP Units ), each of which, upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based and time-based vesting conditions, is convertible into one OP Unit. The three-year measurement periods for the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2019 MYLTIP Units have ended and BXP s total stockholder return TSR was sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in a portion of the awards. Unless and until they are earned, the rights, preferences and privileges of the 2020 - 2022 MYLTIP Units differ from other LTIP Units granted to employees (including the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2019 MYLTIP Units, which have been earned). Therefore, unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to LTIP Units exclude the 2020 - 2022 MYLTIP Units. LTIP Units (including the earned 2012 OPP Units and the earned 2013 - 2019 MYLTIP Units), whether vested or not, will receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Notes 9, 14 and 16). 
 Properties 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of commercial real estate properties (the Properties aggregating approximately million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately million net rentable square feet. At December 31, 2022, the Properties consisted of: 
 office and life sciences properties (including properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 retail properties (including properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 residential properties (including property under construction ; and 
 hotel. 
 The Company considers premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings and professionally managed and maintained. As such, these properties attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates.

The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary for of the entities that are VIEs as of December 31, 2022. 
 Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 As of December 31, 2022, BXP has identified consolidated VIEs, including BPLP. Excluding BPLP, the VIEs consisted of the following in-service properties: 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), Times Square Tower, 601 Lexington Avenue, Atlantic Wharf Office Building and 100 Federal Street. 
 The Company consolidates these VIEs because it is the primary beneficiary. The third parties interests in these consolidated entities (excluding BPLP s interest) are reflected as noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (See Note 9). 
 In addition, BXP s only significant asset is its investment in BPLP and, consequently, substantially all of BXP s assets and liabilities are the assets and liabilities of BPLP. 
 Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that the Platform 16 Holdings LP joint venture is a VIE. The Company does not consolidate this entity as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the VIE s performance and, therefore, the Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.

 Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Significant betterments are capitalized. When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period. 
 The Company computes depreciation and amortization on properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. The Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciates or amortizes these assets (or liabilities) over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as the revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents cumulative lease/rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 
 The Company must estimate the collectability of its accrued rent and accounts receivable balances related to lease revenue. When evaluating the collectability of tenants accrued rent and accounts receivable balances, management considers tenants creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in tenants payment patterns, on a lease-by-lease basis. The Company writes-off the tenant s receivable balance, including the accrued rent receivable, if the Company considers the balances no longer probable of collection. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. If the Company deems the balances no longer probable of collection, the Company writes

 Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred (See Leases ). The Company receives reimbursements of payroll and payroll related costs from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third party property owners in connection with management services contracts which the Company reflects on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as the Company has determined that it is the principal and not the agent under these arrangements in accordance with the guidance in ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). 
 The Company s parking revenue is derived primarily from monthly and transient daily parking. In addition, the Company has certain lease arrangements for parking accounted for under the guidance in ASC 842 Leases ASC 842 ). The monthly and transient daily parking revenue falls within the scope of ASC 606 and is accounted for at the point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer and the Company s performance obligation is satisfied. 
 The Company s hotel revenue is derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenue is recognized as the hotel rooms are occupied and the services are rendered to the hotel customers. 
 The Company earns management and development fees. Development and management services revenue is earned from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third-party property owners. The Company determined that the performance obligations associated with its development services contracts are satisfied over time and that the Company would recognize its development services revenue under the output method evenly over time from the development commencement date through the substantial completion date of the development management services project due to the stand-ready nature of the contracts. Significant judgments impacting the amount and timing of revenue recognized from the Company s development services contracts include estimates of total development project costs from which the fees are typically derived and estimates of the period of time until substantial completion of the development project, the period of time over which the development services are required to be performed. The Company recognizes development fees earned from unconsolidated joint venture projects equal to its cost plus profit to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. 
 Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 610-20. Under ASC 610-20, the Company must first determine whether the transaction is a sale to a customer or non-customer. The

Because the Company s valuations of its financial instruments are based on the above Levels and involve the use of estimates, the actual fair values of its financial instruments may differ materially from those estimates. 
 In addition, the Company s estimated fair values for these instruments as of the end of the applicable reporting period are not projections of, nor necessarily indicative of, estimated or actual fair values in future reporting periods.

 The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although the Company determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 million from the Company under such agreements, and the Company provided the financing on June 1, 2020. The financing bore interest at a fixed rate of per annum, compounded monthly, and was scheduled to mature on the fifth anniversary of the date on which the base building of the affiliate of The Bernstein Companies hotel property was substantially completed.

 In connection with the redevelopment of the Company s 325 Main Street property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Company was required pursuant to the local zoning ordinance and urban renewal plan to commence construction of a residential building of at least square feet with of the project designated as income-restricted (with a minimum of of the square footage devoted to home ownership units) prior to the occupancy of the 325 Main Street property. Each of the zoning ordinance and urban renewal plan was amended to decouple the residential requirement from the occupancy of the 325 Main Street property. 325 Main Street consisted of an approximately net rentable square foot premier workplace that was demolished and redeveloped into an approximately net rentable square foot premier workplace. While the amendment to the urban renewal plan is subject to completion of administrative processes, the City of Cambridge issued a temporary certificate of occupancy in the second quarter of 2022 (See Note 3). 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Management of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees and/or other financial guarantees. Although the Company s properties are geographically diverse and tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company. 
 Insurance 
 The Company s property insurance program per occurrence limits are billion for its portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism Terrorism Coverage ). The Company also carries billion of property insurance in excess of the billion of coverage in the Company s property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting of million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of the Company s property insurance program and million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the billion of coverage. Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York 767 Fifth Avenue ), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are billion, including Terrorism Coverage. The Company also currently carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA ( NBCR Coverage ), which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer, for the properties in the Company s portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which the Company manages. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is million, the coinsurance is and the deductible is of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim. If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance.

 million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit, million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. In addition, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its Seattle region with a million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. The amount of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Company s ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of its earthquake insurance program on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Company s estimation of the value of the coverage. 
 IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and the Company s NBCR Coverage. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Company s consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Company s NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of million. 
 The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes and pandemics, in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition and results of operations. 
 Legal Matters 
 The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 
 State and Local Tax Matters 
 Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 It is the Company s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with the Company s acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a

When issued, LTIP Units are not economically equivalent in value to a share of Common Stock, but over time can increase in value to one-for-one parity with Common Stock if there is sufficient appreciation in the value of the Company s assets. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of BXP and BPLP. A majority of the grants of restricted common stock and LTIP Units to employees vest in four equal annual installments. Restricted common stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of BXP s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. Because the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2022 MYLTIP Units are subject to both a service condition and a market condition, the Company recognizes the related compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method. Under the graded vesting attribution method, each portion of the award that vests at a different date is accounted for as a separate award and recognized over the period appropriate to that portion so that the compensation cost for each portion should be recognized in full by the time that portion vests. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur on its awards of stock-based compensation. Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Dividends in Excess of Earnings in BXP s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Partners Capital in BPLP s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Aggregate stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock, LTIP Units and 2017 - 2022 MYLTIP Units was approximately million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there was (1) an aggregate of approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units and (2) an aggregate of approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2020 - 2022 MYLTIP Units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years. 
 The shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately million per share weighted-average), million per share weighted-average) and million per share weighted-average) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The deferred stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents as dividends are paid by BXP. The deferred stock units may be settled in shares of Common Stock upon the cessation of such director s service on the Board of Directors of BXP.
