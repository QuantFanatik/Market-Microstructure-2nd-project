collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees
charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the
transaction agreements). However, during the reporting period, the trustee did
not perform any servicing function with respect to the servicing criteria
specified in Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. The master servicer
or the special servicer, to the extent required, performed the servicing
function identified with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, and
each such party included Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB in the
assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant s
attestation report for the subject transaction. As a result, this Annual
Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with
applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of
the 650 Madison Avenue Mortgage Loan have delivered one or more assessments of
compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB. 

 This Annual Report on Form 10-K
includes an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria,
accountants attestation report and servicer compliance statement from
Computershare Trust Company, National Association CTCNA ). CTCNA
was engaged by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ),
in its capacity as certificate administrator and custodian, to perform certain
specified servicing functions identified in the assessment of compliance with
applicable servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports. Wells
Fargo engaged CTCNA in connection with the sale of Wells Fargo s corporate
trust services business to CTCNA and its affiliates. Further, under the
principles-based definition of servicer set forth in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB that looks to the functions that an entity performs, this party
is a servicer for the purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. See 
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).

the related pooling and servicing agreement or trust and servicing agreement
does not perform any activities that address servicing criteria with respect to
the issuing entity and because they are each not a servicer that meets the
criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB.

Servicer. 

 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF
Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number
of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising
similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District
of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York
state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action
based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and
enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches
of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of
default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of
default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and
certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered
judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022,
Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously
settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed
by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In
addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially
similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage
loan documentation. 

 From time to time, CWCapital Asset
Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company CWCAM ), is a party to
lawsuits and other legal proceedings as part of its duties as a special
servicer (e.g., enforcement of loan obligations) and/or arising in the ordinary
course of business. Other than as set forth in the following paragraphs, there
are currently no legal proceedings pending, and no legal proceedings known to
be contemplated by governmental authorities, against CWCAM or of which any of
its property is the subject, that are material to the certificateholders. 

 On December 17, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association, the
trustee under five pooling and servicing agreements for (i) Wachovia Bank
Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C30, (ii) COBALT CMBS Commercial Trust 2007-C2,
(iii) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C31, (iv) ML-CFC Commercial
Mortgage Trust 2007-5 and (v) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-6 commenced
a proceeding with the Second Judicial District Court of Ramsey County,
Minnesota (the State Court for a declaratory judgment as to the proper
allocation of certain proceeds Disputed Proceeds received by CWCAM in
connection with the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town
property in New York, New York securing loans held by those trusts. CWCAM
was the special servicer of such property. The petition requests the State
Court to instruct the trustee, the trust beneficiaries, and any other
interested parties as to the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that
constitute penalty interest and/or the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any,
that constitute gain-on-sale proceeds, with respect to each trust. On
February 24, 2016, CWCAM made a limited appearance with the State Court to file
a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction, mootness,
standing and forum non conveniens. On July 19, 2016, the State Court
denied CWCAM s motion to dismiss. On July 22, 2016, the action was
removed to federal court in Minnesota Federal Court ). On October 21,
2016, the Federal Court held a hearing on the motion to transfer the action to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY
Court ), a motion to remand to state court and a motion to hear CWCAM s request
for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss. On March 14, 2017, the
Federal Court reserved the determination on the motion to hear CWCAM s request
for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss, denied the motion to remand the
matter to state court and granted the motion to transfer the proceeding to the
SDNY Court. Cross motions for judgment on the pleadings were filed but the
SDNY Court was unable to decide the case based on the pleadings and the SDNY
Court ordered discovery. All fact discovery was completed in December,
2018 and expert discovery was completed on March 15, 2019. The parties
submitted cross motions for summary judgment, and on March 19, 2020, the SDNY
Court entered an opinion and order in which it granted summary judgment in
CWCAM s favor and held that CWCAM was entitled to the entire amount of penalty
interest and that CWCAM s determination of Yield Maintenance was correct. 
In the 127-page opinion, the SDNY Court found for CWCAM on every issue
presented by the trustee s petition, namely, that the funds in dispute
constitute penalty interest and yield maintenance, not gain-on-sale proceeds,
and that the amount of penalty interest and yield maintenance was correctly
calculated. An appeal of the SDNY Court s decision was taken on April 29,
2020. Oral argument on the appeal occurred on June 21, 2021. On
July 14, 2022, the Second Circuit entered a decision affirming in part and
reversing in part the SDNY Court s decision and remanding to the SDNY Court for
further proceedings. The Second Circuit affirmed the SDNY s Court holding
that Penalty Interest and Yield Maintenance are paid before Gain-On-Sale
Proceeds. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded for further
proceedings that portion of the SDNY Court s decision related to approximately
 67.2 million in interest on advances. On January 13, 2023, the
parties entered into a settlement agreement, in which (among other things) they
agreed to stipulate that the amount of interest on advances that accrued on or
before June 3, 2014 is 27.5 million, and that CWCAM would pay that amount into
escrow for distribution to certificateholders upon the entry of an order by the
Court approving the settlement. U.S. Bank National Association, as
Trustee for the trusts, provided notice of the settlement to all parties in
interest via a notice program approved by the Court. A hearing on the
settlement is scheduled for March 16, 2023. 

 On December 1, 2017, a complaint against CWCAM and others was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
styled as CWCapital Cobalt Vr Ltd. v. CWCapital Investments LLC, et al., No.
17-cv-9463 (the Original Complaint ). The gravamen of the Original 
Complaint alleged breaches of a contract and fiduciary duties by CWCAM s
affiliate, CWCapital Investments LLC in its capacity as collateral manager for
the collateralized debt obligation transaction involving CWCapital Cobalt Vr,
Ltd. In total, there are 14 counts pled in the Original Complaint. Of those 14,
5 claims were asserted against CWCAM for aiding and abetting breach of
fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. On May 23, 2018, the Original
Complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On
June 28, 2018, CWCapital Cobalt Vr Ltd. filed a substantially similar complaint
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York styled as
CWCapital Cobalt Vr Ltd. v. CWCapital Investments LLC, et al., Index No.
653277/2018 (the New Complaint ). The gravamen of the New Complaint is
the same as the previous complaint filed in the United State District Court for
the Southern District of New York. In total there are 16 counts pled in
the New Complaint. Of those 16 counts, 5 claims were asserted against CWCAM for
aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment,
1 count seeks a declaratory judgement that the plaintiff has the right to
enforce the contracts in question and 1 count seeks an injunction requiring the
defendants to recognize the plaintiff as the directing holder for the trusts in
question. On January 11, 2019, the plaintiff dismissed with prejudice the
declaratory judgment and injunction counts. The New Complaint and related
summons was not served on the defendants until July 13, 2018 and July 16,
2018. The plaintiff s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied by
the court on July 31, 2018. On August 3, 2018, the defendants, including
CWCAM, filed a motion to dismiss the New Complaint in its entirety. On August
20, 2019, the court entered an order granting defendants motion almost in its
entirety, dismissing 11 of the 16 counts and partially dismissing 2 additional
counts. Of the remaining counts, 2 are asserted against CWCAM for aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. On September
19, 2019, CWCapital Cobalt Vr Ltd. filed a notice of appeal relating to the
August 20, 2019 dismissal order and on September 26, 2019, filed an amended
complaint against CWCI and CWCAM attempting to address deficiencies relating to
certain of the claims dismissed by the August 20, 2019 order. CWCI and
CWCAM filed its Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint on October 28, 2019. 
The court heard argument on the Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint on
January 22, 2020 and on October 23, 2020, the court granted the motion
dismissing the amended claims. On November 30, 2020, CWCapital Cobalt Vr
Ltd filed a notice of appeal relating to the October 23, 2020 dismissal
order. On April 27, 2021, the First Department affirmed the dismissal as
to claims against CWCAM that were part of the August 20, 2019 dismissal, but
reversed the dismissal of two counts for breach of the Collateral Management Agreement
against CWCI. CWCI sought leave to file an appeal of the decision. The
plaintiff also sought leave to appeal the dismissal of the claims against
CWCAM. Both requests for leave were denied by the First Department. 
On May 15, 2020, CWCI and CWCAM filed a motion to renew its motion to dismiss
as to 4 of the remaining counts (including the remaining two counts against
CWCAM for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment),
based on a decision entered by Judge Failla in a trust instruction
proceeding in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York
awarding summary judgment in favor of CWCAM. On September 7, 2021, the
court denied the motion to renew. CWCI and CWCAM filed a notice of
appeal, which they perfected by the filing of their opening brief on July 1,
2022. On November 15, 2022, the First Department affirmed the court s
denial of the motion to renew. On October 1, 2021, CWCI and CWCAM moved
to reargue the denial of the motion to renew (or alternatively, the motion to
dismiss) with respect to certain of Cobalt s claims, including the remaining 2
claims against CWCAM, based on the First Department s April 27, 2021
decision. On March 24, 2022, the court denied the relief sought in the
motion to reargue. CWCI and CWCAM have appealed the court s decision on
the motion to reargue and filed their opening brief on July 11, 2022. The
appeal was dismissed as being non-appealable on August 30, 2022. CWCAM
believes that it has performed its obligations under the related pooling and
servicing agreements in good faith and the remaining allegations in the New
Complaint are without merit.

 The report on assessment of
compliance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, furnished pursuant to
Item 1122 of Regulation AB by KeyBank National Association KeyBank ), as
servicer, discloses that the following material instance of noncompliance
occurred with respect to its platform: 

 The examination performed by Ernst Young LLP identified
an instance of material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(4)(ix) of Regulation AB applicable to KeyBank during the year
ended December 31, 2022. During compliance testing, it was discovered, that not
all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within 45-60 days before
the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset documents. Per the
related note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60 days of any
change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification was not
made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The noncompliance
in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which is wholly
owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

 The following remediation procedures have been initiated by
KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the process of being
identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective actions
are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by senior management,
(iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, to include new
tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from recurring in the
future, and (v) training will be provided to the relevant staff members to
prevent a recurrence.

systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such transition as
it relates to the CMBS Platform (defined below).

such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration
statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to
an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any affiliate
thereof (the CMBS Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s sale of the
CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any appointments to
perform trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or
related services on new CMBS transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a
few exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to

Criteria for the Period : Management
has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect
to the CMBS Platform transactions for the Period: 1122(d)(1)(ii),
1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(2)(vi) (the Applicable

3. 
 With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no

perform such activities. 

4. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the (the Applicable

Appendix B to the Company s
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the CMBS Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the
beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the
roles associated with its trustee, securities administration, paying agent
services, and/or related services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for
such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the CMBS Platform
transactions. During the Period, for all the CMBS Platform transactions, Wells
Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer 1 to perform virtually
all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result,
the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the
servicing function with respect to the CMBS Platform and the applicable
servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by
Computershare for the CMBS Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing
Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not
taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the
Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the CMBS Platform, as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means
agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for
assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are
applicable in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Sale
of Corporate Trust Services Business . 
On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold
substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ),
Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust
Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells
Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices
transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B 
for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the Document
Custody Platform (defined below). 

Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform : 
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in
each case for which the Company was appointed to provide document custody
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January
1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS
transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an
exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
(the Document Custody Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s
sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any new
appointments to provide document custody services after November 1, 2021, other
than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to
Computershare. Appendix A identifies the individual transactions
defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the
Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period : Management
has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect
to the Document Custody Platform transactions for the Period: Item
1122(d)(1)(ii) and 1122(d)(1)(iv) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect
to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

With respect to the Document
Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment
of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. 
 Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. 
 Management has assessed the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. 
 Based on such assessment for the Period,
the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period. 

KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect
to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its
roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. 
As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to
Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and
liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the
Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the
Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a
subservicer 1 to perform virtually all of
Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result,
the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the
servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the
applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by
Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare
Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is
taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing
Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. 

1 In this Assessment, the term subservicer means
agent.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare Corporate Trust-
CMBS Platform 

The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the
servicing platform for the period as follows: 

Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

For the CMBS Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related trustee, securities administration, paying agent,
and/or related roles (collectively, the CMBS Platform Roles ), or (ii)
served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS
business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new CMBS transactions for
which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related CMBS
Platform Roles directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall CMBS Platform transactions. For a significant majority of CMBS
Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the
Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related CMBS Platform
Roles (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had
not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the CMBS
Platform Roles for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the
Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of
Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a
result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo
have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the CMBS Platform, and accordingly, the Company is
taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities
performed by the Company for the CMBS Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

Platform : The platform consists of commercial
mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides
trustee, securities administration, paying agent services, and/or related
roles, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of
the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to
a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately
offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the
party for whom it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction
agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the
U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ). 
 Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management
as constituting the CMBS Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing
Criteria : All servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ),
except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
CMBS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the CMBS
Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the
Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and
the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the
transaction agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making
or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in
accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing
Criteria ). 

Third
parties classified as vendors : 
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a
vendor to handle certain Uniform Commercial Code filing obligations required by
the servicing criterion. With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in
the CMBS Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties
by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. In each
case, Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer 
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of each vendor
comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the
vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company
meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for each vendor and
the related servicing criterion. 

With respect to the CMBS
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

1. Management is responsible
for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

2. Management has
assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including
the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 , as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

3. With respect to
Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the CMBS Platform, because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. 

4. Based on such
assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 

 Computershare
Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 

The management Management of
the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company,
National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)
of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing
platform for the period as follows: 

 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells
Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its
Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare
Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare
Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ).
Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS
systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the
sale. 

 For the Document Custody Platform (defined
below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served
directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document
Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who
remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More
specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November
1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which,
during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document
Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). 
The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the
overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant
majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during
all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the
related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role
Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the
Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the
Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during
all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual
duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s
Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the
Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking
responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the
Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022. 

 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December
31, 2022 (the Period ). 

 Platform : 
The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions,
and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for
which the Company provides document custody services ,
either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the
party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the
issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly
offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities
for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after
January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company
(and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity,
other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were
issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
(the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies
the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations,
or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent,
in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s
Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates
to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents
related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the
transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the
Document Custody Platform for the Period. 

 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the
Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain
aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and
related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has
determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii)
applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for
determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI
200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 

 With respect to the Document Custody
Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

 1. Management is responsible for assessing
the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

 2. Management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the
servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI
200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 

 3. With respect to Applicable
Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were
no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the
Company to perform such activities. 

 4. Based on such assessment for the
Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Period.

MANAGEMENT'S
ASSERTION ON COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA 

KeyBank
National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital
Markets, Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance
for the transactions listed on Appendix A for the period January 1, 2022
through December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period ), with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations (the CFR ), except for the servicing criteria
which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable, as indicated on
Appendix B attached hereto (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ), to
the servicing of the transactions listed on Appendix A, backed by commercial real
estate mortgage loans and serviced by the Asserting Party. Although the
Asserting Party is responsible for assessing compliance with Section 229.1122
(d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by
the Asserting Party during the year ended December 31, 2022, that required this
servicing criteria to be complied with. 

The
Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied,
in all material respects, except as discussed in Appendix C, with the
applicable servicing criteria for the transactions listed on Appendix A backed
by commercial real estate mortgage loans serviced by the Asserting Party. 

The
Asserting Party has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by the
servicing criteria as set forth in Appendix B. The Asserting Party has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
applicable to the vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section
200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06. As permitted
by C DI 200.06, the Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable
to the vendor. The Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that
it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and
related criteria. 

Ernst
 Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

 Management s
Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria 

 For
the Period of January 1 through December 31, 2022 

 Appendix
C 

KeyBank
National Association (KeyBank) has identified the following material instance
of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix) during the calendar
year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform. 

1) Servicing Criteria impacted 

1122(d)(4)(ix) Adjustments to interest
rates or rates of return for pool assets with variable rates are computed based
on the related pool asset documents. 

2) Material Instance of
Noncompliance with Servicing Criteria 

During compliance testing, it was
discovered, that not all FlexARM loan mortgagors were offered loan rates within
45-60 days before the rate change date, as required per the related pool asset
documents. Per the Note, if the holder fails to offer a loan rate within 45-60
days of any change date a margin of 2.25 is to be used. Given the notification
was not made to the borrowers, a 3 margin was incorrectly applied. The
noncompliance in Item 1122 (d)(4)(ix) is related to a servicing portfolio which
is wholly owned by the investor and is not held in a publicly traded security. 

3) Remediation 

The following remediation procedures have
been initiated by KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage loans are currently in the
process of being identified, (ii) investor contact has been initiated, (iii)
corrective actions are being considered and will be tracked and monitored by
senior management, (iv) procedures will be reviewed and revised, if necessary,
to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from
recurring in the future, and (v) training will be provided to the relevant
staff members to prevent a recurrence.

8. With respect to servicing
criteria 1122(d)(2)(vii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform

servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. Management is not aware of any
material deficiencies in such policies and procedures or any material instances

vendors. Management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors, The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the
accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC
Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland Loan Services, a division of PNC
Bank, National Association Midland or the Company ), complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for all transactions serviced on the Enterprise! sm 
Loan Management System (the Platform as of December 31, 2022 and for the
year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B),
1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the servicing activities performed by them with respect to the
Platform. Midland s management is responsible for its assertion and for the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

As described in management s assertion, for servicing
criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Company
has engaged certain vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s
interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation
200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in
all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor.
The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related
criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation
200.06. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that
may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and
to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical
requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Midland complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for all transactions
serviced on the Enterprise! Loan Management System is fairly stated, in
all material respects.

Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for
commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company was
appointed to perform trustee, securities administration, paying agent services,
and/or related services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or (b) the issued securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered
pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation
under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided
however that, (i) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered
securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, and
(ii) the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities
were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and
for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined
by Regulation AB) to a party other than Computershare Trust Company or any
affiliate thereof (the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. Appendix A to the ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE
APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA identifies the individual asset-backed
transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the CMBS
Platform. 

Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(2)(vi) are
applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to
the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to Applicable Servicing
Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no
activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 with
respect to the CMBS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. The Company s management
has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are
not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform activities with
respect to the CMBS Platform relating to those servicing criteria. Management
is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on
our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS
Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by
this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may
have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected
the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to
the examination engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
with the aforementioned Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report on Assessment of 2022 Compliance by Pentalpha Surveillance LLC with
Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (Management s Assertion), that
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC)
Regulation AB for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual
obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (Platforms A and B), including
only those asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding the following criteria set forth in
Items 1122(d)(1)(i-v), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi)
and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for Platform A, and servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i-v),
1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and
1122(d)(4)(viii-xv) for Platform B, which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platforms covered by this report. Appendix B to management s assertion
identifies the individual asset-backed transactions defined by management as
constituting Platforms A and B. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our

Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of
the servicing activities related to Platforms A and B, determining whether the
Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset- backed transaction in Platforms A
and B. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising
from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - CMBS Platform that

the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration, paying agent services, and/or related roles, either directly in
the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such
services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for
such CMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement
delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued
securities for such CMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an
exemption from registration and either the Company (and/or the party for whom
it acts agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity (the CMBS Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and
for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv),

1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not
applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party
for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related
transaction agreements with respect to the CMBS Platform for the Period (as
applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however that, with respect
to the CMBS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only
to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received
and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction
agreements, and (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to
the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an
addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the

As described in management's
assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB,
and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB
and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted
that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06.

assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. 

The Company s management is
responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and
securities that comprise the CMBS Platform, testing of selected servicing
activities related to the CMBS Platform, and determining whether the Company
processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the
Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be
independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for the CMBS Platform is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the
offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ), as of December 31,
2022 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(i); 1122(d)(1)(iii); 1122(d)(1)(v); 1122(d)(2)(i-vii);
1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management has determined are
not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the
party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the
related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform
for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations provided however
that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform (a) servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to

removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements. 

As
described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and
1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that
this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j)
of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as
permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC
Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under
Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation
200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that
it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06.

and securities defined by management as constituting the Document Custody

Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about

material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody
Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Park
Bridge Lender Services LLC Management 

We
have examined management of Park Bridge Lender Services LLC s (the Company assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all
transactions for specific pools identified in Exhibit A that are backed by
certain commercial mortgage loans for which the Company processed in its
capacity as trust advisor or operating advisor (the Platform ), excluding
criteria 1122(d)(1)(i) 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(i)-1122(d)(2)(vii),
1122(d)(3)(ii)-1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i) 1122(d)(4)(vi) and 1122(d)(4)(viii)-1122(d)(4)(xv),
which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed
by the Company with respect to the Platform, included in the accompanying
Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB Servicing Criteria dated February 4, 2023 as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s management is responsible
for its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the specified requirements based
on our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the specified requirements is fairly stated, in all material
respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence
about whether management s assertion is fairly stated, in all material
respects. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our
judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
management s assertion, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

We
are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the specified requirements. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria included in the accompanying
Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB Servicing Criteria dated February 4, 2023 as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its
assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
our examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about
compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material
respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a
sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were
limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the
period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have
included servicing activities related to each asset backed transaction
included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period
specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe
that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria Item
1122(d)(1)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities
required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these
vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of
Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted
by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged
by Servicers C DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company
has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects
with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely
responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
C DI 200.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the servicing criteria. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2022, for the commercial mortgage loan platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholder

KeyBank National Association 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion on Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that KeyBank National Association, as
successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc., (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for commercial real estate
mortgage loans platform, except for the instance of material noncompliance
described therein, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for
Item 1122 (d)(3)(i)(b), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(c), 1122 (d)(3)(i)(d), 1122 (d)(3)(ii),
1122 (d)(3)(iii) and 1122 (d)(3)(iv), which the Company has determined are not applicable
to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform
covered by this report as noted in Appendix B of management s assertion. See
Appendix A of management s assertion for the asset backed transactions covered
by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with
those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the
individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of
the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by
Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the
selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for
assessing compliance with Item 1122 (d)(1)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December
31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe
that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Our examination disclosed the
following material noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix)
applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect
to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ix), the servicer did not consistently process
adjustments to interest rates in accordance with pool asset documents. 

We are required to be
independent of Key Bank National Association and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related
to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. 

As described in management s assertion,
for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(4)(xi), the Company has engaged a vendor to
perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has
determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to
the vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all
material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company
is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s
eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, except for the
material noncompliance described in the third paragraph, the Company complied
with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122
(d)(4)(xi) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as
described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board
of Directors and Management of 

 Situs
Holdings, LLC 

We
have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s
Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria Management s Report ), that Situs Holdings, LLC (the Company ), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of SitusAMC Holdings Corporation, complied with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Special Servicing Platform (the
 Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(iv-v),
1122(d)(4)(ix), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) which management has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the
Platform. The Platform consists of the asset-backed transactions and securities
for which the Company acted as special servicer as defined by management in
Appendix B of Management s Report. Management is responsible for the Company s
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform based on our
examination. 

Our
examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the
Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities constituting the Platform and evaluating whether
the Company performed servicing activities related to those transactions and
securities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the period
covered by this report. Accordingly, our testing may not have included
servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security
constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect
material noncompliance that may have occurred prior to the period covered by
this report and that may have affected the Company s servicing activities
during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. 

As
described in Management s Report, the Company engaged various vendors to
perform servicing activities with respect to criteria 1122(d)(2)(vii). The
Company determined that each vendor is not considered a servicer, as that
term is defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and therefore, the Company is
assuming responsibility for compliance with such servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor s servicing activities. In accordance with Regulation AB and its
related interpretations, the requirement for management to assess compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to a vendor s activities is satisfied if
the Company has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether such
vendor s activities comply in all material respects with such criteria.
Compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is achieved if those policies
and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendor s
activities comply with such criteria and those policies and procedures are
operating effectively for the period covered by Management s Report. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination of whether a vendor is or is
not considered a servicer, and therefore, on whether the Company, in its
Management Report, is eligible to elect to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s servicing
activities. 

In
our opinion, management s assertion that Situs Holdings, LLC complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 for the Special Servicing Platform is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

Computershare Limited purchased substantially all of the Corporate Trust
Services business of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo ). During the Reporting Period,

 on Schedule I hereto, Wells Fargo did not transfer 
 its roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles 
 for such transactions to the Company 
 or an affiliate and performed virtually all of its
obligations through the Company as its agent. During the Reporting Period, for
other transactions listed on Schedule 
 I hereto, Wells Fargo transferred its roles, and the duties, 
 rights and liabilities for such roles under
the relevant transaction agreements to the Company 
 (the 2022 Transferred Role(s) Transactions ). Prior 
 to the date of transfer for the 2022 Transferred Role(s) Transactions,
Wells Fargo remained in the related role and performed virtually all of its
obligations through the Company as its agent. On and after the date of transfer
for the 2022 Transferred Role(s) Transactions, the Company assumed the roles
under the related agreements for such transactions. For each transaction listed
thereon, Schedule I hereto identifies the Reporting Period for such
transaction. The Company's obligations as agent for Wells Fargo are set forth in a servicing agreement between the parties.
