Item 1. Business. 

Company History 

 Ethema Health Corporation
(the Company or Ethema ), a Colorado corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on
April 1, 1993, and is the surviving company of a merger, effective February 1, 1995, between the Company and Nova Natural Resources Corporation,
a Delaware corporation Nova Delaware ). The merger was effectuated solely for the purpose of changing the Company s
domicile from Delaware to Colorado. At all times prior to 2001, the Company was engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. Nova
Delaware was the successor entity to Nova Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Power Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
which merged in 1986 the 1986 Merger ). Prior to the 1986 Merger, Nova Petroleum Corporation and Power Resources Corporation
had operated since 1979 and 1972, respectively. In 2001, the Company entered into the electronics business and this business was active
in 2001 and 2002, as part of the Torita Group. After 2002, the Company continued with various stages of development in this business until
2010. 

On April 1, 2010, the Company
changed its principal operations from development stage electronics to healthcare services. On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into
a one year consulting agreement with GreeneStone Clinic Inc., a Canadian corporation Greenestone Clinic ), whereby Greenestone
Clinic provided consulting services for the Company s development and operation of medical clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada.
Specifically, Greenestone Clinic provided medical and business expertise in the initial startup of private clinics and technical assistance
to ensure that the clinics were in compliance with governmental policy and procedure requirements as well as any operational requirements.
At the time of entering into this consulting agreement, Greenestone Clinic operated a clinic at the Muskoka property housing its addiction
treatment clinic and provided endoscopy services. The Company started offering medical services in June 2010, offering various medical
services, including endoscopy, cardiology and executive medicals, which services were subsequently sold. 

On May 15, 2010, the Company
secured a sublease of space (which was previously the Rothbart Pain Clinic) of approximately 8,000 sq. ft. to be used as the Company s
executive offices and to run an endoscopy clinic. The Endoscopy clinic was subsequently sold. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary
GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. GreeneStone Muskoka ), also entered into a lease with the owner of the Muskoka premises
on April 1, 2011 and provided mental health and addiction treatment services and operated an in-patient addiction treatment center at
this location. 

During December 2016, the
Company obtained a license to operate and provide addiction treatment healthcare services in Florida, USA. The company commenced operations
under this license with effect from January 2017. 

On February 14, 2017, the
Company completed a series of transactions (referred to collectively as the Restructuring Transactions ), including a Share
Purchase Agreement (the SPA whereby the Company acquired 100 of
the stock of Cranberry Cove Holdings Ltd. CCH ), which held the real estate on which the Company s GreeneStone Muskoka
operated, an asset purchase agreement (the APA and lease (the Lease whereby the Company sold certain of the GreeneStone Muskoka business assets and leased the real estate to the buyer, and a real estate
purchase agreement and asset purchase agreement whereby the Company purchased the real estate and business assets of Seastone Delray (the
 Florida Purchase ). 

1 

The Share Purchase Agreement 

 Under the SPA, the
Company acquired 100 of the stock of CCH from Leon Developments Ltd. Leon Developments ), a company wholly owned by Shawn
E. Leon, who is the President, CEO, and CFO of the Company Mr. Leon ). CCH owns the real estate on which GreeneStone Muskoka
is located. The total consideration paid by the Company was CDN 3,517,062, including the assumption of certain liabilities of CCH, which
was funded by the assignment to Leon Developments of certain indebtedness owing to the Company in the amount of CDN 659,918, and the issuance
of 60,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to Leon Developments, valued at US 0.0364 per share. 

The Asset Purchase Agreement
and Lease 

 Under the APA, the assets
of GreeneStone Muskoka were sold by the Company, through its subsidiary, GreeneStone Muskoka, to Canadian Addiction Residential Treatment
LP (the Purchaser or CART ), for a total consideration of CDN 10,000,000. The proceeds of the GreeneStone Muskoka
asset sale were used to pay down certain tax debts and operational costs of the Company and to fund the Florida Purchase, mentioned below. 

Through the APA, substantially
all of the assets of GreeneStone Muskoka were sold, leaving Ethema with only the underlying clinic real estate, which the Company, through
its newly acquired subsidiary, CCH concurrently leased to the Purchaser. The Lease is a triple net lease and provides for a five (5) year
primary term with three (3) five-year renewal options, annual base rent for the first year at CDN 420,000 with annual increases, an option
to tenant to purchase the leased premises and certain first refusal rights. 

The Florida Purchases and Business 

 Immediately
after closing on the sale of the assets of GreeneStone Muskoka, the Company closed on the acquisition of the business and real estate
assets of Seastone Delray pursuant to certain real estate and asset purchase agreements. This business is operated through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Addiction Recovery Institute of America, LLC ARIA ). The purchase price for the ARIA assets was US 6,070,000
financed with a purchase money mortgage of US 3,000,000, and US 3,070,000 in cash. 

On April 4, 2017 the Company
changed its Corporate name from Greenestone Healthcare Corporation to Ethema Health Corporation. 

On November 2, 2017, the
Company entered into an Agreement to purchase from AREP 5400 East Avenue LLC the Landlord certain buildings in West Palm
Beach, Florida, totaling approximately 80,000 square feet, on which the Company planned to operate a substance abuse treatment center.
The purchase price of the Property was 20,530,000. The Company made a series of nonrefundable down payments totaling 2,940,546 in 2017
and 2018. The Company could not get the necessary financing to close on the deal. 

On May 23, 2018, the Company
converted the agreement to purchase the buildings from the Landlord into a real property lease agreement with a purchase option. The lease
was for an initial 10 years and provided for two additional 10 year extensions. 

In June 2018, the Company
moved its ARIA operations into the West Palm Beach properties and in September 2018 received a license to operate in-patient detoxification
and residential treatment services. 

In June of 2019, the Company
and the Landlord wished to proceed with marketing the property for sale and agreed to convert the long term lease into a month to month
lease for a reduced amount of space. 

The Company once again had
an opportunity to purchase the property in October of 2019 but could not arrange for sufficient financing to complete the purchase and
the Landlord subsequently entered into a conditional agreement with another purchaser and on December 20, 2019, the Company entered into
an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease agreement on January 31, 2020. 

On
June 30, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement the Stock Purchase Agreement ), whereby the Company agreed to acquire
51 of American Treatment Holdings, Inc. ATHI from The Q Global Trust Seller and Lawrence B Hawkins Hawkins ),
which owned 100 of Evernia Health Services LLC. Evernia ), which operates drug rehabilitation facilities. The consideration
for the acquisition was a loan to be provided by the Company to Evernia in the amount of 500,000. 

2 

The
Company originally had a 180 day option, to purchase an additional 9 of ETHI for a purchase consideration of 50,000. On April 28, 2021,
the Stock Purchase Agreement was amended whereby the option to purchase an additional 9 of ATHI for 50,000 was amended to purchase
an additional 24 , an increase of 15 over the prior option, for 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000. The remaining condition
to closing, the receipt of approval for the change of ownership of the license from the Department of Children and Family Services of
Florida, was satisfied by probationary approval, which was received on June 30, 2021. The Company exercised the option and issued the 100,000,000 shares
of common stock, resulting in the Company owning 75 of ATHI.

P enny Stock 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks.
Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national
securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in
such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level
of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading (b) contains a description of the broker s
or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such
duties or other requirements of the securities laws. (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price (d) contains a toll-free telephone
number for inquiries on disciplinary actions (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading
in penny stocks and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC
shall require by rule or regulation. 

The broker dealer also must
provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock 
(b) the compensation of the broker dealer and its salesperson in the transaction (c) the number of shares to which such bid and
ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock and (d) a monthly
account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. 

5 

In addition, the penny stock rules require that
prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker dealer must make a special written determination
that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt
of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written
suitability statement. 

These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our audited annual financial statements and the
related notes thereto, each of which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties in this Annual Report. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. For additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties. The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations below is based upon only the financial performance of Ethema Health Corporation. 

Our consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). These accounting
principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions
upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions
are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our consolidated
financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates. This discussion and analysis

and 2021, respectively, an increase of 2,843,475 or 181.3 . The increase is due to the consolidation
of a full years trading of Evernia, a West Palm Beach based treatment facility, in the prior year we included Evernia in our consolidated
results with effect from July 1, 2021, the date of acquisition. In addition the facility was expanded during the current year, allowing
for more patients to be treated simultaneously. 

Revenue
from rental income was 377,351 and 374,517 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 2,834 or 0.8 ,
the increase is due to the increase in monthly rental income in terms of the agreement, offset by exchange rate fluctuations, the U.S.
dollar strengthened against the Canadian dollar during the current period.

and 1,940,483 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 2,391,147

 and 60,000 for the years ended December
 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 72,500 or 120.8 .

 132,275 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase
 of 331,403 or 250.5 .
 The increase is primarily due to the expansion of the facility during the current year by increasing the beds available to patients. 

Salaries and wages was 1,962,479 and 712,787 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 1,249,692 or 175.3 .

Depreciation expense was 540,119 and 325,351 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 214,768 or 66.0 . The increase in the depreciation charge was due to the inclusion of Evernia in our consolidated results for the full fiscal year during the current year and the depreciation of newly acquired assets to facilitate the expansion of the facility. 

Operating profit 

The operating profit was
 489,117 and 2,105 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase
of 487,012 or 23,136.0 . The increase is due to the increase in revenues offset by the increase
in expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of Evernia in our consolidated results for the full fecal year during the current year and
the expansion of the facility during the current year, 

Other income 

Other income was 15,760
and 273,373 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, other income includes; (i) the reversal of a 250,000

relief loan was 104,368 and 156,782 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 52,414 or 33.4 . in
2021, we had met all requirements for forgiveness of one of its Covid-19 government relief loans, in 2022, we received partial forgiveness
of a second Covid-19 loan as we only partially met the forgiveness requirements. 

Loss
on advance 

 Loss
on advance was 0 and 120,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 120,000 or 100.0 . The company
wrote off funds advanced to Local link wellness which were deemed to be uncollectible in 2021. 

Fair
value of warrants granted to convertible debt holders 

Fair
value of warrants granted to convertible debt holders was 0 and 854,140 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, a decrease of
 854,140 or 100 . In 2021, we granted warrants to certain convertible debt holders in terms of agreements entered into with them, whereby
any debt issued subsequent to their debt on more favorable terms would result in the debt holders being entitled to the same terms as
issued to the subsequent debt holders. We issued warrants for a total of 195,963,598 shares of common stock which was valued using a Black
Scholes valuation model. 

Penalty
on notes and convertible notes 

Penalty
on notes and convertible notes was 60,075 and
 9,240 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, an increase of 50,835 or 550.2 .

7 

Interest income 

Interest income was 78
and 0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The interest income is immaterial. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was 588,477
and 829,525 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 241,048
or 29.1 , primarily due to the decrease in convertible note funding during the current year. 

Debt discount 

Debt discount was 624,683
and 1,965,551 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 1,340,868 or 68.2 . The decrease is primarily
due to funding arising from other sources without significant debt discount instruments such as warrants being issued to fund operations,
the majority of debt discount has been fully amortized in the current and prior year. 

Derivative liability
movement 

We adopted ASU 2020-06 during
the current year, which eliminated the derivative liability as our convertible notes with down-round features no longer met the definition
of a derivative instrument. The derivative liability movement during the prior year represents the mark to market movements of variably
priced convertible notes and warrants issued during prior years. 

Foreign exchange movements 

Foreign exchange movements
was 1,071,320 and (34,301) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and represents the realized exchange gains and
(losses) on monetary assets and liabilities settled during the current year as well as mark to market adjustments on monetary assets and
liabilities reflected on the balance sheet and denominated in Canadian Dollars. During the current period we disposed of Greenstone Muskoka
resulting in the unrealized translation difference becoming a realized gain. 

Net income (loss) before
taxation 

Net income before tax was
 407,408 and net loss before taxation was (1,854,306) for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, an increase of 2,261,714 or 122.0 . The increase is primarily due
to the acquisition of the Evernia treatment center and the expansion of the facility during the current period. 

Taxation 

Taxation charge was 112,220
and taxation credit was 280,903 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively an increase of 393,123 or 139.9 .
The 2022 charge relates to the profitable Evernia operations, while the tax credit in the prior year arose due to the reversal of prior
years accrual for 250,000 in penalty tax for non-disclosure of foreign entities in the US tax return, a deferred tax movement
of 37,588 on the amortization of licenses which arose on the acquisition of ATHI and Evernia, and a small tax provision on profits realized
on the ATHI and Evernia results. 

Net income (loss) 

Net income was 295,188
and net loss was (1,573,403) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 1,868,591
or 118.8 . The increase is due to the reasons discussed above. 

8 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
generated by operating activities was 1,577,079 and
cash used in operating activities was 85,567 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively an increase of 1,662,646
 or 1,943.1 .
The decrease is primarily due to the following: 

The increase in net income of 1.9 million, as discussed above. 

The decrease in non-cash movements
of (0.3) million, primarily due to the movement in amortization of debt discount of (1.3) million, the movement in fair
value of warrants issued of (0.9) million, offset by the movement in derivative liabilities
of 1.5 million, the movement in depreciation and amortization of 0.2 million and the movement in the amortization of right of use assets
of 0.14 million. 

The release of cash from working capital of 0.1 million. 

Cash
used in investing activities was 0.7 million and 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We invested
 0.4 million in deposits to acquire the building
in which Evernia conducts its operations and the purchase of plant and equipment on the expansion of the Evernia facility. In 2021, we
invested 0.5 million in the Evernia treatment facility based in West Palm Beach, prior to acquisition. We also purchased property and
equipment of 0.1million, primarily to support the Evernia operation during the current year. 

Cash
generated by financing activities was 0.3 million and 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During
2022, we raised 0.7 million in receivables funding and repaid 0.3 million. In addition we raised 0.3 million from related parties and
 0.2 million from promissory notes and repaid 0.3 million. During 2021 we raised 1.2 million and repaid 0.5 million in convertible
notes, primarily to fund the Evernia operations. 

Over
the next twelve months we estimate that the company will require approximately 5.8 million in funding to repay its obligations if these
obligations are not converted to equity. We will need funding for working capital as we continue to seek opportunities for addiction treatment
in the US markets. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure
such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. In the opinion of management, the Company s
liquidity risk is assessed as high.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Ethema Health Corporation 

 West
Palm Beach, Florida 

 Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ethema Health Corporation (the Company) at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows
for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 Basis
for Opinion 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Going
Concern 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of approximately 43.5 million and negative working
capital of approximately 12.7 million at December 31, 2022, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 4. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Critical
Audit Matters 

 The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the
accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

 Accounting
for Embedded Conversion Features on Convertible Notes Refer to Notes 11 and 17 to the Financial Statements 

 The
principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of derivatives is a critical audit
matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the derivative liabilities. This in turn led to a
high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions
related to the valuation models used and related variable inputs used within those models. 

Addressing
the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating
the appropriateness of the valuation techniques; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating
the significant assumptions used by management, including the values of expected volatility and discount rate. Evaluating management s
assumptions related to the volatility amounts and discount rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were
reasonable considering the current and historical performance, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these
assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For
foreign currency transactions, the Company translates these amounts to the Company s functional currency at the exchange rate effective
on the invoice date. If the exchange rate changes between the time of purchase and the time actual payment is made, a foreign exchange
transaction gain or loss results which is included in determining net income for the year.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered in our U.S. Facility: (i) commercial insurers; and (ii) individual
patients and clients. As the period between the time of service and time of payment is typically one year or less, the Company elected
the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 and does not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component. 

The
Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from other payors that receive discounts from established billing rates. The various
managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex, subject to interpretation and adjustment, and may include
multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in the Company s inpatient facilities and cost settlement
provisions. Management estimates the transaction price on a payor-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations
or contract terms. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result
in payments that differ from the Company s estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently,
necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management. 

Settlements
with third-party payors are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future
periods as final settlements are determined. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments and final
settlements. However, there can be no assurance that any such adjustments and final settlements will not have a material effect on the
Company s financial condition or results of operations. The Company s receivables were 337,074 and 176,011 at
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Management believes that these receivables are properly stated and are not likely
to be settled for a significantly different amount. 

The
Company s revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that
reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company derives its revenues from the
sale of its services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be
recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its revenue transactions: 

i. 
 identify the contract with a customer; 

ii. 
 identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

iii. 
 determine the transaction price; 

iv. 
 allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

v. 
 recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

ASC
 Topic 740 contains a two-step
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine
if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including
resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax
benefits within general and administrative expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable,
amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction in general and administrative expenses in the period that such determination
is made. The tax returns for fiscal 2019, through 2021 are subject to audit or review by the US tax authorities, whereas fiscal 2011 through
2021 are subject to audit or review by the Canadian tax authority . 

ii. 
 Liquidity risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company is exposed to liquidity
risk through its working capital deficiency of approximately 12.7 million,
and an accumulated deficit of approximately 43.5 million. The Company is dependent upon the raising of additional capital in order to
implement its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability
to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. In the opinion of management,
liquidity risk is assessed as high, material and remains unchanged from that of the prior year. 

iii. 
 Market risk 

Market
risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises of three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, and other price risk. The Company is exposed to interest
rate risk and currency risk. 

a. 
 Interest rate risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its convertible debt, mortgage loans, short term loans, third party loans and government
assistance loans as of December 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, interest rate risk is assessed as moderate. 

b. 
 Currency risk 

Currency
risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange
rates. The Company is subject to currency risk as it has subsidiaries that operate in Canada and are subject to fluctuations in the Canadian
dollar. A substantial portion of the Company s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars, however net
earnings in foreign currency is minimal and a 5 depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would result
in an immaterial increase or decrease in the Company s after tax net income from operations. The Company has not entered into any
hedging agreements to mitigate this risk. In the opinion of management, currency risk is assessed as low, material and remains unchanged
from that of the prior year. 

c. 
 Other price risk 

Other
price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the
individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. In the opinion
of management, the Company is not exposed to this risk and remains unchanged from the prior year.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021
and 2020 are as follows: 

Prior year adjustment

Foreign exchange differential

 Net taxable loss 

Disposal of subsidiary

() 
 
 Net
 future tax asset 

The
company has established a valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets sufficient to bring its net deferred tax assets to
zero due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. Management has determined it is more likely than not that the
net deferred tax assets are not realizable due to the Company s historical loss position. The valuation allowance for the year
ended December 31, 2022 decreased by .
This was due to the utilization of (3,514,804) of
net operating losses, the generation of additional losses of 4,624,718 and the disposal of a foreign subsidiary with a net operating
loss of ) .

As
of December 31, 2022, the prior three tax years remain open for examination by the federal or state regulatory agencies for purposes of
an audit for tax purposes. 

Pursuant
to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC ), 382, the Company s ability to use its net operating
loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income is limited if the Company experiences a cumulative change in ownership of more than
50 within a three-year period. 

The
Company operates in foreign jurisdictions and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. These audits may result in the assessment of
amounts different than the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The Company liaises with the relevant authorities
in these jurisdictions in regard to its income tax and other returns. Management believes the Company has adequately provided for any
taxes, penalties and interest that may fall due.

Annual
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SEC s rules and forms and that the information is
gathered and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer
(Principal Financial Officer), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that due
to our limited resources our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in providing material information required to be included
in our periodic SEC filings on a timely basis and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure about our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Our internal
control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to our management and board regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The framework used by
management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on that assessment, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective due to material weaknesses related to a limited segregation of duties due to our limited resources and the small number
of employees. Management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness which could result in material misstatements
of significant accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that
would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in
reporting. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding management s
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the rules and regulations of the SEC.
