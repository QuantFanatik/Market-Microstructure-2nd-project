 Overview 
 DHIL derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation DHCM ). DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), and is the investment adviser and administrator for the Diamond Hill Funds (each a Fund, and collectively, the Funds ), a series of open-end mutual funds. DHCM also provides investment advisory and related services to the Diamond Hill Micro Cap Fund, LP DHMF ), a private fund, as well as, separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, model delivery programs and other pooled vehicles, including sub-advised funds. 
 The Company believes focusing on generating excellent, long-term investment outcomes and building enduring client partnerships will enable it to grow its intrinsic value to achieve a compelling, long-term return for its shareholders. 
 The Company accomplishes this through its shared investment principles, including: (i) valuation-disciplined active portfolio management, (ii) fundamental bottom-up research, (iii) a long-term, business-owner mindset, and (iv) a client alignment philosophy that ensures clients interests come first. Client alignment is emphasized through: (i) a strategic capacity discipline that protects portfolio managers abilities to generate excess returns, (ii) personal investment by portfolio managers in the strategies they manage, (iii) portfolio manager compensation being driven by long-term investment results in client portfolios, and (iv) a fee philosophy focused on a fair sharing of the economics among clients, employees, and shareholders. The Company s core cultural values of curiosity, ownership, trust, and respect create an environment where investment professionals focus on investment results and all teammates focus on the overall client experience. 
 
 The Company offers a variety of investment strategies designed for long-term strategic allocations from institutionally-oriented investors in key asset classes, aligning its investment team s competitive advantages with its clients needs. 
 Assets Under Management 
 DHCM s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned from managing client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size, and servicing requirements. DHCM s revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of its AUM. Accordingly, net cash flows from clients, market fluctuations, and the composition of AUM impact the Company's revenues and results of operations. The Company also has certain agreements that allow it to earn performance-based fees if investment returns exceed targeted amounts over a specified measurement period. 
 Model Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement 
 DHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by the program sponsors at a pre-determined rate based on assets under advisement AUA in the model delivery programs. DHCM does not have discretionary investment authority over individual client accounts in the model delivery programs, and therefore, the AUA are not included in the Company s AUM. 
 The following tables show AUM by product and investment objective, as well as net client cash flows, and AUA for each of the past five years ended December 31, 2022:

 Capacity 
 The Company s ability to retain and grow its AUM has been, and will continue to be, primarily driven by delivering attractive long-term investment results, which requires strict adherence to capacity discipline. If the Company determines the size of a strategy could impede its ability to meet investment return goals, the Company will close that strategy to new clients. The Company s commitment to capacity discipline inherently impacts its ability to grow its AUM. Investment results will always be prioritized over asset accumulation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s Large Cap and Small-Mid Cap strategies were closed to most new investors. The Company plans to reopen its Large Cap strategy on February 28, 2023. 
 Today, the Company s existing capacity is estimated to be 40 billion to 50 billion in domestic equities, 15 billion to 20 billion in international equities, and 50 billion to 65 billion in fixed income. The Company s firm level capacity increases with the development of new products or strategies. 
 Growth Strategy 
 As a deliberately capacity-constrained organization, the Company s growth centers first and foremost on delivering an investment and client experience that enables investors to experience better outcomes over the long-term. The Company s client alignment philosophy guides it to develop strategies and offer vehicles that meet clients objectives, capitalize on its investment team s research capabilities, and align with its investment principles. 
 The Company looks to attract like-minded, long-term focused clients across all of its offerings. In order to ensure efficient business development and relationship management, the Company has dedicated resources toward content-led marketing and sales enablement efforts. The Company believes that the combination of these efforts will lead to a deeper understanding of its investment strategies, and ultimately, longer holding periods for investors. 
 The Company focuses its efforts primarily on asset allocators with centralized research teams, allowing efficient delivery of services to a larger and more diverse client base. These tend to be highly sophisticated buyers, conducting deep research and pairing the Company s strategies with complementary strategies to meet holistic client objectives. These asset allocators include centralized research teams at institutional consulting firms, wirehouses, banks, independent broker dealers (IBD) and independent registered investment advisory firms (RIAs). The Company aims to partner with investors who maintain a long-term orientation and align with its investment principles.

 Fund Administration Activities 
 DHCM provides fund administration services to the Funds. Fund administration services are broadly defined to include the following services: portfolio and regulatory compliance; treasury and financial oversight; oversight of back-office service providers, such as the custodian, fund accountant, and transfer agent; and general business management and governance of the Funds. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the investment management industry is intense, and DHCM s competitors include investment management firms, broker-dealers, banks, and insurance companies, some of whom offer various investment alternatives, including passive index strategies. Many of DHCM s competitors are better known, offer a broader range of investment products, and have more dedicated resources for business development and marketing. 
 Regulation 
 DHCM s firm and business are subject to various federal, state, and non-U.S. laws and regulations. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets, and with protecting the interests of participants in those markets, including investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. If an adviser fails to comply with these laws and regulations, these regulatory bodies have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict, or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business. Possible sanctions that regulatory bodies may impose include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser, broker-dealer, and other registrations, censures, and fines.

 DHCM is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and operates in a highly regulated environment. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements, and disclosure obligations. All of the Funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), and are required to make notice filings with all states where the Funds are offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of DHCM s investment advisory and fund administration business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. 
 DHCM is a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), with respect to benefit plan clients, and therefore, is subject to ERISA regulations. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The U.S. Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, has been increasingly active in proposing and adopting regulations affecting the asset management industry. 
 DHCM s trading activities for client accounts are regulated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, which includes regulations governing trading on inside information, market manipulation, and a broad number of trading and market regulation requirements in the United States e.g. , volume limitations and reporting obligations). 
 The preceding descriptions of the regulatory and statutory provisions applicable to DHCM are not exhaustive or complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the respective statutory or regulatory provisions. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on DHCM s business. 
 Contractual Relationships with the Funds 
 DHCM is highly dependent on its contractual relationships with the Funds. If any of DHCM s advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were terminated or not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, DHCM would be materially and adversely affected. DHCM generated approximately 71 , 69 , and 75 of its 2022, 2021, and 2020 revenues, respectively, from its advisory and administration agreements with the Funds. DHCM believes that it has strong relationships with the Funds and their board of trustees, and DHCM has no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future. However, there is no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with DHCM. Please see Item 1A for risk factors regarding this relationship. 
 Human Capital 
 The Company believes its people are its greatest asset, and each role within the firm contributes to our goals of generating excellent, long-term investment outcomes and building enduring client partnerships.

 Employees who are curious focus on continuous self-improvement and have a passion for learning. They are open-minded, seek differing perspectives, and go beyond surface-level assumptions. Employees who think and act like business owners naturally embrace a long-term mindset. They lead by example and accept accountability for ensuring excellent client outcomes. Employees who embrace trust act with integrity, are authentic and honest in interactions with others, and put client interests ahead of all others. Employees who are motivated by giving and receiving respect communicate and provide feedback candidly, transparently, and with positive intent. They are humble in their assumptions and listen to better understand others. They embrace, value, and celebrate diversity, inclusion, and differences in all forms. 
 The Company s culture revolves around the fact that Diamond Hill is a fiduciary first and foremost. The primary focus is serving its clients and the Company believes this client-centric approach is difficult for competitors to replicate. The Company s long-term, valuation-disciplined investment principles are foundational to its culture and have been consistently implemented since the firm s inception. All members of the investment team believe in, and adhere to, the same investment principles. Our employees invest alongside our clients, and portfolio managers have significant personal investments in the strategy or strategies they manage. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 The Company views diversity, equity, and inclusion DEI as essential parts of its business and operating model. DEI is embedded in the policies, practices, and strategic initiatives of the Company, and is linked to its core values. The Company believes clients are best served by decision making that engages and encourages varied perspectives.

 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 The Company s future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources as well as the market price of its common stock, are subject to various risks, including those risks mentioned below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K as well as those risks that are discussed from time-to-time in the Company s other filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision regarding the Company s common shares. There may be additional risks of which the Company is currently unaware, or which the Company currently considers to be immaterial. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and the value of its common stock. Please see Forward Looking Statements within Part I, Item 1, of this Form 10-K. 
 Business Risks 
 Poor investment results or adverse ratings of the Company s products could affect its ability to attract new clients or could reduce its AUM, potentially negatively impacting revenue and net income. 
 If the Company fails to deliver acceptable investment results for its clients, both in the short and long-term, the Company could experience diminished investor interest and a decreased level of AUM. 
 Investment strategies are assessed and rated by independent third parties, including rating agencies, industry analysts, and publications. Investors can be influenced by such ratings. If a strategy receives an adverse report, it could negatively impact the Company s AUM and revenue. 
 The Company s success depends on its key personnel, and its financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services. 
 The Company s success depends on highly skilled personnel, including portfolio managers, research analysts, and management, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in the investment management industry. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and the Company faces significant competition for qualified employees. Other than the Company s Chief Executive Officer, its employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment at any time. The Company may not be able to retain or replace key personnel. In order to retain or replace its key personnel, the Company may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease its net income. The loss of key personnel could damage the Company s reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and clients. A loss of client assets resulting from the departure of key personnel may materially decrease the Company s revenues and net income. 
 The Company s investment results and/or growth in its AUM may be constrained if appropriate investment opportunities are not available or if the Company closes certain of its investment strategies to new investors. 
 The Company s ability to deliver strong investment results depends in large part on its ability to identify appropriate investment opportunities in which to invest client assets. If the Company is unable to identify sufficient investment opportunities for existing and new client assets on a timely basis, its investment results could be adversely affected. The risk that appropriate investment opportunities may be unavailable is influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, and is likely to increase if the Company s AUM increases rapidly. Our efforts to establish and develop new strategies may face challenges or ultimately be unsuccessful, which could impact our results of operations, our reputation and culture. In addition, if the Company determines that sufficient investment opportunities are not available for an investment strategy, or it believes that it is necessary to continue to produce attractive returns from an investment strategy, the Company will consider closing the investment strategy to new investors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has two investment strategies closed to new investors. If the Company misjudged the point at which it would be optimal to close an investment strategy, the investment results of the strategy could be negatively impacted. 
 The Company is subject to substantial competition in all aspects of its business. 
 The Company s investment products compete against investment products and services from: 
 Asset management firms; 
 Mutual fund companies; 
 Commercial banks and thrift institutions; 
 Insurance companies; 
 Exchange-traded funds; 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 Private funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds; and 
 Brokerage and investment banking firms. 
 Many of the Company s competitors have substantially greater resources and may operate in more markets or offer a broader range of products, including passively managed or index products. Some of these institutions operate in a different regulatory environment, which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. The Company competes with other providers of investment services primarily based upon its philosophy, performance, and client service. Some institutions have a broader array of products and distribution channels, which makes it more difficult for the Company to compete. If current or potential clients decide to use one of the Company s competitors, it could face a significant decline in market share, AUM, revenues, and net income. If the Company is required to lower its fees to remain competitive, its net income could be significantly reduced because some of the Company s expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and its expenses may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues. Additionally, over the past several years, investors have generally shown a preference for passive investment products over actively managed strategies. If this trend continues, the Company s AUM may be negatively impacted. 
 Market and competitive pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower management fees in the asset management industry and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its current fee structure. As a result, a shift in in the Company s AUM from higher to lower fee generating clients and strategies could result in a decrease in profitability even if its AUM increases or remains unchanged. 
 The loss of access to, or increased fees required by, third - party distribution sources to market the Company s portfolios and access its client base could adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 
 The Company s ability to attract additional AUM is dependent on its relationship with third-party financial intermediaries. The Company compensates some of these intermediaries for access to investors and for various marketing services provided. These distribution sources and client bases may not continue to be accessible to the Company for reasonable terms, or at all. If such access is restricted or eliminated, it could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. Fees paid to financial intermediaries for investor access and marketing services have generally increased in recent years. If such fee increases continue, refusal to pay them could restrict the Company's access to those client bases while paying them could adversely affect its profitability. 
 A significant portion of DHCM's revenues are based on advisory and administration agreements with the Funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice. 
 DHCM is highly dependent on its contractual relationships with the Funds. If DHCM's advisory or administration agreements with the Funds were terminated or not renewed, or were amended or modified to reduce fees, DHCM would be materially and adversely affected. Generally, these agreements are terminable by either party upon 60 days prior written notice without penalty. The Funds agreements are subject to annual approval by either: (i) the board of trustees of the Funds, or (ii) a vote of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund. These agreements automatically terminate in the event of their assignment by either DHCM or the Funds. DHCM generated approximately 71 , 69 , and 75 of its 2022, 2021, and 2020 revenues, respectively, from its advisory and administration agreements with the Funds, including 34 , 11 , and 10 from the advisory contracts with the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, and the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund, respectively, during 2022. The loss of any of the Diamond Hill Large Cap Fund, the Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund, or the Diamond Hill Small-Mid Cap Fund contracts would have a material adverse effect on DHCM. DHCM believes that it has strong relationships with the Funds and their boards of trustees, and it has no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with DHCM. 
 Negative public opinion of the Company could cause it to lose clients and adversely affect its stock price. 
 Negative public opinion can result from the Company s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including trading practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, DEI issues, social media and other marketing activities, and actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company s ability to attract and maintain clients, could expose the Company to potential litigation or regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on its stock price or result in heightened volatility. 
 Operational Risks 
 Cybersecurity attacks could prevent the Company from managing client portfolios, cause the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee information or result in misappropriation of information or funds, each of which could severely harm its business. 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 As part of its business, the Company collects, processes, and transmits sensitive and confidential information about its clients and employees, as well as proprietary information about its business. The Company has policies and procedures pursuant to which it takes numerous security measures to prevent cyberattacks of various kinds as well as fraudulent and inadvertent activity by persons who have been granted access to such confidential information. Nevertheless, the Company's systems, like all technology systems, remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, which can result in theft or corruption of information. In addition, the Company shares information with third parties upon whom it relies for various functions. The systems of such third parties also are vulnerable to cyber threats. Unauthorized access can come from unrelated third parties through the internet, from access to hardware removed from the Company's premises or those of third parties or from employees acting intentionally or inadvertently. 
 Cybersecurity incidents can involve, among other things: (i) deliberate attacks designed to corrupt the Company's information systems and make them unusable by the Company to operate its business; (ii) theft of information used by the perpetrators for financial and other gain; or (iii) inadvertent releases of information by employees or third parties with whom the Company does business. 
 Cyberattacks that corrupt the Company's information systems and make them unusable could impair its ability to trade securities in its clients accounts. Corruption of the systems of the Company's third-party vendors could impact the Company to the same extent as corruption of its own systems. If information about the Company's employees is intentionally stolen or inadvertently made public, that information could be used to commit identity theft, obtain credit in an employee s name, or steal from an employee. If information about the Company's business is obtained by unauthorized persons, whether through intentional attacks or inadvertent releases of information, it could be used to harm its competitive position. 
 Whether information is corrupted, stolen, or inadvertently disclosed, and regardless of the type and nature of the information e.g. , proprietary information about the Company's business or personal information about clients or employees), the results could be multiple and materially harmful to us, including the following: 
 The Company's reputation could be harmed, resulting in the loss of clients, vendors, and employees or making payments or concessions to such persons to maintain its relationships with them; 
 The Company's inability to operate its business fully, even if temporarily, and thus, fulfill contracts with clients or vendors, could result in termination of contracts and loss of revenue; 
 Harm suffered by clients or vendors whose contracts have been breached, or by clients, vendors, or employees whose information is compromised, could result in costly litigation against us; 
 The Company's need to focus attention on remediation of a cyber issue could take its attention away from the operation of its business, resulting in lost revenue; 
 The Company could incur costs to repair systems made inoperable by a cyberattack and to make changes to its systems to reduce future cyber threats. Those changes could include, among other things, obtaining additional technologies as well as employing additional personnel and training employees; 
 The interruption of the Company s business or theft of proprietary information could harm its ability to compete; and 
 Any losses that the Company may be responsible to bear may not be covered by insurance. 
 Any of the above potential impacts of a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The Company may not be able to adapt to technological change. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients while reducing costs. The Company's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address client needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. The Company may not be able to implement effectively new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect the Company s growth, revenue, and profit. 
 Operational risks may disrupt the Company s business, result in losses, or limit its growth.

Table of Contents 

 The Company is dependent on the capacity and reliability of the communications, information, and technology systems supporting its operations, whether developed, owned, or operated internally by the Company or by third parties. Operational risks, such as trading or operational errors, interruption of the Company s financial, accounting, trading, compliance, and other data processing systems, the loss of data contained in such systems, or compromised systems due to cyberattack, could result in a disruption of the Company s business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage, and thus, adversely affect its business. 
 Industry, Market, and Economic Risks 
 The Company's AUM, which impacts revenue, is subject to significant fluctuations. 
 The majority of the Company s revenue is calculated as a percentage of AUM or is related to the general performance of the equity securities markets. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products, or an increase in fund redemptions, generally will reduce revenue and net income. Financial market declines will generally negatively impact the level of the Company s AUM, and consequently, its revenue and net income. A recession or other economic or political events, whether in the United States or globally could also adversely impact the Company s revenue, if such events led to a decreased demand for products, a higher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices. Investor interest in the valuation of our fixed income strategies are affected by changes in interest rates and the overall credit environment. In addition, the majority of our existing AUM is managed in primarily long-only, equity investment strategies, which exposes us to greater risk than certain of our competitors who may manage assets in more diverse strategies. 
 The Company's investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions. 
 The Company's investment strategies are best suited for investors with long-term investment time horizons. The Company's investment strategies may not perform well during certain periods of time. Additionally, the Company could have common positions and industry concentrations across its strategies at the same time. As such, factors leading to underperformance may impact multiple strategies simultaneously. 
 The Company's investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in its investment portfolio. 
 The Company currently has a substantial portion of its assets invested in investment strategies that it manages. All of these investments are subject to market risk and the Company s non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by adverse market performance. Fluctuations in investment income are expected to occur in the future. 
 Trading in the Company s common shares is limited, which may adversely affect the time and the price at which shareholders can sell their shares. 
 Although the Company s common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the shares are held by a relatively small number of shareholders, and trading in its common shares is relatively inactive. The spread between the bid and the ask prices is often wide. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price. In addition, certain shareholders, including certain of the Company s directors and officers, own a significant number of shares. The sale of a large number of shares by any such individual could temporarily depress the market price of its shares. 
 Regulatory Risks 
 Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. 
 The Company is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions that the Company has taken or may implement changes in tax policy, which may result in the assessment of additional taxes on the Company. The Company regularly assesses the appropriateness of its tax positions and reporting. The Company cannot provide assurances, however, that tax authorities will agree with the positions it has taken, or that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable. 
 The Company's business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, which can change frequently and may increase costs of compliance, reduce revenue, result in fines, penalties, and lawsuits for noncompliance, and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Company's business is subject to a variety of federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In addition, the Company is subject to significant regulation and 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 oversight by the SEC. Changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements could have a significant effect on the Company s operations and results, including, but not limited to, increased expenses and reduced investor interest in certain funds and other investment products that the Company offers. The Company continually monitors legislative, tax, regulatory, accounting, and compliance developments that could impact its business. The Company and its directors, officers, and employees could be subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings for violations of such laws and regulations, which could result in the payment of fines or penalties and cause reputational harm to the Company, which could negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations, as well as divert management s attention from its operations. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The Company s insurance policies may not cover all losses and costs to which it may be exposed. 
 The Company carries insurance in amounts and under terms that it believes are appropriate. The Company s insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which it may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As the Company s insurance policies come up for renewal, it may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. 
 Natural disasters, global pandemics, and other unpredictable events could adversely affect the Company s operations. 
 Natural disasters, outbreaks of epidemics or pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other unpredictable events could adversely affect the Company s revenues, expenses, and net income by: 
 Decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that the Company manages and its corporate investments, thus, causing reductions in revenue; 
 Causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive; 
 Reducing the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company s business activities; 
 Interrupting the Company s business operations or those of critical service providers; 
 Triggering technology delays or failures; and 
 Requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to restore the Company s operations. 
 The Company has developed various backup systems and contingency plans but cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. The Company also relies to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and there is a risk that these vendors will not be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If the Company loses the availability of employees, or if it is unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, revenues, expenses, and net income could be negatively impacted. 
 Specifically, the effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) since early 2020 have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy, and the global financial markets, and may disrupt the Company s operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although the long-term effects of the current pandemic cannot currently be predicted, previous occurrences of other pandemic and epidemic diseases had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. A recurrence of an outbreak of any kind of epidemic, communicable disease or virus or major public health issue could cause a slowdown in the levels of economic activity generally, which would adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and operations.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following performance graph compares the total shareholder return of an investment in the Company s common shares to that of the Russell Microcap Index, the Russell 2000 Asset Managers Custodians Index (the R2000 A C Index ), and to a peer group index of publicly-traded asset management firms Peer Group for the five-year period ended on December 31, 2022. The graph assumes that the value of the investment in the Company s common shares and each index was 100 on December 31, 2017. Total return includes reinvestment of all dividends. The Russell Microcap Index makes up less than 3 of the U.S. equity market and is a market-value-weighted index of the smallest 1,000 securities in the small-cap Russell 2000 Index plus the next 1,000 smallest securities. The R2000 A C Index is comprised of the Asset Managers Custodians subsector of the Russell 2000 Index. Peer Group returns are weighted by the market capitalization of each firm at the beginning of the measurement period. Effective December 31, 2022, the Company has elected to replace the Russell Microcap Index and the Peer Group returns with the R2000 A C Index as it believes that index provides a broader comparison than the Peer Group. The historical information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The Company does not make or endorse any predictions as to future stock performance.

 Due to the relatively low trading volume of DHIL s shares, bid/ask spreads can be wide at times, and therefore, quoted prices may not be indicative of the price a shareholder may receive in an actual transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 2,472,866 and 2,635,186, of DHIL s common shares were traded, respectively. 
 In addition to the regular quarterly dividends, the Board will decide whether to approve and pay an additional special dividend in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Although DHIL currently expects to pay regular quarterly dividends, depending 
 on the circumstances and the Board s judgment, DHIL may not pay such dividends as described. 
 The approximate number of record holders of DHIL s common shares as of February 23, 2023 was 75. The approximate number of beneficial holders of DHIL s common stock held by brokers, banks, and other intermediaries was greater than 8,000 as of February 23, 2023.

 Business Environment 1 
 The performance of the U.S. and international equity markets, as well as the U.S. fixed income market, have a direct impact on the Company s operations and financial position. 2022 was a difficult operating environment for active investment managers. 
 A difficult market environment driven by high inflation and rising interest rates resulted in both U.S. equity and U.S. fixed income asset classes generating negative returns in 2022 (as represented by the S P 500 Index and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index). Across the industry, many investors withdrew their long-term investments leading to a combined 365 billion of outflows from U.S. mutual funds and exchange traded funds ETFs in 2022. This represents the worst year on record since Morningstar, Inc. began tracking the data in 1993, and was driven heavily by outflows from fixed income funds. In particular, U.S. actively managed taxable bond funds had 379 billion in outflows in 2022, a decline of 11 on an organic growth basis from prior period assets. 
 Investors contributed 50 billion to U.S. Equity funds in aggregate while also allocating away from growth funds as the Russell 3000 Growth Index underperformed the Russell 3000 Value Index for the first time since 2016. However, actively managed U.S. equity funds had meaningful outflows of 231 billion, compared to inflows of 281 billion for their passive counterparts. Despite these overall flow trends, actively managed U.S. equity funds with a five-star Morningstar Rating TM did have positive flows, a reminder that investors will continue to select the best performing actively managed investment strategies. 
 Active ETFs accounted for 15 of all ETF inflows in 2022 but represented just 5 of the 6.5 trillion in ETFs at the end of the year. The Company believes the increased inflows are attributable in part to newly launched active ETFs converted from mutual funds and to funds offering investors daily transparency of their portfolio holdings. ETFs do not allow managers to enforce any kind of capacity discipline on their offerings, which the Company believes is critical to protecting its ability to deliver excellent investment outcomes for clients. 
 The Company continues to pursue ways to partner with clients to deliver its intellectual property directly to them, including through model-delivery. These forms of delivery have an advantage over ETFs by enabling clients to further personalize portfolios to their unique preferences and tax situations. The Company continues to see companies invest in and deploy technology to offer customized portfolios at scale at their firms and believe this will be beneficial for end investors.

 Investment Results 
 It is imperative that the Company provide its clients with excellent investment returns over long periods of time. Investment results are the key driver of long-term success as well as the Company s ability to grow AUM. 
 The strategies offered by the Company have delivered what it believes to be strong long-term investment returns compared to its peers in the relevant Morningstar categories. Performance compared to a core benchmark, however, has been challenging over the past decade or more for valuation sensitive investors. 
 
 Below is a summary of the performance of the Diamond Hill Funds compared to their respective Morningstar categories and the Company s investment strategy composite returns compared to their respective benchmarks.

 Key Financial Performance Indicators 
 There are a variety of key performance indicators that the Company monitors to evaluate its business results. The following table presents the results of certain key performance indicators over the past three fiscal years: 
 For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Ending AUM (in millions) 24,763 31,028 26,411 Average AUM (in millions) 27,599 30,297 21,907 Net cash inflows (outflows) (in millions) (2,241) 2,123 1,529 Ending AUM and AUA (in millions) 26,565 33,126 27,510 Total revenue (in thousands) 154,496 182,194 126,388 Net operating income 64,331 76,258 45,538 Adjusted net operating income (a)

 (a) Adjusted net operating income, and adjusted operating profit margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation section in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for the definitions of GAAP and non-GAAP as well as a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Assets Under Management 
 The Company derives revenue primarily from DHCM's investment advisory and administration fees. Investment advisory and administration fees paid to DHCM are generally based on the value of the investment portfolios it manages and fluctuate with changes in the total value of its AUM. The Company, through DHCM, recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a client. 
 Model Delivery Programs - Assets Under Advisement 
 DHCM provides strategy-specific model portfolios to sponsors of model delivery programs. DHCM is paid for its services by the program sponsor at a pre-determined rate based on AUA in the model delivery programs. DHCM does not have discretionary investment authority over individual client accounts in model delivery programs, and therefore, the AUA are not included in the Company s AUM. 
 The Company s revenues are highly dependent on both the value and composition of AUM and AUA. The following is a summary of the Company s AUM by product and investment objective, a roll-forward of the change in AUM, and a summary of AUA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:

 2022 Discussion of Net Cash Outflows 
 Flows out of the Company s equity strategies were largely driven by its Large Cap strategy, which experienced net outflows of 1.9 billion. The Large Cap strategy was soft closed during 2022. The strategy will be fully reopened on February 28, 2023. The Company s Small-Mid Cap strategy remains soft closed to new investors. Net outflows from the Company s other equity strategies totaled approximately 0.3 billion. The Company s fixed income strategies saw mixed results with net flows of 0.3 billion into its Core Bond strategy offsetting outflows from its Short Duration Securitized Bond Fund of 0.2 billion. The Company has seen growth in its collective investment trust offerings. In addition to new clients, some larger plans moved from the Funds into the collective investment trusts. 
 
 2021 Discussion of Net Cash Inflows 
 Both the Company s equity and fixed income strategies experienced net inflows during 2021. Flows in the Company s equity strategies were largely driven by its Large Cap strategy, which experienced net inflows of 2.1 billion. These net inflows were partially offset by net outflows from the Company s other equity strategies totaling approximately 1.2 billion. The Company's fixed income strategies, including the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts prior to their sale, had net positive flows of 1.2 billion during 2021. 
 
 2020 Discussion of Net Cash Inflows 
 Flows into equity strategies were mixed in 2020. The Company s Large Cap and Mid-Cap strategies had combined net inflows of 1.6 billion. However, these net inflows were more than offset by the net outflows in the Long-Short, Small Cap and Small-Mid Cap strategies, which collectively had outflows of 1.8 billion. The Company s fixed income strategies continued to see strong growth in 2020 as each of the strategies met long-term performance objectives compared to peers and benchmarks. The Company s focused marketing and branding efforts, along with strong performance, led to combined fixed income net inflows of 1.8 billion, with each of the strategies attracting at least 200 million in net inflows.

 Summary Discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations - 2022 Compared to 2021 
 
 Revenue for 2022 decreased 27.7 million compared to 2021, primarily due to a 9 decrease in average AUM and 1.5 million in performance-based fees earned in 2022 compared to 11.9 million of performance-based fees in 2021. A significant performance-based agreement reached its first five-year measurement term on September 30, 2021. Since the initial five-year measurement period ended, the performance-based fee has been calculated annually based on the client investment results over the recently completed five-year period. The average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) remained unchanged at 0.52 year over year. 
 
 Operating profit margin was 42 for both 2022 and 2021 respectively. Adjusted operating profit margin was 39 for 2022 and 46 for 2021. Adjusted operating profit margin excludes the impact of market movements on the deferred compensation liability and related economic hedges, and the impact of the Diamond Hill International Fund and the Diamond Hill Large Cap Concentrated Fund (together, the Consolidated Funds ). See the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation" section below in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company expects that its operating margin will fluctuate from period-to-period based on various factors, including revenues, investment results in the strategies the Company manages, employee performance, staffing levels, and gains and losses on investments held in deferred compensation plans. 
 
 The Company had 20.2 million in investment losses due to market depreciation for 2022 compared to 16.4 million in investment income due to market appreciation for 2021. 
 
 The Company recorded a gain of 6.8 million from the final payment on the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts during 2022, and a gain of 9.0 million from the initial payment on the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts during 2021. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 12.0 million for 2022, compared to 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the Company s income before taxes, which was partially offset by an increase in its effective tax rate from 25.6 to 27.6 year-over-year. The increase in the Company s effective tax rate in 2022 was primarily due to the benefit attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. 
 
 The Company generated net income attributable to common shareholders of 40.4 million 13.01 per diluted share) for 2022, compared to 74.2 million 23.34 per diluted share) for 2021. The year-over-year decrease in net income attributable to 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 common shareholders was primarily due to the decline of revenues as a result of decreased AUM and the decrease in performance-based fees, as well as investment losses in 2022 compared to investment gains in 2021 due to the market environment. 
 
 Summary Discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations - 2021 Compared to 2020 
 
 Revenue for 2021 increased 55.8 million compared to 2020, primarily due to a 38 increase in average AUM and 11.9 million in performance-based fees earned in 2021 compared to 0.5 million of performance-based fees in 2020. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) from 0.54 to 0.52 year over year. 
 
 Operating profit margin was 42 for 2021 and 36 for 2020. Adjusted operating profit margin was 46 for 2021, and 38 for 2020. Adjusted operating profit margin excludes the impact of market movements on the deferred compensation liability and related economic hedges, and the impact of the Consolidated Funds. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation section below in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company expects that its operating margin will fluctuate from period to period based on various factors, including revenues, investment results, employee performance, staffing levels, gains and losses on investments held in deferred compensation plans, and the development of investment strategies, products, or channels. 
 
 The Company recognized 16.4 million in investment income for 2021 compared to 6.6 million for 2020. The year-over-year increase in investment income was due to a higher average investment balance throughout the year and higher returns on the investments. 
 
 The Company recorded a gain of 9.0 million related to the sale of its High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts in 2021. 
 
 Income tax expense increased 12.1 million for 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in the Company s income before taxes, which was partially offset by a decrease in its effective tax rate from 26.8 to 25.6 year-over-year. The decrease in the Company s effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to the benefit attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests, and a decrease in excess tax deficits from the vesting of restricted stock, which were partially offset by an increase in state and local taxes from the performance fees year-over-year. 
 
 The Company generated net income attributable to common shareholders of 74.2 million 23.34 per diluted share) for 2021 compared to 38.7 million 12.03 per diluted share) for 2020, primarily due to increased revenues, an increase in investment income, and the gain on the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts in 2021.

Revenue - 2022 Compared to 2021 
 Investment Advisory Fees . Investment advisory fees decreased by 25.8 million, or 15 , from 2021 to 2022. Investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the market value of client accounts at contractual fee rates, which vary by investment product. 
 The Company recognized 1.5 million of performance-based fees in 2022 compared to 11.9 million of performance-based fees recognized in 2021. A significant performance-based agreement reached the end of its first five-year measurement period on September 30, 2021. Since the initial five-year measurement period ended, the performance-based fee has been calculated annually based on the client investment results over the recently completed five-year period. 
 The remaining decrease in investment advisory fees was due to a decrease of 9 in average AUM year-over-year. The average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) was 0.52 for both 2022 and 2021.

 Mutual Fund Administration Fees . Mutual fund administration fees decreased 1.9 million, or 16 , from 2021 compared to 2022. Mutual fund administration fees include administration fees received from the Funds, which are calculated as a percentage of the Funds' average AUM. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of a 14 decrease in the Funds' average AUM from 2021 compared to 2022. 
 
 Revenue - 2021 Compared to 2020 
 Investment Advisory Fees . Investment advisory fees increased by 51.0 million, or 43 , from 2020 to 2021. Investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the market value of client accounts at contractual fee rates, which vary by investment product. The increase in investment advisory fees was due to an increase of 38 in average AUM, and 11.9 million in performance-based fees recognized in 2021 as a significant performance-based agreement reached its first five-year measurement term. The Company recognized 0.5 million of performance-based fees in 2020. 
 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average advisory fee rate (excluding performance-based fees) from 0.54 to 0.52 year-over-year. The decrease in average advisory fee rate was driven by an increase in the mix of assets held in lower fee rate strategies during 2021 compared to 2020. 
 For 2021, the average advisory fee rates for equity and fixed income strategies, excluding performance-based fees, were 0.54 and 0.39 , respectively. For 2020, the average advisory fee rates for equity and fixed income strategies were 0.57 and 0.40 , respectively. 
 Mutual Fund Administration Fees . Mutual fund administration fees increased 4.8 million, or 66 , from 2020 to 2021. Mutual fund administration fees include administration fees received from the Funds, which are calculated as a percentage of the Funds' average AUM. The increase was primarily due to a 36 increase in the Funds' average AUM from 2020 to 2021, and a reduction in administration fees paid on behalf of the Funds as a percentage of average Fund AUM year over year.

Expenses - 2022 Compared to 2021 
 Compensation and Related Costs, Excluding Deferred Compensation Expense (Benefit) . Employee compensation and benefits decreased by 3.1 million, or 4 , from 2021 compared to 2022. This decrease is due to a decrease in accrued incentive compensation of 6.2 million and a decrease in other compensation expense of 0.7 million, which was partially offset by an increase in restricted stock expense of 3.3 million related to restricted stock grants issued in February of 2022 under the Company s long-term incentive program, and an increase in salary and related benefits of 0.5 million. On average, the Company had 129 full-time equivalent employees in 2022 and 126 in 2021. Incentive compensation expense can fluctuate significantly period over period as the Company evaluates investment performance, individual performance, its own performance, and other factors. 
 Deferred Compensation Expense (Benefit) . Deferred compensation benefit was 4.4 million for 2022 compared to an expense of 7.1 million for 2021. 
 The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense (benefit) and is included in operating income. Deferred compensation expense (benefit) is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the consolidated statements of income, and thus, has no impact on net income attributable to the Company.

 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 3 , from 2021 compared to 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 0.7 million in consulting fees and 0.5 million of proxy solicitation fees related to the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts in 2021. That decrease was partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in investment research and related conference fees, a 0.1 million increase in insurance expense, and a 0.2 million increase in IT staffing, hardware, and software expenses. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.5 million, or 7 , from 2021 compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 0.9 million in payments made to third-party intermediaries related to the sale of the Funds on their platforms, and 0.2 million related to its distribution technology platform and related external data costs. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 0.6 million in sales-related travel expenses. 
 Mutual Fund Administration . Mutual fund administration expenses decreased by 0.3 million, or 8 , from 2021 compared to 2022. Mutual fund administration expenses consist of both variable and fixed expenses. The variable expenses are based on Fund AUM levels and the number of shareholder accounts. The decrease was due to a reduction in variable expenses as a result of the decrease in the Funds average AUM period over period. 
 
 Expenses - 2021 Compared to 2020 
 Compensation and Related Costs, Excluding Deferred Compensation Expense . Employee compensation and benefits increased by 15.3 million, or 26 , from 2020 to 2021. This increase was due to increases in incentive compensation of 9.7 million, salary and related benefits of 3.1 million, restricted stock expense of 1.8 million, and other compensation expense of 0.7 million. On average, the Company had 126 full-time equivalent employees for both 2021 and 2020. Incentive compensation expense can fluctuate significantly period over period as the Company evaluates investment performance, individual performance, its own performance, and other factors. 
 Deferred Compensation Expense . Deferred compensation expense was 7.1 million for 2021, compared to deferred compensation expense of 2.2 million for 2020, primarily due to an increase in market appreciation on the Company s deferred compensation investments period over period. 
 The gain on deferred compensation plan investments increases deferred compensation expense and is included in operating income. Deferred compensation expense is offset by an equal amount in investment income below net operating income on the consolidated statements of income statement, and thus, has no impact on net income attributable to the Company. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses increased by 3.0 million, or 27 , from 2020 to 2021. This increase was partially due to a non-recurring 1.1 million refund related to Ohio commercial activity tax, which was received in 2020 and reduced general and administrative expense. The Ohio commercial activity tax is a gross receipts tax, and therefore, is not included in income taxes. Other increases in 2021 include 0.7 million in consulting fees, 0.5 million of proxy solicitation fees related to the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts, a 0.4 million increase in IT staffing, hardware, and software expense, and a 0.3 million increase in depreciation expense. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses increased by 1.7 million, or 28 , from 2020 to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 0.7 million related to the Company s distribution technology platform and the related external data costs, 0.5 million for payments made to third-party intermediaries related to the sale of the Funds on their platforms, and a 0.5 million increase in advertising expenses. 
 Mutual Fund Administration . Mutual fund administration expenses increased by 0.2 million, or 7 , from 2020 to 2021. Mutual fund administration expense consists of both variable and fixed expenses. The variable expenses are based on Fund AUM levels and the number of shareholder accounts. The increase was due to an increase in variable expenses as a result of the increase in the average Fund AUM period over period.

Prior to the approval of the 2022 Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased shares under similar repurchase programs. 
 The authority to repurchase share may be exercised from time to time as market conditions warrant and is subject to regulatory constraints. The timing, amount, and other terms and conditions of any repurchases will be determined by management in its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of such shares, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation 
 As supplemental information, the Company is providing certain financial measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles non-GAAP ). Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures below are useful measures of the Company s core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and help facilitate comparisons to Company operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedules reconcile financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

 (1) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the deferred compensation plan liability and the related net gains/losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the deferred compensation plans are adjusted for appreciation/depreciation of investments chosen by participants. The Company believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income/loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help readers understand the Company s core operating results and to improves comparability from period to period. 
 (2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact that the Consolidated Funds have on the Company s GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the Company adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the Consolidated Funds. The adjustment to net operating income represents the operating expenses of the Consolidated Funds, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to common shareholders represents the net income of the Consolidated Funds, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company removes the impact of the Consolidated Funds because it believes they impact the reader s ability to understand its core operating results. 
 (3) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of the gain on the sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts. The sale of the High Yield-Focused Advisory Contracts was a nonrecurring transaction, thus, the Company believes that removing the impact of the gain helps readers understand the Company s core operating results and improves comparability period to period. 
 (4) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the net gains/losses earned on the Company s non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the deferred compensation plan liability, non-consolidated seed investments, and other investments. The Company believes adjusting for these non-operating income/loss items helps readers understand the Company s core operating results and improves comparability to prior years. 
 (5) The income tax expense impacts were calculated and resulted in an overall non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25.8 for 2022, 26.0 for 2021 and 26.5 for 2020. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates such estimates, judgments, and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and bases its estimates, judgements, and assumptions on historical experiences, current trends, and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
 
 Consolidation. The Company consolidates all subsidiaries and certain investments in which the Company has a controlling interest. The Company is generally deemed to have a controlling interest when it owns the majority of the voting interest of a voting rights entity VRE or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity VIE ). A VIE is an entity that lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities, or any entity whose equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. The Company s analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity s legal organization, equity 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 structure, the rights of the investment holders, the Company s ownership interest in the entity, and its contractual involvement with the entity. The Company continually reviews and reconsiders its VIE or VRE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to its ownership interest, or amendments to contract documents. 
 Provisions for Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns. 
 Revenue Recognition on Performance-Based Advisory Contracts. The Company has certain investment advisory contracts in which a portion of the fees are based on investment performance achieved in the respective client portfolio in excess of a specified hurdle rate. These fees are calculated based on client investment results over rolling five-year periods. The Company records performance-based fees at the end of the contract measurement period because the performance-based fees earned are constrained based on movements in the financial markets. 
 Revenue Recognition when Acting as an Agent vs. Principal. The Funds have selected and contractually engaged certain vendors to fulfill various services to benefit the Funds shareholders or to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Funds. These services include, among others, required fund shareholder mailings, registration services, and legal and audit services. DHCM, in fulfilling a portion of its role under the administration agreement with the Funds, acts as agent to pay these obligations of the Funds. Each vendor is independently responsible for fulfillment of the services it has been engaged to provide and negotiates fees and terms with the management and board of trustees of the Funds. The fee that the Funds pay to DHCM is reviewed annually by the Funds board of trustees and specifically considers the contractual expenses that DHCM pays on behalf of the Funds. As a result, DHCM is not involved in the delivery or pricing of these services and bears no risk related to these services. Revenue has been recorded net of these Fund expenses, as appropriate for this agency relationship. 

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company s revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of its AUM. Accordingly, declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact its investment advisory revenues and net income. 
 The Company invests in its investment strategies, which are market risk sensitive financial instruments. These investments have inherent market risk in the form of price risk; that is, the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in their fair value. Market prices fluctuate, and the amount realized upon subsequent sale may differ significantly from the reported market value. 
 The table below summarizes the Company s market risks as of December 31, 2022, and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10 increase and decrease in investments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Evaluation of the assets under management data used in the calculation of investment advisory fee revenue for separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes investment advisory revenue for its separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles based on a percentage of its assets under management (AUM). The Company recognized 39.5 million in investment advisory fees related to separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles during the year ended December 31, 2022. AUM is an input to the calculation of the investment advisory fee revenue. Specifically, as it pertains to these accounts, the inputs to the AUM calculation and the calculated AUM value are transmitted through multiple information technology (IT) systems used in the calculation of investment advisory fee revenue. 
 
 39 

We identified the evaluation of the AUM data used in the calculation of separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts and other pooled vehicles investment advisory fee revenue as a critical audit matter. There is a high degree of auditor judgment required to perform procedures to address the Company s use of multiple IT systems to maintain the AUM data, including the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to test the AUM data processed through multiple IT systems. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the inputs to the AUM calculation, as well as controls that reconcile AUM between IT systems. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the testing of application and related general IT controls relevant to the IT systems used to maintain AUM data. We compared AUM used in the calculation of investment advisory fees to the source IT systems for a selection of accounts.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2012.

 (a) The provision for income taxes includes expense (benefit) attributable to the fact that the Company s operations include the Consolidated Funds, which are not subject to federal income taxes. Accordingly, a portion of the Company s earnings are not subject to corporate tax levels. 
 Deferred income taxes and benefits arise from temporary differences between taxable income for financial statement and income tax return purposes.

 The net temporary differences incurred to date will reverse in future periods as the Company generates taxable earnings. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded. The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2022, valuation allowance was deemed necessary. 
 FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes tax benefits related to positions taken, or expected to be taken, on its tax returns, only if the positions are more-likely-than-not sustainable. Once this threshold has been met, the Company s measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized in its financial statements. The Company did not record an accrual for tax-related uncertainties or unrecognized tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not expect a change to the reserve for uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the Company s 2022 and 2021 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K and the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, and has issued its Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Form 10-K. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making may be faulty and breakdowns may occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not

 absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all errors or fraud. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
