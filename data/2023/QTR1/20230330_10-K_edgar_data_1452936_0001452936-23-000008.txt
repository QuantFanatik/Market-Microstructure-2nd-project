FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as may, will, seeks, anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, plans, intends, should or similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
 We depend on our advisor to conduct our operations and eventually dispose of our investments. 
 We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our property investments could decrease due to a reduction in tenants (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our opportunistic investment strategy involves a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in some other types of real estate and real estate-related investments. 
 We have paid distributions from financings and in the future we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales, we will have less funds available for investment in loans, properties and other assets, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
 All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and other Pacific Oak-affiliated entities. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our former or current advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other Pacific Oak-advised programs and investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions. Fees paid to our advisor in connection with transactions involving the origination, acquisition and management of our investments are based on the cost of the investment, not on the quality of the investment or services rendered to us. This arrangement could influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. 
 We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates. These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase our stockholders risk of loss. 
 We cannot predict with any certainty how much, if any, of our dividend reinvestment plan proceeds will be available for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the redemption of shares under our share redemption program, future funding obligations under any real estate loans receivable we acquire, the funding of capital expenditures on our real estate investments or the repayment of debt. If such funds are not available from the dividend reinvestment plan offering, then we may have to use a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations to meet these cash requirements, which would reduce cash available for distributions and could limit our ability to redeem shares under our share redemption program. 
 We have focused, and may continue to focus, our investments in non-performing real estate and real estate-related loans, real estate-related loans secured by non-stabilized assets and real estate-related securities, which involve more risk than investments in performing real estate and real estate-related assets. 
 All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in shares of our common stock involves significant risks, See Risk Factors beginning on page 8. These risks include, among others: 
 Because no public trading market for our shares currently exists, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares. 
 We depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments and, accordingly, the revenue generated by our real estate investments is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy, including market rental rates, commercial real estate values, and our ability to secure debt financing and service debt obligations, and generate returns to stockholders. In addition, our real estate investments may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions, which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders. 
 A concentration of our real estate investments in any one property class may leave our profitability vulnerable to a downturn in such sector. 
 Because of the concentration of a significant portion of our assets in two geographic areas, any adverse economic, real estate or business conditions in these areas could affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Elevated market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions (such as the war in Ukraine), health crises or dislocations in the credit markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions. 
 Inflation and increased interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have no employees and are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations, to identify investments, to manage our investments and for the disposition of our properties. If our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC, faces challenges in performing its obligations to us, it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 
 All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals of our advisor are also officers, affiliated directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and/or other Pacific Oak-affiliated entities. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including but not limited to, conflicts arising from time constraints and allocation of investment opportunities. 
 Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs or Pacific Oak-advised investors, our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders. 
 We cannot guarantee that we will make distributions. Our distribution policy is not to use the proceeds of our offerings to make distributions. However, our charter permits us to pay distributions from any source, including offering proceeds or borrowings (which may constitute a return of capital), and our charter does not limit the amount of funds we may use from any source to pay such distributions. From time to time, we may use proceeds from third party financings to fund at least a portion of distributions in anticipation of cash flow to be received in later periods. We may also fund such distributions from the sale of assets. If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced. 
 Our policies do not limit us from incurring debt until our aggregate borrowings would exceed 300 of our net assets, which approximates aggregate liabilities of 75 of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves), and we may exceed this limit with the approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors. To the extent financing in excess of this limit is available on attractive terms, our conflicts committee may approve debt such that our total liabilities would exceed this limit. High debt levels could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of an investment in us. 
 There are limits on the ownership and transferability of our shares. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT and no relief provisions apply, our cash available for distribution to our stockholders could materially decrease.

PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. was formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intends to operate in such manner. As used herein, the terms we, our and us refer to Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and as required by context, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on December 10, 2008 (the Operating Partnership ), and its subsidiaries. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC Pacific Oak Capital Advisors is our advisor and as our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of investments. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors also has the authority to make all of the decisions regarding our investments, except for our residential homes portfolio. Our residential homes portfolio, held through our subsidiary Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc. PORT ), is managed by an affiliate of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors. The advisory duties are subject to the limitations in our charter and the direction and oversight of our board of directors. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. We have sought to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. 
 On January 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of 140,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 100,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 40,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on November 14, 2012. We sold 56,584,976 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of 561.7 million. Although we offered shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan through March 28, 2023, no shares were issued under the dividend reinvestment plan in 2021 or 2022 and we indefinitely suspended the plan as of March 28, 2023 to minimize administrative costs. On October 5, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT II ("POSOR II") merged with an indirect subsidiary of ours (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of POSOR II s common stock converted into 0.9643 shares of our common stock or 28,973,906 shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had sold 6,851,969 shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of 76.5 million. Also as of December 31, 2022, we had redeemed 27,951,857 of the shares sold in our offering for 324.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had issued 36,398,447 shares of common stock in connection with special dividends. Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, we issued 220,994 shares and 55,249 shares of common stock, respectively, for 2.0 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 On March 2, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI ), our wholly owned subsidiary, filed a final prospectus with the Israel Securities Authority for a proposed offering of up to 1,000,000,000 Israeli new Shekels of Series A debentures (the Series A Debentures at an annual interest rate not to exceed 4.25 . On March 1, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the institutional tender of the Series A Debentures and accepted application for 842.5 million Israeli new Shekels. On March 7, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the public tender of the Series A Debentures and accepted 127.7 million Israeli new Shekels. In the aggregate, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI accepted 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 249.2 million as of March 8, 2016) in both the institutional and public tenders at an annual interest rate of 4.25 . Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued the Series A Debentures on March 8, 2016. The terms of the Series A Debentures required five equal principal installment payments annually on March 1st of each year from 2019 to 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI completed the early pay off of all Series A Debentures. 
 On February 16, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued 254.1 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 74.1 million as of February 16, 2020) of Series B debentures (the Series B Debentures to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering registered with the Israel Securities Authority. The Series B Debentures bear interest at the rate of 3.93 per year. The Series B Debentures have principal installment payments equal to 33.33 of the face amount of the Series B Debentures on January 31st of each year from 2024 to 2026. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued additional Series B Debentures subsequent to the initial issuance and as of December 31, 2022, 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels (approximately 331.2 million as December 31, 2022) were outstanding. The additional Series B Debentures have an equal level of security, pari passu, amongst themselves and between them and the initial Series B Debentures, which were initially issued, without any right of precedence or preference between any of them.

As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, two apartment properties, one hotel property, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,456 residential homes, two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 742 developable acres, one office/retail development property and owned three investments in unconsolidated entities and three investments in real estate equity securities. 
 Objectives and Strategies 
 Our primary investment objectives are: 
 to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable returns; and 
 to preserve and return our stockholders capital contributions. 
 We have sought to achieve these objectives by investing in and managing a portfolio of opportunistic real estate, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments. We acquired our investments through a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering, debt financing and proceeds from the Series A Debenture and Series B Debenture offerings. We plan to lease-up and stabilize existing assets. We plan to explore value-add opportunities for existing assets and seek to realize growth in the value of our investments by timing asset sales to maximize their value. We also intend to actively pursue additional lending and investment opportunities that we believe will provide an attractive risk-adjusted return to our stockholders. 
 Real Estate Investments 
 As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2022, these properties were 69 occupied. In addition, we consolidated one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,456 residential homes and encompassing approximately 3.5 million rental square feet and two apartment properties containing 609 units and encompassing approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet, which were 94 and 95 occupied, respectively as of December 31, 2022. We also consolidated one hotel property with an aggregate of 196 rooms, two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 742 developable acres, one office/retail development property and three investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 We have attempted to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2022, we had no tenants that represented more than 10 of our total annualized base rent and our top ten tenants represented approximately 5 of our total annualized base rent. As of December 31, 2022, there were no properties classified as held for sale. For more information about our real estate investments, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Real Estate-Related Investments 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned three investments in real estate equity securities with a total book value of 60.2 million. 
 Financing Objectives 
 We have financed the majority of our real estate and real estate-related investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to potentially increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 5.2 . 
 We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of December 31, 2022, we had 564.7 million and 501.4 million of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 was 4.1 and 6.6 , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2022, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2022, where applicable. As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into three separate interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 176.5 million which effectively limits our exposure to increases in one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR and Secured Overnight Finance Rate SOFR above certain thresholds. 
 On February 16, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued 254.1 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 74.1 million as of February 16, 2020) of Series B Debentures to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering registered with the Israel Securities Authority. The Series B Debentures bear interest at the rate of 3.93 per year. The Series B Debentures have principal installment payments equal to 33.33 of the face amount of the Series B Debentures on January 31st of each year from 2024 to 2026. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued additional Series B Debentures subsequent to the initial issuance and as of December 31, 2022, 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels (approximately 331.2 million as December 31, 2022) were outstanding. The additional Series B Debentures have an equal level of security, pari passu, amongst themselves and between them and the initial Series B Debentures, which were initially issued, without any right of precedence or preference between any of them.

We have tried to spread the maturity dates of our debt to minimize maturity and refinance risk in our portfolio. In addition, a majority of our debt allows us to extend the maturity dates, subject to certain conditions. Although we believe we will satisfy the conditions to extend the maturity of our debt obligations, we can give no assurance in this regard. The following table shows the current and fully extended maturities, including principal amortization payments, of our debt as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): Current Maturity Extended Maturity 2023 412,338 273,396 2024 128,366 249,345 2025 250,779 161,708 2026 274,629 274,629 2027 53,758 Thereafter 53,276 1,066,112 1,066,112 
 There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment. Our charter limits our total liabilities to 75 of the cost of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2022, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 70 of the cost (before depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 
 We do not intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. High levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors, and could also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. High levels of debt could also increase the risk of being unable to refinance when loans become due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms, and the risk of loss with respect to assets pledged as collateral for loans. 
 Except with respect to the borrowing limits contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our debt policy in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, any investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to book value in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. 
 Disposition Policies 
 The period that we will hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates and other factors. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each investment we have made and will continually perform a hold-sell analysis on each asset in order to determine the optimal time to hold the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two office buildings, one hotel and approximately 67 acres of developable land. There were no properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022. The disposition strategy is consistent with our objectives of acquiring opportunistic investments, improving the investments and timing asset sales to realize the growth in the value that was created during our hold period. 
 Economic Dependency 
 We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, origination, acquisition and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide the respective services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.

Competitive Market Factors 
 The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We may also face competition from other entities that are selling assets. Competition from these entities may increase the supply of real estate investment opportunities or increase the bargaining power of real estate investors seeking to buy. 
 Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively. 
 Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 All of our real estate properties, other than properties acquired through foreclosure, were subject to Phase I environmental assessments at the time they were acquired. Some of the properties we have acquired are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Segments 
 We operate in three reportable business segments: strategic opportunistic properties and real estate-related investments, residential homes, and hotel, which is how our management manages the business. In general, we intend to hold our investments in opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, our management views opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments and aggregated into one reportable business segment. We own residential homes in 18 markets and are all aggregated into one reportable business segment due to the homes being stabilized, having high occupancy rates and have similar economic characteristics. Additionally, we own one hotel and are represented into one reportable business segment due to the nature of the hotel business with short-term stays.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. 
 Risks Related to an Investment in Us 
 Because no public trading market for our shares currently exists, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares and, if they are able to sell their shares, it will likely be at a substantial discount to the public offering price. 
 Our charter does not require our directors to seek stockholder approval to liquidate our assets by a specified date, nor does our charter require our directors to list our shares for trading on a national securities exchange by a specified date. There is no public market for our shares and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange. Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards. In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8 of our stock, unless exempted by our board of directors, which may inhibit large investors from purchasing our shares. In its sole discretion, our board of directors could amend, suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon ten business days notice. Further, the share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that would limit a stockholder s ability to sell his or her shares. Therefore, it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares promptly or at all. It is also likely that our shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan. Because of the illiquid nature of our shares, our stockholders should be prepared to hold our shares for an indefinite period of time. 
 If we are unable to find suitable investments, we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions. 
 Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions depends upon the performance of our advisor, in the acquisition of our investments, including the determination of any financing arrangements, and the ability of our advisor to source loan origination opportunities for us. Competition from competing entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of counterparties in transactions. We will also depend upon the performance of third-party loan servicers and property managers in connection with managing our investments. Stockholders must rely entirely on the management abilities of our advisor, the loan servicers and property managers our advisor selects and the oversight of our board of directors. We can give our stockholders no assurance that our advisor will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that, if our advisor makes investments on our behalf, our objectives will be achieved. In the event we are unable to timely locate suitable investments, we may be unable or limited in our ability to pay distributions and we may not be able to meet our investment objectives. 
 A concentration of our real estate investments in any one property class may leave our profitability vulnerable to a downturn in such sector. 
 Our investments are primarily categorized into three segments: strategic opportunistic real estate and related investments, residential homes and hotel. As a result, we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in limited types of properties. If our investments are substantially in limited property classes, then the potential effects on our revenues, and as a result, on cash available for distribution to our stockholders, resulting from a downturn in the businesses conducted in those types of properties could be more pronounced than if we had more fully diversified our investments. As of December 31, 2022, our investments in strategic opportunistic real estate and related investments, our residential homes and hotel segments represented 79.4 , 17.3 and 3.3 of our total assets, respectively.

Because of the concentration of a significant portion of our assets in two geographic areas, any adverse economic, real estate or business conditions in these areas could affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our real estate held for investment in California and Georgia represented 21.7 and 10.0 of our total assets, respectively. As a result, the geographic concentration of our portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the California and Georgia real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect market rental rates, commercial real estate values and our ability to secure debt financing, service debt obligations, or pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 Currently, both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive. While there has been an increase in the amount of capital flowing into the U.S. real estate markets, which resulted in an increase in real estate values in certain markets, the uncertainty regarding the economic environment has made businesses reluctant to make long-term commitments or changes in their business plans. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows. 
 We have relied on debt financing to finance our real estate properties and we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness and we also may be unable to obtain additional debt financing on attractive terms or at all. If we are not able to refinance our existing indebtedness on attractive terms at the various maturity dates, we may be forced to dispose of some of our assets. Market conditions can change quickly, which could negatively impact the value of our assets. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets and continued uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect the values of our investments. It remains uncertain whether the capital markets can sustain the current transaction levels. Any disruption to the debt and capital markets could result in fewer buyers seeking to acquire commercial properties and possible increases in capitalization rates and lower property values. Furthermore, declining economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing our loan investments, which could have the following negative effects on us: 
 the values of our investments in commercial properties could decrease below the amounts paid for such investments; 
 the value of collateral securing any loan investments we may make could decrease below the outstanding principal amount of such loans; and/or 
 revenues from our properties could decrease due to fewer tenants and/or lower rental rates, making it more difficult for us to pay distributions or meet our debt service obligations on debt financing. 
 All of these factors could impair our ability to make distributions to our investors and decrease the value of an investment in us. 
 Elevated market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions (such as the war in Ukraine), health crises or dislocations in the credit markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. office market as a whole and/or the local economies in the markets in which our properties are located. Such adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may be due to, among other issues, increased labor market challenges impacting the recruitment and retention of employees, rising inflation and interest rates, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic and other conditions, including pandemics, geopolitical instability (such as the war in Ukraine), sanctions and other conditions beyond our control. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions as a result of one or more of the following, among other potential consequences: 
 the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or for other reasons; 
 potential changes in customer behavior, such as the continued social acceptance, desirability and perceived economic benefits of work-from-home arrangements, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially and negatively impact the future demand for office space, resulting in slower overall leasing and an adverse impact to our operations and the valuation of our investments; 
 9 

significant job losses may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to refinance existing debt and increase our future interest expense; 
 reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; 
 the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors; and 
 to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments. 
 Inflation and increased interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, inflation reached a 40-year high in 2022 and beginning in March of 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising the federal funds rate in an effort to curb inflation. The Federal Reserve s action, coupled with other macroeconomic factors, may trigger a recession in the United States, globally, or both. Increased inflation and interest rates could have an adverse impact on our variable rate debt, our ability to borrow money, and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental and other revenue. Increases in the costs of owning and operating our properties due to inflation could reduce our net operating income and the value of an investment in us to the extent such increases are not reimbursed or paid by our tenants. If we are materially impacted by increasing inflation because, for example, inflationary increases in costs are not sufficiently offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense reimbursement provisions or escalations in the leases with our tenants, we may implement measures to conserve cash or preserve liquidity. Such measures could include reducing or suspending the number of shares redeemed under our share redemption program and reducing or suspending distributions we make to our stockholders. In addition, due to rising interest rates, we may experience restrictions in our liquidity based on certain financial covenant requirements, our inability to refinance maturing debt in part or in full as it comes due and higher debt service costs and reduced yields relative to cost of debt. If we are unable to find alternative credit arrangements or other funding in a high interest environment, our business needs may not be adequately met. 
 In addition, tenants and potential tenants of our properties may be adversely impacted by inflation and rising interest rates, which could negatively impact our tenants ability to pay rent and the demand for our properties. Such adverse impacts on our tenants may cause increased vacancies, which may add pressure to lower rents and increase our expenditures for re-leasing. 
 Uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms, or at all, which could reduce the number of properties we may be able to acquire and the amount of cash distributions we can make to our stockholders. 
 The U.S. and global credit markets have in the past experienced severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which caused volatility in the credit spreads on prospective debt financings and constrained the availability of debt financing due to the reluctance of lenders to offer financing at high leverage ratios. Similar conditions in the future could adversely impact our ability to access additional debt financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may adversely affect investment returns on future acquisitions or our ability to make acquisitions. 
 If mortgage debt or unsecured debt is unavailable on reasonable terms as a result of increased interest rates, increased credit spreads, decreased liquidity or other factors, we may not be able to finance the initial purchase of properties. In addition, when we incur mortgage debt or unsecured debt, we run the risk of being unable to refinance such debt upon maturity, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. 
 If interest rates are higher or other financing terms, such as principal amortization, the need for a corporate guaranty, or other terms are not as favorable when we refinance debt or issue new debt, our income could be reduced. To the extent we are unable to refinance debt on reasonable terms, at appropriate times or at all, we may be required to sell properties on terms that are not advantageous to us, or that could result in the foreclosure of such properties. If any of these events occur, our cash flow could be reduced. This, in turn, could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing securities or borrowing more money. 
 Because we depend upon our advisor and its affiliates to select, acquire, manage and dispose of our real estate investments and to conduct our operations, any adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor or its affiliates or our relationship with them could cause our operations to suffer. 
 10 

We depend on our advisor and its affiliates to select, acquire, manage and dispose of our real estate investments and to conduct our operations. Our advisor and its affiliates depend upon the fees and other compensation that it receives from us and other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs that they advise in connection with the purchase, management and sale of assets to conduct their operations. Any adverse changes to our relationship with, or the financial condition of, our advisor and its affiliates could hinder their ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments. 
 If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investments and the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced. 
 We will declare distributions when our board of directors determines we have sufficient cash flow from operations, investment activities and/or strategic financings. We expect to fund distributions from interest and rental income on investments, the maturity, payoff or settlement of those investments and from strategic sales of loans, properties and other assets. We may also fund distributions from debt financings. 
 As a REIT, we will generally have to hold our assets for two years for the production of real estate income in order to meet the safe harbor to avoid a 100 prohibited transactions tax, unless such assets are held through a TRS or other taxable corporation. At such time as we have assets that we have held for at least two years, we anticipate that we may authorize and declare distributions based on gains on asset sales, to the extent we close on the sale of one or more assets and the board of directors does not determine to reinvest the proceeds of such sales. Additionally, our board of directors intends to declare distributions quarterly based on cash flow from our investments. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP )). If we meet the REIT qualification requirements, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the income that we distribute to our stockholders each year. In general, we anticipate making distributions to our stockholders of at least 100 of our REIT taxable income so that none of our income is subject to federal income tax. Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. 
 Our distribution policy is not to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings. However, our organizational documents do not restrict us from paying distributions from any source and do not restrict the amount of distributions we may pay from any source, including proceeds from the issuance of securities, borrowings, advances from our advisor or sponsors or from our advisor s deferral of its fees under the advisory agreement. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits may constitute a return of capital. From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our taxable income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. In these situations, we may make distributions in excess of our cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement described above. In such an event, we would look first to other third-party borrowings to fund these distributions. If we fund distributions from financings, the proceeds from issuances of securities or sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investment in real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments and the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced. 
 In addition, to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations and gains realized from the dispositions of properties, a stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced and, to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder s basis, the stockholder may recognize capital gain. There is no limit on the amount of distributions we may fund from sources other than from cash flows from operations or gains realized from the dispositions of properties. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, we paid aggregate distributions of 0.6 million (of which 0.3 million was reinvested through our dividend reinvestment plan) and 11.0 million, respectively. There were no distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. Our cash flow used in operations and net loss attributable to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 1.8 million and 49.0 million, respectively. Our cash flow provided by operations and net loss attributable to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 16.0 million and 11.0 million, respectively. Our cash flow provided by operations and net loss attributable to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 10.9 million and 43.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, we funded 100 of total distributions paid, which includes cash distributions and dividends reinvested by stockholders, with prior period cash flow from operating activities in excess of distributions paid and cash from gains realized from the disposition of properties. From inception through December 31, 2022, we funded 9 of total distributions paid, which includes cash distributions and dividends reinvested by stockholders, with proceeds from debt financing, funded 46 of total distributions paid with the gains realized from the dispositions of properties and funded 45 of total distributions paid with cash provided by operations. Our cumulative distributions paid and net loss attributable to common stockholders from inception through December 31, 2022 was 495.8 million.

The loss of or the inability to retain or obtain key real estate and debt finance professionals at our advisor and its affiliates could delay or hinder implementation of our investment, management and disposition strategies, which could limit our ability to pay distributions and decrease the value of an investment in our shares. 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of Messrs. Hall and McMillan and the team of real estate and debt finance professionals at our advisor and its affiliates. Neither we nor our advisor or its affiliates have employment agreements with these individuals, and they may not remain associated with us, our advisor or its affiliates. If any of these persons were to cease their association with us, our advisor or its affiliates, we may be unable to find suitable replacements and our operating results could suffer as a result. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any person. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our advisor s and its affiliates ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense, and our advisor and its affiliates may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining such skilled professionals. Further, we have established strategic relationships with firms that have special expertise in certain services or detailed knowledge regarding real properties in certain geographic regions. Maintaining such relationships will be important for us to effectively compete in such regions. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining such relationships. If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of highly skilled professionals or do not establish or maintain appropriate strategic relationships, our ability to implement our investment, management and disposition strategies could be delayed or hindered and the value of our stockholders investment in us could decline. 
 The termination or replacement of our advisor could trigger a repayment event under our mortgage loans for some of our properties and the credit agreement governing any line of credit we obtain. 
 Lenders for certain of our properties may request provisions in the mortgage loan documentation that would make the termination or replacement of the advisor an event requiring the immediate repayment of the full outstanding balance of the loan. Similarly, under any line of credit we obtain, the termination or replacement of the advisor could trigger repayment of outstanding amounts under the credit agreement governing our line of credit. If a repayment event occurs with respect to any of our properties, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our independent directors are limited, which could reduce our stockholders and our recovery against our independent directors if they negligently cause us to incur losses. 
 Maryland law provides that a director has no liability in that capacity if he performs his duties in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Our charter provides that no independent director shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and that we will generally indemnify them for losses unless they are grossly negligent or engage in willful misconduct. As a result, our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our independent directors than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce our stockholders and our recovery from these persons if they act in a negligent manner. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our independent directors (as well as by our other directors, officers, employees (if we ever have employees) and agents) in some cases, which would decrease the cash otherwise available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 We may change our targeted investments without stockholder consent. 
 We may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in us making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, our targeted investments as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, we modified our investment objectives and criteria in January 2012 and we may do so again in the future. A change in our targeted investments or investment guidelines may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, all of which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. 
 A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could: 
 disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations; 
 result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; 
 result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT; 
 result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; 
 require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; 
 subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or 
 damage our reputation among our stockholders. 
 Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Our bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
 Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders with respect to our company, our directors, our officers or our employees (we note we currently have no employees). This exclusive forum provision does not apply to claims under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage meritorious claims from being asserted against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We adopted this provision because we believe it makes it less likely that we will be forced to incur the expense of defending duplicative actions in multiple forums and less likely that plaintiffs attorneys will be able to employ such litigation to coerce us into otherwise unjustified settlements, and we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce this provision is remote, as the General Assembly of Maryland has specifically amended the Maryland General Corporation Law to authorize the adoption of such provisions.

Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest 
 Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals, face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us, which could result in actions that are not in the long-term best interests of our stockholders. 
 All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Markets LLC Pacific Oak Capital Markets and other affiliated Pacific Oak entities. Our advisor and its affiliates receive substantial fees from us. These fees could influence our advisor s advice to us as well as the judgment of affiliates of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors. Among other matters, these compensation arrangements could affect their judgment with respect to: 
 the continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with our advisor and its affiliates, including the advisory agreement; 
 public offerings of equity by us, which may entitle Pacific Oak Capital Markets to dealer-manager fees and may entitle our advisor to asset management fees and certain other fees; 
 sales of investments, which may entitle our advisor to disposition fees and possible subordinated incentive fees; 
 acquisitions of investments and originations of loans, which may entitle our advisor to acquisition and origination fees and asset management fees and, in the case of acquisitions of investments from other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs, might entitle affiliates of our advisor to disposition fees and possible subordinated incentive fees in connection with its services for the seller; 
 borrowings to acquire investments and to originate loans, which borrowings may increase the acquisition and origination fees and asset management fees payable to our advisor; 
 whether to engage our advisor, which may receive fees in connection with the management of our properties regardless of the quality of the services provided to us, to manage our properties; and 
 whether we pursue a liquidity event such as a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, a sale of the company or a liquidation of our assets, which (i) may make it more likely for us to become self-managed or internalize our management, (ii) could positively or negatively affect the sales efforts for other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs, depending on the price at which our shares trade or the consideration received by our stockholders, and/or (iii) affect the advisory fees received by our advisor. 
 The fees our advisor may receive in connection with the acquisition, origination or management of assets are based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us. This may influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. 
 Pacific Oak Capital Advisors faces conflicts of interest relating to the leasing of properties and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we may obtain less credit-worthy or desirable tenants, which could limit our ability to make distributions and reduce our stockholders overall investment return. 
 We and other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors rely on our sponsors and other key real estate professionals at our advisor, including Messrs. Hall and McMillan, to supervise the property management and leasing of properties. If the Pacific Oak team of real estate professionals directs credit-worthy prospective tenants to properties owned by another Pacific Oak-sponsored program or Pacific Oak-advised investor when they could direct such tenants to our properties, our tenant base may have more inherent risk and our properties occupancy may be lower than might otherwise be the case. 
 Further, Messrs. Hall and McMillan and existing and future Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors are generally not prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business or from possessing interests in any other business venture or ventures, including businesses and ventures involved in the acquisition, development, ownership, leasing or sale of real estate investments. 
 
 14 

Our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the acquisition of assets, the leasing of properties and the disposition of properties due to their relationship with other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and/or Pacific Oak-advised investors, which could result in decisions that are not in our best interest or the best interests of our stockholders. 
 We rely on the key real estate and debt finance professionals of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and Pacific Oak Residential Advisors, including Messrs. Hall and McMillan, to identify suitable investments. Messrs. Hall and McMillan and other real estate professionals at Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and Pacific Oak Residential Advisors are also the key real estate professionals for other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors. As such, other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors that have funds available for investment rely on many of the same professionals, as will future programs and investors. Some investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors. Although there may be some overlap of investment opportunities, we generally do not expect to be in direct competition with these programs due to their specific investment focus and timing of funds available for investment. When these real estate and debt finance professionals direct an investment opportunity to any Pacific Oak-sponsored program or Pacific Oak-advised investors, they, in their sole discretion, will have to determine the program or investor for which the investment opportunity is most suitable based on the investment objectives, portfolio and criteria of each program or investor. As a result, these Pacific Oak real estate and debt finance professionals could direct attractive investment opportunities to other programs or investors. 
 For so long as we are externally advised, our charter provides that it shall not be a proper purpose of the corporation for us to make any significant investment unless our advisor has recommended the investment to us. Thus, the real estate and debt finance professionals of our advisor could direct attractive investment opportunities to other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs or Pacific Oak-advised investors. Such events could result in us investing in properties that provide less attractive returns, which would reduce the level of distributions we may be able to pay our stockholders. 
 We and other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors also rely on these real estate professionals to supervise the property management and leasing of properties. If the Pacific Oak team of real estate professionals directs creditworthy prospective tenants to properties owned by another Pacific Oak-sponsored program or Pacific Oak-advised investor when it could direct such tenants to our properties, our tenant base may have more inherent risk and our properties occupancy may be lower than might otherwise be the case. 
 In addition, we and other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors rely on our sponsor and other key real estate professionals at our advisor and its affiliates to sell our properties. These Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to sell these properties at the same time we are attempting to sell some of our properties. If our advisor directs potential purchasers to properties owned by another Pacific Oak-sponsored program or Pacific Oak-advised investor when it could direct such purchasers to our properties, we may be unable to sell some or all of our properties at the time or at the price we otherwise would, which could limit our ability to pay distributions and reduce our stockholders overall investment return. 
 Further, existing and future Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors and Messrs. Hall and McMillan generally are not and will not be prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business or from possessing interests in any other business venture or ventures, including businesses and ventures involved in the acquisition, origination, development, ownership, leasing or sale of real estate-related investments. 
 Pacific Oak Capital Advisors will face conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures that we may form with affiliates of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, which conflicts could result in a disproportionate benefit to the other venture partners at our expense. 
 If approved by both a majority of our board of directors and a majority of our independent directors, we may enter into joint venture agreements with other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs or affiliated entities for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties or other investments. Our advisor and its affiliates, the advisors to the other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and the investment advisers to institutional investors in real estate and real estate-related assets, have some of the same executive officers, directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals; and these persons will face conflicts of interest in determining which Pacific Oak program or investor should enter into any particular joint venture agreement. These persons may also face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interests of the Pacific Oak-affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture. Any joint venture agreement or transaction between us and a Pacific Oak-affiliated co-venturer will not have the benefit of arm s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers. The Pacific Oak-affiliated co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals. These co-venturers may thus benefit to our and stockholders detriment. 
 15 

Our sponsor, our officers, our advisor and the real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals assembled by our advisor face competing demands on their time and this may cause our operations and our stockholders investment in us to suffer. 
 We rely on our sponsor, our officers, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, Pacific Oak Residential Advisors and the key real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and Pacific Oak Residential Advisors have assembled for the day to day operation of our business. All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals of our advisor are also officers, affiliated directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and/or other Pacific Oak-affiliated entities. As a result of their interests in other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs, their obligations to Pacific Oak-advised investors and the fact that they engage in and they will continue to engage in other business activities on behalf of themselves and others, Messrs. Hall and McMillan and the key real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals at Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and Pacific Oak Residential Advisors face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among us, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, Pacific Oak Residential Advisors, other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs, Pacific Oak-advised investors and other business activities in which they are involved. Our executive officers and the key real estate, debt finance, management and accounting professionals affiliated with our sponsor who provide services to us are not obligated to devote a fixed amount of their time to us. In addition, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and its affiliates share many of the same key real estate, management and accounting professionals. During times of intense activity in other programs and ventures, these individuals may devote less time and fewer resources to our business than are necessary or appropriate to manage our business. Furthermore, some or all of these individuals may become employees of another Pacific Oak-sponsored program in an internalization transaction or, if we internalize our advisor, may not become our employees as a result of their relationship with other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs. If these events occur, the returns on our investments, and the value of our stockholders investment in us, may decline. 
 If we were to internalize our management or if another investment program, whether sponsored or advised by affiliates of the Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or otherwise, conducts its own internalization transaction, we could incur significant costs and/or our business could be harmed. 
 At some point in the future, we may consider internalizing the functions performed for us by Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates, although we do not currently intend to do so. Any internalization transaction could result in significant payments to the principals of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and its affiliates, including in the form of our stock which could reduce the percentage ownership of our then existing stockholders and concentrate ownership in the owners of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and its affiliates. In addition, we rely on persons employed by Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates to manage our day-to-day operating and acquisition activities. If we were to effectuate an internalization of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates, we may not be able to retain all of the employees of the Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates or to maintain relationships with other entities sponsored or advised by affiliates of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors. In addition, some of the employees of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates may provide services to one or more other investment programs. These programs or third parties may decide to retain some or all of the key employees in the future. If this occurs, these programs could hire certain of the persons currently employed by Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or its affiliates who are most familiar with our business and operations, thereby potentially adversely impacting our business. 
 All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and the key real estate and debt finance professionals assembled by our advisor face conflicts of interest related to their positions and/or interests in our advisor and its affiliates, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy and to generate returns to our stockholders. 
 All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and the key real estate and debt finance professionals assembled by our advisor are also executive officers, affiliated directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager, and/or other Pacific Oak-affiliated investment advisors that are the sponsors of other Pacific Oak-sponsored programs or are the advisors of Pacific Oak-advised investors. As a result, they owe fiduciary duties to each of these entities, their stockholders, members and limited partners and these investors, which fiduciary duties may from time to time conflict with the fiduciary duties that they owe to us and our stockholders. Their loyalties to these other entities and investors could result in action or inaction that is detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our investment and leasing opportunities. Further, Messrs. Hall and McMillan and existing and future Pacific Oak-sponsored programs and Pacific Oak-advised investors generally are not and will not be prohibited from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any business or from possessing interests in any other business venture or ventures, including businesses and ventures involved in the acquisition, development, ownership, leasing or sale of real estate investments. If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, we may be unable to generate the cash needed to pay distributions to our stockholders and to maintain or increase the value of our assets.

Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure 
 Our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders. 
 Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. To help us comply with the REIT ownership requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ), our charter prohibits a person from directly or constructively owning more than 9.8 of our outstanding shares, unless exempted by our board of directors. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock. 
 Our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of our common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that could result in a premium price to our stockholders. 
 Our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock. Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock. Such preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price to holders of our common stock. 
 Our stockholders investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; if we or our subsidiaries become an unregistered investment company, we could not continue our business. 
 Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). If we or our subsidiaries were obligated to register as investment companies, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things: 
 limitations on capital structure; 
 restrictions on specified investments; 
 prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and 
 compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase our operating expenses. 
 Under the relevant provisions of Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, an investment company is any issuer that: 
 pursuant to section 3(a)(1)(A), is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities (the primarily engaged test or 
 pursuant to section 3(a)(1)(C), is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of such issuer s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the 40 test ). Investment securities excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) (relating to private investment companies). 
 With respect to the primarily engaged test, we and our Operating Partnership are holding companies and do not intend to invest or trade in securities ourselves. Rather, through the majority-owned subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, we and our Operating Partnership will be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries, namely the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and real estate-related assets. 
 17 

If any of the subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership fail to meet the 40 test, we believe they will usually, if not always, be able to rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act for an exception from the definition of an investment company. Otherwise, they should be able to rely on the exceptions for private investment companies pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. As reflected in no-action letters, the SEC staff s position on Section 3(c)(5)(C) generally requires that an issuer maintain at least 55 of its assets in mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, or qualifying assets; at least 80 of its assets in qualifying assets plus real estate-related assets; and no more than 20 of the value of its assets in other than qualifying assets and real estate-related assets, which we refer to as miscellaneous assets. To constitute a qualifying asset under this 55 requirement, a real estate interest must meet various criteria based on no-action letters. We expect that any of the subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) will invest at least 55 of its assets in qualifying assets, and approximately an additional 25 of its assets in other types of real estate-related assets. If any subsidiary relies on Section 3(c)(5)(C), we expect to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. 
 Rapid changes in the values of our assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or our exception from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 If the market value or income potential of our qualifying real estate assets changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our non-qualifying assets, or if the market value or income potential of our assets that are considered real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act or REIT qualification tests changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our assets that are not considered real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act or REIT qualification tests, whether as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment rates or other factors, we may need to modify our investment portfolio in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exception from the definition of an investment company. If the decline in asset values or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of many of the assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT and Investment Company Act considerations. 
 Our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face. 
 Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. Under Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board s broad discretion in setting policies and our stockholders inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face. 
 Our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares under our share redemption program and, if our stockholders are able to sell their shares under the program, they may not be able to recover full the amount of their investment in our shares. 
 Our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that limit our stockholders ability to sell their shares. Our stockholders must hold their shares for at least one year in order to participate in the share redemption program, except for redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence. We limit the number of shares redeemed pursuant to the share redemption program as follows: (i) during any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5 of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year and (ii) during 2023, we may redeem no more than 2.6 million of shares in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence . During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made available 8.0 million for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death, qualifying disability , or determination of incompetence and are carry forward until depleted. We may increase or decrease this limit upon ten business days notice to stockholders. Further, we have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. These limits may prevent us from accommodating all redemption requests made in any year. Our board is free to amend, suspend or terminate the share redemption program upon 10 business days notice. 
 The price at which we will redeem shares under the program is 95 of our most recent estimated value per share. 
 18 

The most recent estimated value per share of our common stock is 10.50. For a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Market Information. The value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets and in response to the real estate and finance markets. As such, the estimated value per share does not take into account developments in our portfolio since December 2, 2022. We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update our estimated value per share no later than December 2023. Upon updating our estimated value per share, the redemption price per share will also change. Because of the restrictions of our share redemption program, our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares under the program, and if stockholders are able to sell their shares, depending upon the then current redemption price, they may not recover the amount of their investment in us. 
 The estimated value per share of our common stock may not reflect the value that stockholders will receive for their investment. 
 On December 2, 2022, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of 10.50 based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding as of September 30, 2022. There were no material changes between September 30, 2022 and December 2, 2022 to the net values of our assets and liabilities that materially impacted the overall estimated value per share. We are providing this estimated value per share to assist broker-dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340 as required by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ). This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with Practice Guideline 2013 01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the Investment Program Association IPA in April 2013. The estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation prepared by our advisor. 
 As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share, and these differences could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less our liabilities according to GAAP, nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the amount at which our shares of common stock would trade at on a national securities exchange. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not held for sale, debt prepayment penalties that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt. The estimated value per share does consider any participation or incentive fees that would be due to our advisor based on our aggregate net asset value and that would be payable in our hypothetical liquidation as of the valuation date in accordance with the terms of our advisory agreement. 
 Accordingly, with respect to the estimated value per share, we can give no assurance that: 
 a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated value per share; 
 a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated value per share upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of the company; 
 our shares of common stock would trade at the estimated value per share on a national securities exchange; 
 an independent third-party appraiser or other third-party valuation firm would agree with our estimated value per share; or 
 the methodology used to estimate our value per share would be acceptable to FINRA or for compliance with ERISA reporting requirements. 
 For a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share, see Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information. We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share in December 2023. 
 Our investors interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could reduce the overall value of their investment. 
 19 

Our common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares we issue in the future. Our charter authorizes us to issue 1,010,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 1,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock and 10,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. Our board of directors may increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. Our board may elect to (i) sell additional shares in our current or future public offerings, including through our dividend reinvestment plan if we elect to resume it, (ii) issue equity interests in private offerings, (iii) issue shares to our advisor, or its successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation or (iv) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of assets we acquire in connection with an exchange of limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. To the extent we issue additional equity interests, our stockholders percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted. In addition, depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings, the use of the proceeds and the value of our investments, our stockholders may also experience dilution in the book value and fair value of their shares and in the earnings and distributions per share. 
 Payment of fees to Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and its affiliates reduces cash available for investment and distribution and increases the risk that our stockholders will not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares. 
 Our advisor and its affiliates perform services for us in connection with the selection, acquisition, origination, management, and administration of our investments. We pay them substantial fees for these services, which results in immediate dilution to the value of our stockholders investment and reduces the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to stockholders. Compensation to be paid to our advisor may be increased subject to approval by our conflicts committee and the other limitations in our charter, which would further dilute our stockholders investment and reduce the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to stockholders. 
 We may also pay significant fees during our listing/liquidation stage. Although most of the fees payable during our listing/liquidation stage are contingent on our investors first enjoying agreed-upon investment returns, the investment-return thresholds may be reduced subject to approval by our conflicts committee and the other limitations in our charter. 
 Therefore, these fees increase the risk that the amount available for distribution to common stockholders upon a liquidation of our portfolio would be less than the price paid by our stockholders to purchase shares in our initial public offering. These substantial fees and other payments also increase the risk that our stockholders will not be able to resell their shares at a profit, even if our shares are listed on a national securities exchange. 
 Failure to procure adequate capital and funding would negatively impact our results and may, in turn, negatively affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 We depend upon the availability of adequate funding and capital for our operations. The failure to secure acceptable financing could reduce our taxable income, as our investments would no longer generate the same level of net interest income due to the lack of funding or increase in funding costs. A reduction in our net income could reduce our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that any, or sufficient, funding or capital will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us. Therefore, in the event that we cannot obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, there may be a negative impact on our ability to make distributions. 
 Although we are not currently afforded the protection of the Maryland General Corporation Law relating to deterring or defending hostile takeovers, our board of directors could opt into these provisions of Maryland law in the future, which may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a business combination. 
 Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and certain interested stockholders or affiliates of interested stockholders are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. Also under Maryland law, control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares owned by the acquirer, an officer of the corporation or an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation are excluded from the vote on whether to accord voting rights to the control shares. Should our board of directors opt into these provisions of Maryland law, it may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. Similarly, provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Maryland General Corporation Law could provide similar anti-takeover protection. 
 Our charter includes an anti-takeover provision that may discourage a stockholder from launching a tender offer for our shares. 
 20 

Our charter provides that any tender offer made by a stockholder, including any mini-tender offer, must comply with most provisions of Regulation 14D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The offering stockholder must provide us with notice of such tender offer at least 10 business days before initiating the tender offer. If the offering stockholder does not comply with these requirements, we will have the right to redeem that stockholder s shares and any shares acquired in such tender offer. In addition, the noncomplying stockholder shall be responsible for all of our expenses in connection with that stockholder s noncompliance. This provision of our charter may discourage a stockholder from initiating a tender offer for our shares and prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for their shares in such a transaction. 
 General Risks Related to Investments 
 Our investments will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate. 
 We have invested in and will continue to invest in a diverse portfolio of opportunistic real estate, real estate-related loans, real estate-related debt securities, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments. Each of these investments will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate. Our potential investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and other real estate-related investments may be similarly affected by real estate property values. The value of real estate may be adversely affected by a number of risks, including: 
 natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and pandemics; 
 acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001; 
 adverse changes in national and local economic and real estate conditions; 
 an oversupply of (or a reduction in demand for) space in the areas where particular properties are located and the attractiveness of particular properties to prospective tenants; 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance therewith and the potential for liability under applicable laws; 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions affecting properties; and 
 the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses. 
 The value of each property is affected significantly by its ability to generate cash flow and net income, which in turn depends on the amount of rental or other income that can be generated net of expenses required to be incurred with respect to the property. Many expenditures associated with properties (such as operating expenses and capital expenditures) cannot be reduced when there is a reduction in income from the properties. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our borrowers to pay their loans and our tenants to pay their rent, as well as on the value that we can realize from other real estate-related assets we originate, own or acquire. 
 We depend on tenants for revenue, and lease defaults or terminations could reduce our net income and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 The success of our real estate investments materially depends on the financial stability of our tenants. A default or termination by a significant tenant on its lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue associated with such lease and could require us to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments and prevent a foreclosure, if the property is subject to a mortgage. In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property. If a tenant defaults on or terminates a significant lease, we may be unable to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss. These events could cause us to reduce the amount of distributions to our stockholders. 
 We are dependent on the third-party managers of our hotels. 
 We currently own one hotel property. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are not able to operate any hotel properties or participate in the decisions affecting the daily operations of any such hotels. We will lease any hotels we acquire to a taxable REIT subsidiary or TRS in which we may own up to a 100 interest. Our TRS will enter into management agreements with eligible independent contractors that are not our subsidiaries or otherwise controlled by us to manage the hotels. Thus, independent hotel operators, under management agreements with our TRS, will control the daily operations of any hotels we own. 
 21 

We depend on these independent management companies to adequately operate our hotels as provided in the management agreements. We will not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of the daily operations of any hotel (for instance, setting room rates). Thus, even if we believe our hotels are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory occupancy rates, revenue per available room and average daily rates, we may not be able to force the management company to change its method of operation of our hotels. We can only seek redress if a management company violates the terms of the applicable management agreement with the TRS, and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the management agreement. In the event that we need to replace our management company, we may be required by the terms of the management agreement to pay substantial termination fees and may experience significant disruptions at the affected hotel. 
 Properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on these properties. 
 A property may incur vacancies either by the expiration of tenant leases or the continued default of tenants under their leases. If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash available to distribute to our stockholders. In addition, because a property s market value depends principally upon the value of the leases associated with that property, the resale value of a property with high or prolonged vacancies could suffer, which could further reduce our returns. 
 Our opportunistic property-acquisition strategy involves a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in other properties. 
 A substantial portion of our portfolio consists of direct investments in opportunistic real estate. We consider opportunistic or enhanced-return properties to be properties with significant possibilities for short-term capital appreciation, such as non-stabilized properties, properties with moderate vacancies or near-term lease rollovers, poorly managed and positioned properties, properties owned by distressed sellers and built-to-suit properties. These properties may include, but are not limited to, office, industrial and retail properties, hospitality properties and undeveloped residential lots. 
 Traditional performance metrics of real estate assets may not be meaningful for opportunistic real estate. Non-stabilized properties, for example, do not have stabilized occupancy rates to provide a useful measure of revenue. Appraisals may provide a sense of the value of the investment, but any appraisal of the property will be based on numerous estimates, judgments and assumptions that significantly affect the appraised value of the underlying property. Further, an appraisal of a non-stabilized property, in particular, involves a high degree of subjectivity due to high vacancy levels and uncertainties with respect to future market rental rates and timing of lease-up and stabilization. Accordingly, different assumptions may materially change the appraised value of the property. In addition, the value of the property will change over time. 
 In addition, we may pursue more than one strategy to create value in an opportunistic real estate investment. These strategies may include development, redevelopment, or lease-up of such property. Our ability to generate a return on these investments will depend on numerous factors, some or all of which may be out of our control, such as (i) our ability to correctly price an asset that is not generating an optimal level of revenue or otherwise performing under its potential, (ii) our ability to choose and execute on a successful value-creating strategy, (iii) our ability to avoid delays, regulatory hurdles, and other potential impediments, (iv) local market conditions, and (v) competition for similar properties in the same market. The factors described above make it challenging to evaluate opportunistic real estate investments and make investments in such properties riskier than investments in other properties. 
 Investment in non-conforming and non-investment grade loans may involve increased risk of loss. 
 Loans we acquire or originate may not conform to conventional loan criteria applied by traditional lenders and may not be rated or may be rated as non-investment grade. Non-investment grade ratings for these loans typically result from the overall leverage of the loans, the lack of a strong operating history for the properties underlying the loans, the borrowers credit history, the properties underlying cash flow or other factors. As a result, non-conforming and non-investment grade loans we acquire or originate may have a higher risk of default and loss than conventional loans. Any loss we incur may reduce distributions to stockholders and adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 Risks of cost overruns and non-completion of the construction or renovation of the properties underlying loans we make or acquire may materially and adversely affect our investment. 
 The renovation, refurbishment or expansion by a borrower under a mortgaged or leveraged property involves risks of cost overruns and non-completion. Costs of construction or improvements to bring a property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property may exceed original estimates, possibly making a project uneconomical. Other risks may include environmental risks and the possibility of construction, rehabilitation and subsequent leasing of the property not being completed on schedule. If such construction or renovation is not completed in a timely manner, or if it costs more than expected, the borrower may experience a prolonged impairment of net operating income and may not be able to make payments on our investment. 
 
 22 

Investments that are not United States government insured involve risk of loss. 
 We may originate and acquire uninsured loans and assets as part of our investment strategy. Such loans and assets may include mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and bridge loans. While holding such interests, we are subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance. In the event of any default under loans, we bear the risk of loss of principal and nonpayment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal amount of the loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to our investments in such loans, the value of our company and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 
 Prepayments can adversely affect the yields on our investments. 
 The yields of our assets may be affected by the rate of prepayments differing from our projections. Prepayments on debt instruments, where permitted under the debt documents, are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic and other factors beyond our control, and consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to invest the proceeds of any prepayments we receive in assets with at least an equivalent yield, the yield on our portfolio will decline. In addition, we may acquire assets at a discount or premium and if the asset does not repay when expected, our anticipated yield may be impacted. Under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios we may fail to recoup fully our cost of acquisition of certain investments. 
 If credit spreads widen before we obtain long-term financing for our assets, the value of our assets may suffer. 
 We will price our assets based on our assumptions about future credit spreads for financing of those assets. We expect to obtain longer-term financing for our assets using structured financing techniques in the future. In such financings, interest rates are typically set at a spread over a certain benchmark, such as the yield on United States Treasury obligations, swaps, or SOFR. If the spread that borrowers will pay over the benchmark widens and the rates we charge on our assets to be securitized are not increased accordingly, our income may be reduced or we may suffer losses. 
 Hedging against interest rate and foreign currency exposure may adversely affect our earnings, limit our gains or result in losses, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level of interest rates, the type of portfolio investments held, the foreign currency held and other changing market conditions. Interest rate and foreign currency hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things: 
 interest rate and foreign currency hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates or exchange rates, as applicable; 
 available interest rate and foreign currency hedging products may not correspond directly with the risk for which protection is sought; 
 the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability or asset; 
 the amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions to offset losses due to fluctuations in interest rates is limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs; 
 the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; 
 the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay; and 
 we may purchase a hedge that turns out not to be necessary, i.e., a hedge that is out of the money. 
 Any hedging activity we engage in may adversely affect our earnings, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates or exchange rates, as applicable, may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the interest rate risk or exchange rate risk sought to be hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended accounting treatment and may expose us to risk of loss. 
 Hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities and involve risks and costs. 
 23 

The cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. We may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising and hedging costs have increased. In addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities. Consequently, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our resale commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot be certain that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses. 
 We will assume the credit risk of our counterparties with respect to derivative transactions. 
 We may enter into derivative contracts for risk management purposes to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on our future variable rate real estate loans receivable and variable rate notes payable. These derivative contracts generally are entered into with bank counterparties and are not traded on an organized exchange or guaranteed by a central clearing organization. We would therefore assume the credit risk that our counterparties will fail to make periodic payments when due under these contracts or become insolvent. If a counterparty fails to make a required payment, becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case, or otherwise defaults under the applicable contract, we would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions with that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost. In such an event, we may be required to make a termination payment to the counterparty, or we may have the right to collect a termination payment from such counterparty. We assume the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to make any termination payment owing to us. We may not receive any collateral from a counterparty, or we may receive collateral that is insufficient to satisfy the counterparty s obligation to make a termination payment. If a counterparty is the subject of a bankruptcy case, we will be an unsecured creditor in such case unless the counterparty has pledged sufficient collateral to us to satisfy the counterparty s obligations to us. 
 We will assume the risk that our derivative counterparty may terminate transactions early. 
 If we fail to make a required payment or otherwise default under the terms of a derivative contract, the counterparty would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions between us and that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost. In certain circumstances, the counterparty may have the right to terminate derivative transactions early even if we are not defaulting. If our derivative transactions are terminated early, it may not be possible for us to replace those transactions with another counterparty, on as favorable terms or at all. 
 We may be required to collateralize our derivative transactions. 
 We may be required to secure our obligations to our counterparties under our derivative contracts by pledging collateral to our counterparties. That collateral may be in the form of cash, securities or other assets. If we default under a derivative contract with a counterparty, or if a counterparty otherwise terminates one or more derivative contracts early, that counterparty may apply such collateral toward our obligation to make a termination payment to the counterparty. If we have pledged securities or other assets, the counterparty may liquidate those assets in order to satisfy our obligations. If we are required to post cash or securities as collateral, such cash or securities will not be available for use in our business. Cash or securities pledged to counterparties may be repledged by counterparties and may not be held in segregated accounts. Therefore, in the event of a counterparty insolvency, we may not be entitled to recover some or all collateral pledged to that counterparty, which could result in losses and have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 24 

Our investments in debt securities and preferred and common equity securities will be subject to the specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities and may involve greater risk of loss than secured debt financings. 
 We may make equity investments in funds or corporate entities with a primary focus on the commercial real estate and real estate finance industries or with significant exposure to real estate, such as REITs, hotels and gaming companies. We may purchase the common or preferred stock of these entities or purchase or write options with respect to their stock. We may eventually seek to acquire or gain a controlling interest in the companies that we target. We do not expect our non-controlling equity investments in other public companies to represent a substantial portion of our assets at any one time. We may also invest in debt securities and preferred equity securities issued by funds or corporate entities with a primary focus on the commercial real estate and real estate finance industries or with significant exposure to real estate. Our investments in debt securities and preferred and common equity securities will involve special risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer. Issuers that are REITs and other real estate companies are subject to the inherent risks associated with real estate investments. Furthermore, debt securities and preferred and common equity securities may involve greater risk of loss than secured debt financings due to a variety of factors, including that such investments are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. As a result, investments in debt securities and preferred and common equity securities are subject to risks of (i) limited liquidity in the secondary trading market, (ii) substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates, (iii) subordination to the claims of banks and senior lenders to the issuer, (iv) the operation of mandatory sinking fund or call/redemption provisions during periods of declining interest rates that could cause the issuer to reinvest redemption proceeds in lower yielding assets, (v) the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations, and (vi) the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding debt securities and preferred and common equity securities and the ability of the issuers thereof to make principal, interest and/or distribution payments to us. 
 Declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect periodic reported results of operations and credit availability, which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Our investments in equity securities are carried at estimated fair value and temporary changes in the market values of those assets will be directly charged or credited to the income statement. 
 A decline in the market value of our assets may adversely affect us, particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets. If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan. If we were unable to post the additional collateral, we may have to sell assets at a time when we might not otherwise choose to do so. A reduction in credit available may reduce our earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to stockholders. 
 Further, credit facility providers may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unlevered assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position, which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on equity. In the event that we are unable to meet these contractual obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly. 
 Market values of our investments may decline for a number of reasons, such as changes in prevailing interest rates, increases in defaults, increases in voluntary prepayments for our investments that are subject to prepayment risk, widening of credit spreads, downgrades of ratings of the securities by ratings agencies and global recession or significant declines in the overall economy. 
 Our joint venture partners could take actions that decrease the value of an investment to us and lower our stockholders overall return. 
 We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, joint ventures with third parties to make investments. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations. Such investments may involve risks not otherwise present with other methods of investment, including, for example, the following risks: 
 that our co-venturer or partner in an investment could become insolvent or bankrupt; 
 that such co-venturer or partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals that are or that become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; or 
 that such co-venturer or partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. 
 Any of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that co-venturer or partner. 
 
 25 

Our due diligence may not reveal all of a borrower s liabilities and may not reveal other weaknesses in its business. 
 Before making a loan to a borrower or acquiring debt or equity securities of a company, we assess the strength and skills of such entity s management and other factors that we believe are material to the performance of the investment. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence, we rely on the resources available to us and, in some cases, an investigation by third parties. This process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly organized or private entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities. There can be no assurance that our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful. 
 We depend on debtors for our revenue, and, accordingly, our revenue and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will be dependent upon the success and economic viability of such debtors. 
 The success of our investments in real estate-related loans, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments materially depend on the financial stability of the debtors underlying such investments. The inability of a single major debtor or a number of smaller debtors to meet their payment obligations could result in reduced revenue or losses for us. 
 Our inability to sell a property at the time and on the terms we want could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders. 
 Many factors that are beyond our control affect the real estate market and could affect our ability to sell properties for the price, on the terms or within the time frame that we desire. These factors include general economic conditions, the availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, we have a limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Further, before we can sell a property on the terms we want, it may be necessary to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements. However, we can give no assurance that we will have the funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements. We may be unable to sell our properties at a profit. Our inability to sell properties at the time and on the terms we want could reduce our cash flow and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of our shares. 
 Potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks may hinder our operating results and decrease our net income. 
 From time to time, we may acquire real property or properties that are under development or construction. Investments in such properties will be subject to the uncertainties associated with the development and construction of real property, including those related to re-zoning land for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups and our builders ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs and timetables. If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance. A builder s performance may also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder s control. Delays in completing construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases. We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction. These and other factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment. In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects. We also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a purchase price at the time we acquire the property. If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and the return on our investment could suffer. 
 Costs imposed pursuant to governmental laws and regulations may reduce our net income and the cash available for distributions to our stockholders. 
 Real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health. We could be subject to liability in the form of fines, penalties or damages for noncompliance with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the remediation of contamination associated with the release or disposal of solid and hazardous materials, the presence of toxic building materials, and other health and safety-related concerns. 
 Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on the tenants, owners or operators of real property for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault, whether the contamination occurred prior to purchase, or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. Activities of our tenants, the condition of properties at the time we buy them, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties. 
 The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly manage or remediate these substances, may hinder our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. Any material expenditures, fines, penalties, or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions and may reduce the value of our shares. 
 26 

The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may decrease cash available for distributions. 
 Our properties may be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, or the Disabilities Act. Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities that generally require that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The Disabilities Act s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages. Any funds used for Disabilities Act compliance will reduce our net income and the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders. 
 Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage could reduce our cash flows and the return on our stockholders investment. 
 There are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential acts of terrorism could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans. Such insurance policies may not be available at reasonable costs, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We may not have adequate coverage for such losses. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which may reduce the value of our shares. In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property. Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower distributions to our stockholders. 
 Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we plan to operate, which could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders overall return. 
 Terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs. Certain of our investments are located in major metropolitan areas. Insurance risks associated with potential acts of terrorism against office and other properties in major metropolitan areas could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial owners as a condition for providing loans. We may not be able to obtain insurance against the risk of terrorism because it may not be available or may not be available on terms that are economically feasible. The terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks. In addition, certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others may not be covered by our terrorism insurance. The costs of obtaining terrorism insurance and any uninsured losses we may suffer as a result of terrorist attacks could reduce the returns on our investments and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 27 

Properties acquired as part of portfolios or in bulk may subject us to a variety of risks. 
 We expect that a substantial portion of future residential home property acquisitions will be purchased as portfolios in bulk from owners of portfolios of residential homes. To the extent the management and leasing of such properties have not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards, we may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the tenants and compliance with applicable laws, among others. In addition, financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may not be accurate, and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers. To the extent we timely pursue such remedies, we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies. 
 A number of our residential home properties are part of home owners associations (HOAs), and we and tenants of such properties are subject to the rules and regulations of such HOAs, which may be arbitrary or restrictive. Violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees, penalties and litigation with such HOAs which would be costly. 
 A number of our residential home properties are located within HOAs, which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of, and levy assessments on, properties in a residential subdivision. We pay all HOA fees and assessments directly. The majority of the HOA fees due on our properties are billed annually. The fees are paid when due by our property managers and are included in our property and operating expenses. HOAs in which we own properties may have or may enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore, market or lease our properties or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets. Such rules may include requirements for landscaping, limitations on signage promoting a property for lease or sale or the requirement that specific construction materials be used in restorations. Some HOAs also impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes, which, if met or exceeded, would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs of lost rental revenue. Furthermore, many HOAs impose restrictions on the conduct of occupants of homes and the use of common areas, and we may have tenants who violate HOA rules and for which we may be liable as the property owner. Additionally, the boards of directors of the HOAs in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to HOA records, initiate litigation, restrict our ability to sell our properties, impose assessments or arbitrarily change the HOA rules. We may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with HOA rules before purchasing a property, and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss, prevent us from renting such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property, which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties. 
 We are subject to tenant relief laws and may be subject to rent control laws, which could negatively impact our rental revenue. 
 As an owner of residential home rental properties, we expect that we will regularly be seeking to evict tenants who are not paying their rent or are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease. Eviction activities will result in additional legal costs and require the time and attention of our management. The eviction process is typically subject to numerous legal requirements and mandatory cure policies, which may increase our costs and delay our ability to gain possession of and stabilize a property. Additionally, state and local landlord-tenant laws may impose legal duties on us to assist tenants in relocating to new housing, or restrict our ability to recover certain costs or charge tenants for damage tenants cause to our property. Because such laws vary by state and locality, we will need to be familiar with and take appropriate steps to comply with applicable landlord-tenant laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and we will need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance. To the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws, we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals, a class of plaintiffs or by state or local law enforcement. We may be required to pay our adversaries litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation. 
 Furthermore, rent control laws may affect our rental revenue. Especially in times of recession and economic slowdown, rent control initiatives can receive significant political support. If rent control becomes applicable to certain of our properties, the effects on both our rental revenue and the value of such properties could be material and adverse. 
 
 28 

Class action, tenants rights and consumer rights litigation may result in increased expenses and harm our results. 
 There are numerous tenants rights and consumer rights organizations that operate in our residential home property markets, and, as we grow in scale, we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands or litigation. With the increased market for residential rentals arising from former homeowners who may have lost their properties, some of these organizations may shift their litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlord-tenant issues, including issues relating to the Fair Housing Act, or FHA, and its state law counterparts. While we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant and consumer laws, such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one state or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief. We cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take if initiated or what remedies they may seek. Additionally, these organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us or may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain our business operations. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could limit our business operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses, including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions. 
 Poor tenant selection and defaults by our tenants may negatively affect our financial performance and reputation. 
 Our success with residential home rentals will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified tenants for our residential home properties. This will depend, in turn, upon our ability to screen applicants, identify good tenants and avoid tenants who may default. We will inevitably make mistakes in our selection of tenants, and we may rent to tenants whose default on our leases or failure to comply with the terms of the lease or HOA regulations negatively affect our financial performance, reputation and the quality and value of our properties. For example, tenants may default on payment of rent, make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements, make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities, make use of our properties for illegal purposes, damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties which may not be fully covered by security deposits, refuse to leave the property when the lease is terminated, engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances, disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores, fail to comply with HOA regulations, sub-let to less desirable individuals in violation of our leases or permit unauthorized persons to live with them. In addition, defaulting tenants will often be effectively judgment-proof. The process of evicting a defaulting tenant from a family residence can be adversarial, protracted and costly. Furthermore, some tenants facing eviction may damage or destroy the property. Damage to our properties may significantly delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental revenue or value of the property, resulting in a lower than expected rate of return. In addition, we will incur turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties, such as marketing expense and brokerage commissions, and will not collect revenue while the property is vacant. Although we will attempt to work with tenants to prevent such damage or destruction, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in all or most cases. Such tenants will not only cause us not to achieve our financial objectives for the properties in which they live, but may subject us to liability, and may damage our reputation with our other tenants and in the communities where we do business. 
 Risks Related to Our Financing Strategy 
 We use leverage in connection with our investments, which increases the risk of loss associated with our investments. 
 We have financed the acquisition and origination of a portion of our investments with mortgages and other borrowings. Although the use of leverage may enhance returns and increase the number of investments that we can make, it may also substantially increase the risk of loss. Our ability to execute this strategy depends on various conditions in the financing markets that are beyond our control, including liquidity and credit spreads. There can be no assurance that leveraged financing will be available to us on favorable terms or that, among other factors, the terms of such financing will parallel the maturities of the underlying assets acquired. If our strategy is not viable, we will have to find alternative forms of long-term financing for our assets, as secured revolving credit facilities and repurchase facilities may not accommodate long-term financing. This could subject us to more restrictive recourse indebtedness and the risk that debt service on less efficient forms of financing would require a larger portion of our cash flows, thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders, for our operations and for future business opportunities. If alternative financing is not available, we may have to liquidate assets at unfavorable prices to pay off such financing. The return on our investments and cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that we can derive from the assets we acquire.

We may use leverage in connection with any real estate investments we make, which increases the risk of loss associated with this type of investment. 
 We may finance the acquisition and origination of certain real estate-related investments with warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements. In addition, we may engage in various types of securitizations in order to finance our loan originations. Although the use of leverage may enhance returns and increase the number of investments that we can make, it may also substantially increase the risk of loss. There can be no assurance that leveraged financing will be available to us on favorable terms or that, among other factors, the terms of such financing will parallel the maturities of the underlying assets acquired. If alternative financing is not available, we may have to liquidate assets at unfavorable prices to pay off such financing. The return on our investments and cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions cause the cost of our financing to increase relative to the income that we can derive from the assets we acquire. 
 Our debt service payments will reduce our cash available for distribution. We may not be able to meet our debt service obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy our debt obligations. If we utilize repurchase agreement financing and if the market value of the assets subject to a repurchase agreement declines, we may be required to provide additional collateral or make cash payments to maintain the loan to collateral value ratio. If we are unable to provide such collateral or cash repayments, we may lose our economic interest in the underlying assets. Further, credit facility providers and warehouse facility providers may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unleveraged assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position that would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations. As a result, we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on investment. In the event that we are unable to meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly. 
 We may not be able to access financing sources on attractive terms, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. 
 We may finance our assets over the long-term through a variety of means, including repurchase agreements, credit facilities, issuances of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured financings. Our ability to execute this strategy will depend on various conditions in the markets for financing in this manner that are beyond our control, including lack of liquidity and greater credit spreads. We cannot be certain that these markets will remain an efficient source of long-term financing for our assets. If our strategy is not viable, we will have to find alternative forms of long-term financing for our assets, as secured revolving credit facilities and repurchase agreements may not accommodate long-term financing. This could subject us to more recourse indebtedness and the risk that debt service on less efficient forms of financing would require a larger portion of our cash flow, thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for operations as well as for future business opportunities. 
 High mortgage rates or changes in underwriting standards may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce our cash flows from operations and the amount of cash distributions we can make. 
 If mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance our properties. If we place mortgage debt on a property, we run the risk of being unable to refinance part or all of the property subject to the mortgage debt when it becomes due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance properties subject to mortgage debt, our income could be reduced. We may be unable to refinance or may only be able to partly refinance properties if underwriting standards, including loan to value ratios and yield requirements, among other requirements, are more strict than when we originally financed the properties. If any of these events occur, our cash flow could be reduced and/or we might have to pay down existing mortgages. This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders, could cause us to require additional capital and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money. 
 Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 When providing financing, a lender may impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Loan agreements into which we enter may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage a property or that prohibit us from discontinuing insurance coverage or replacing Pacific Oak Capital Advisors as our advisor. These or other limitations would decrease our operating flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating objectives. 
 Increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 We have incurred significant amounts of variable rate debt. Increases in interest rates will increase the cost of that debt, which could reduce our cash flows from operations and the cash we have available to pay distributions to our stockholders. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments. 
 30 

In a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense could increase while the interest we earn on our fixed-rate assets would not change, which would adversely affect our profitability. 
 Our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets, net of credit losses and financing costs. Income from our assets may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net income. Increases in these rates will tend to decrease our net income and market value of our assets. Interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding our interest income would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We have incurred debt and increases in interest rates will increase the cost of that debt, which could reduce our cash flow from operations and the cash we have available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments. 
 Risks related to variable rate indebtedness could increase the amount of our debt payments and therefore negatively impact our operating results. 
 Our debt may be subject to the fluctuation of market interest rates such as LIBOR, Prime rate, and other benchmark rates. Should such interest rates increase, our variable rate debt service payments may also increase, reducing cash available for distributions. Furthermore, if we need to refinance existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times given the property may not support the same level of loan proceeds which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments. Additionally, as it relates to any real estate assets that we may own, an increase in interest rates may negatively impact activity in the consumer market and reduce consumer purchases, which could adversely affect us. 
 Furthermore, U.S. and international regulators and law enforcement agencies have conducted investigations into a number of rates or indices which are deemed to be reference rates. Actions by such regulators and law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which certain reference rates are determined, their discontinuance, or the establishment of alternative reference rates. On March 5, 2021 the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA ), which regulates LIBOR, announced that all LIBOR tenors will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. Following such announcement, on the same date, the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA indicated that it would cease publication of such LIBOR tenors immediately after the last publication on June 30, 2023. As a result, we expect that any of our assets or liabilities with interest rates tied to LIBOR that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has advised banks to stop entering into new United States dollar LIBOR-based contracts. 
 The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large United States financial institutions, recommended replacing United States dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR plus a recommended spread adjustment as LIBOR s replacement. As we convert certain of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in higher interest costs on our debt or lower return on our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We have broad authority to incur debt and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and decrease the value of our stockholders investment. 
 Our charter limits our total liabilities to 75 of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee of our board of directors approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2022, our borrowings and other liabilities were both approximately 70 of the cost (before depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments and may also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of our stockholders investment. 
 
 31 

The change in the value of Israeli currency may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 On February 16, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued 254.1 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 74.1 million as of February 16, 2020) of Series B debentures to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering, which bonds are denominated in Israeli new Shekels. The Series B Debentures bear interest at the rate of 3.93 per year. The Series B Debentures have principal installment payments equal to 33.33 of the face amount of the Series B Debentures on January 31st of each year from 2024 to 2026. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued additional Series B Debentures subsequent to the initial issuance and as of December 31, 2022, 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels (approximately 331.2 million as December 31, 2022) were outstanding. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between Israeli new Shekels and U.S. Dollars. More specifically, a significant change in the value of the Israeli new Shekels may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have attempted to mitigate this foreign currency risk by using derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will ultimately be successful. 
 The deed of trust that governs the bonds issued to Israeli investors includes restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or fund redemptions. 
 The deed of trust that governs the terms of the bonds issued to Israeli investors contains various restrictive covenants. Such restrictive covenants may prohibit us from making certain investments, selling properties or taking certain other actions that our board of directors otherwise believes to be in our best interests. Such restrictions may adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or fund redemptions. Under the deed of trust that governs the Series B Debentures, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI must meet financial covenants such as (i) a minimum equity of 475 million; (ii) a maximum debt to capital of 75 ; and (iii) a minimum adjusted net operating income of 35.0 million for the trailing twelve months. A violation of any of the foregoing financial covenants constitute an event of default, result in an increase of the interest rate of the bonds and cause the bonds to become immediately due and payable. 
 Federal Income Tax Risks 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution. 
 Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet requirements regarding our organization and ownership, distributions of our income, the nature and diversification of our income and assets and other tests imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year after electing REIT status, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates (currently, 21 rate). In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost our REIT status. Losing our REIT status would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends-paid deduction and we would no longer be required to pay distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax. 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 We believe that we have operated and will continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010. However, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs are extremely complex, and interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Qualifying as a REIT requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding stock, and the amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT. While we intend to continue to operate so that we will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, including the tax treatment of certain investments we may make, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any calendar year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in determining our taxable income. In such a case, we might need to borrow money or sell assets to pay that tax. Our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Unless our failure to qualify as a REIT were excused under federal tax laws, we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

Our stockholders may have current tax liability on distributions they elect to reinvest in our common stock. 
 If our stockholders participated in our dividend reinvestment plan, prior to its suspension as of March 28, 2023, they will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital. In addition, our stockholders will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having received an additional distribution to the extent the shares are purchased at a discount to fair market value, if any. As a result, unless our stockholders are tax-exempt entities, they may have to use funds from other sources to pay their tax liability on the value of the shares of common stock received. 
 Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to federal, state, local or other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. For example: 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders (which is determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain). To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income and our net capital gain, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. 
 We will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. 
 If we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as foreclosure property, we may avoid the 100 tax on the gain from a resale of that property, but the income from the sale or operation of that property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate. 
 If we sell an asset, other than foreclosure property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, our gain would be subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax unless such sale were made by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries or the sale met certain safe harbor requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Any domestic taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, of ours will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its income, and on any non-arm s-length transactions between us and any TRS, for instance, excessive rents charged to a TRS could be subject to a 100 tax. We may be subject to tax on income from certain activities conducted as a result of taking title to collateral. 
 We may be subject to state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. 
 REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. 
 We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income (and any net capital gain), we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on undistributed amounts. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed taxable income. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders (for example, where a borrower defers the payment of interest in cash pursuant to a contractual right or otherwise). If we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds, sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to pay distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 
 33 

To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive business or investment opportunities, which may delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders overall return. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy certain tests on an ongoing basis concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, nature of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. We may be required to pay distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits and reduce the value of our stockholders investment. 
 If our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its income would be subject to taxation and our REIT status would be terminated. 
 We currently intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a disregarded entity or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. During periods in which our operating partnership is treated as a disregarded entity, our operating partnership will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Rather, its income will be attributed to us as the sole owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the operating partnership. However, during periods in which our operating partnership has more than one owner, if the Internal Revenue Service IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership, it would potentially be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our operating partnership could make to us. This would also result in our losing REIT status and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our own income. This would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the return on a stockholder s investment. In addition, if any of the entities through which our operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the underlying entity would become subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to our operating partnership and jeopardizing our ability to maintain REIT status. 
 Potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors. 
 If (i) all or a portion of our assets are subject to the rules relating to taxable mortgage pools, (ii) we are a pension-held REIT, (iii) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (iv) the residual Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit interests, or REMICs, we buy (if any) generate excess inclusion income, then a portion of the distributions to and, in the case of a stockholder described in clause (iii), gains realized on the sale of common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 The tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of assets, other than foreclosure property, deemed held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us. 
 It may be possible to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax by conducting certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries. However, to the extent that we engage in such activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries, the income associated with such activities may be subject to full corporate income tax. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20 (25 for taxable years before 2018) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries and no more than 25 of the value of our total assets can be represented by non-qualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 34 

Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory. 
 Our acquisition of debt or securities investments may cause us to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt investments. 
 We may acquire debt or securities investments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The amount of such discount will generally be treated as a market discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If these debt or securities investments provide for payment-in-kind interest, we may recognize original issue discount, or OID, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding debt constitute significant modifications under the applicable Department of the Treasury regulations Treasury Regulations ), the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower. In that event, if the debt is considered to be publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the modified debt in our hands may be considered to have been issued with OID to the extent the fair market value of the modified debt is less than the principal amount of the outstanding debt. In the event the debt is not considered to be publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it. Also, certain loans that we originate and later modify and certain previously modified debt we acquire in the secondary market may be considered to have been issued with the OID at the time it was modified. 
 In general, we will be required to accrue OID on a debt instrument as taxable income in accordance with applicable federal income tax rules even though no cash payments may be received on such debt instrument on a current basis. 
 In the event a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate mortgage-backed securities at the stated rate regardless of when their corresponding cash payments are received. 
 In order to meet the REIT distribution requirements, it might be necessary for us to arrange for short-term, or possibly long-term borrowings, or to pay distributions in the form of our shares or other taxable in-kind distributions of property. We may need to borrow funds at times when the market conditions are unfavorable. Such borrowings could increase our costs and reduce the value of a stockholder s investment. In the event in-kind distributions are made, a stockholder s tax liabilities associated with an investment in our common stock for a given year may exceed the amount of cash we distribute to such stockholder during such year. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively. 
 The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate, inflation and/or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75 and 95 gross income tests if the purpose of the instrument is to (i) hedge interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate, (ii) hedge risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the REIT 75 or 95 gross income tests, or (iii) manage risk with respect to the termination of certain prior hedging transactions described in (i) and/or (ii) above and, in each case, such instrument is properly identified under applicable Department of the Treasury regulations Treasury Regulations ). Income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75 and 95 gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur. 
 
 35 

Our ownership of and relationship with our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax. 
 A REIT may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. A taxable REIT subsidiary may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A corporation of which a taxable REIT subsidiary directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Overall, no more than 20 (25 for taxable years before 2018) of the value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. A domestic taxable REIT subsidiary will pay federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its parent REIT to assure that the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to comply with the 20 value limitation on ownership of taxable REIT subsidiary stock and securities on an ongoing basis so as to maintain REIT status or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax imposed on certain non-arm s length transactions. 
 If any hotel managers that we may engage do not qualify as eligible independent contractors, or if our hotel is not a qualified lodging facility, we will fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 Rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of ours generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs, but an exception is provided for leases of qualified lodging facilities to a TRS so long as the hotel is managed by an eligible independent contractor and certain other requirements are satisfied. We expect to lease all or substantially all hotels to the TRS lessee, which is a disregarded subsidiary that is intended to qualify as a TRS. We expect that the TRS lessee will engage hotel managers, including our affiliated property manager and third-party property managers that are intended to qualify as eligible independent contractors. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, the hotel manager must not own, directly or through its equity owners, more than 35 of our outstanding stock, and no person or group of persons can own more than 35 of our outstanding stock and the equity interests of the hotel manager, taking into account certain ownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35 thresholds are complex and monitoring actual and constructive ownership of our stock by our hotel managers and their owners may not be practical. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded. 
 In addition, for a hotel management company to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities (as defined below) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRS at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a TRS or its TRS lessee. No assurances can be provided that any hotel managers that we may engage will in fact comply with this requirement in the future. Failure to comply with this requirement would require us to find other managers for future contracts, and if we hired a management company without knowledge of the failure, it could jeopardize our status as a REIT. 
 Finally, each property that we lease to our TRS lessee must be a qualified lodging facility. A qualified lodging facility is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. The REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities, and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied. 
 The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders. 
 Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. While we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may not elect to be treated as a REIT or may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests. If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.

Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates. 
 In general, the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for this reduced rate; provided under current law, individuals may be able to deduct 20 of income received as ordinary REIT dividends until 2026, thus reducing the maximum effective U.S. federal income tax rate on such dividend to 29.6 . In addition, Treasury Regulations impose a minimum holding period for the 20 deduction that was not set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Treasury Regulations, in order for a REIT dividend with respect to a share of REIT stock to be treated as a qualified REIT dividend, the U.S. stockholder (i) must have held the share for more than 45 days during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend and (ii) cannot have been under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property, e.g., pursuant to a short sale. While this tax treatment does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts or estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock. 
 If the IRS were to successfully recast our Israeli bond offerings as equity issuances rather than borrowings, our REIT qualification could be threatened. 
 We have structured our Israeli bond offerings to be viewed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a borrowing by us via disregarded entities. If the IRS were to successfully recast our Israeli bond offerings as equity issuances rather than borrowings, our REIT qualification could be threatened. 
 Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 The taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex; however, distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce their anticipated returns from an investment in us. 
 Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may (i) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (ii) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from non-REIT corporations, such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries, or (iii) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital distribution is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder s investment in our common stock. 
 We may be required to pay some taxes due to actions of a taxable REIT subsidiary which would reduce our cash available for distribution to stockholders. 
 Any net taxable income earned directly by a taxable REIT subsidiary, or through entities that are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable REIT subsidiaries, will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax. In this regard, several provisions of the laws applicable to REITs and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary may be limited in its ability to deduct certain interest payments made to an affiliated REIT. In addition, the REIT has to pay a 100 penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by a taxable REIT subsidiary if the economic arrangements between the REIT, the REIT's customers, and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. Finally, some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a REIT we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs. To the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal, state and local taxes, we will have less cash available for distributions to stockholders. 
 
 37 

We may distribute our common stock in a taxable distribution, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such distributions, and stockholders may receive less in cash than the amount of the dividend that is taxable. 
 We may make taxable distributions that are payable in cash and common stock. The IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock as taxable distributions that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued, but we could request a similar ruling from the IRS. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable distributions payable in cash and common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the dividend as taxable income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash distributions received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount recorded in earnings with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. 
 Investments in other REITs and real estate partnerships could subject us to the tax risks associated with the tax status of such entities. 
 We may invest in the securities of other REITs and real estate partnerships. Such investments are subject to the risk that any such REIT or partnership may fail to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT or a partnership, as the case may be, in any given taxable year. In the case of a REIT, such failure would subject such entity to taxation as a corporation, may require such REIT to incur indebtedness to pay its tax liabilities, may reduce its ability to make distributions to us, and may render it ineligible to elect REIT status prior to the fifth taxable year following the year in which it fails to so qualify. In the case of a partnership, such failure could subject such partnership to an entity level tax and reduce the entity s ability to make distributions to us. In addition, such failures could, depending on the circumstances, jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT. 
 Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs, generally (subject to certain exceptions for qualified foreign pension funds and certain qualified shareholders will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder (other than a qualified foreign pension plan, entities wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension plan and certain publicly traded foreign entities) as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business unless FIRPTA provides an exemption. However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (i) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (ii) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10 of the class of our stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the distribution is received. We do not anticipate that our shares will be regularly traded on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, and therefore, this exception is not expected to apply. 
 Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA (subject to specific FIRPTA exemptions for certain non-U.S. stockholders). Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity. A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50 in value of such REIT s stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. We believe, but cannot assure stockholders, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity. 
 Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if: (a) our common stock is regularly traded, as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 10 or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale. However, it is not anticipated that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established market. We encourage stockholders to consult their tax advisors to determine the tax consequences applicable to them if they are non-U.S. stockholders. 
 38 

Our qualification as a REIT may depend upon the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets we acquire. 
 When purchasing securities, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities, or statements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining, among other things, whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the value of such securities, and also to what extent those securities constitute qualified real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests and produce qualified income for purposes of the 75 gross income test. The inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT and result in significant corporate-level tax. 
 Our charter limits the number of shares a person may own, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price paid to stockholders. 
 Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. To help us comply with the REIT ownership requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, among other purposes, our charter prohibits a person from directly or constructively owning more than 9.8 in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock of any class or series or more than 9.8 in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock, unless exempted (prospectively or retroactively) by our board of directors. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might otherwise provide a premium price for holders of our shares of common stock. 
 We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes. 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor regarding the effect of potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares of common stock. 
 Retirement Plan Risks 
 If stockholders fail to meet the fiduciary and other standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, or the Code as a result of an investment in our stock, they could be subject to criminal and civil penalties. 
 There are special considerations that apply to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA (such as profit-sharing, section 401(k) or pension plans) and other retirement plans or accounts subject to Section 4975 of the Code (such as an IRA) or any entity whose assets include such assets (each a Benefit Plan that are investing in our shares. If stockholders are investing the assets of such a plan or account in our common stock, they should satisfy themselves that: 
 the investment is consistent with their fiduciary and other obligations under ERISA and the Code; 
 the investment is made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan or IRA, including the plan s or account s investment policy; 
 the investment satisfies the prudence and diversification requirements of Sections 404(a)(1)(B) and 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA and other applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code; 
 the investment in our shares, for which no trading market may exist, is consistent with the liquidity needs of the plan or IRA; 
 the investment will not produce an unacceptable amount of unrelated business taxable income for the plan or IRA; 
 the stockholders will be able to comply with the requirements under ERISA and the Code to value the assets of the plan or IRA annually; and 
 the investment will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
 With respect to the annual valuation requirements described above, we expect to provide an estimated value of our net assets per share annually to those fiduciaries (including IRA trustees and custodians) who request it. Although this estimate will be based upon determinations of the NAV of our shares in accordance with our valuation procedures, no assurance can be given that such estimated value will satisfy the applicable annual valuation requirements under ERISA and the Code. The Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service may determine that a plan fiduciary or a fiduciary acting for an IRA is required to take further steps to determine the value of our common shares. In the absence of an appropriate determination of value, a plan fiduciary or a fiduciary acting for an IRA may be subject to damages, penalties or other sanctions. 
 39 

Failure to satisfy the fiduciary standards of conduct and other applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, and can subject the fiduciary to claims for damages or for equitable remedies, including liability for investment losses. In addition, if an investment in our shares constitutes a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code, the fiduciary or IRA owner who authorized or directed the investment may be subject to the imposition of excise taxes with respect to the amount invested. Additionally, the investment transaction may have to be undone. In the case of a prohibited transaction involving an IRA owner, the IRA may be disqualified as a tax-exempt account and all of the assets of the IRA may be deemed distributed and subjected to tax. ERISA plan fiduciaries and IRA owners should consult with counsel before making an investment in our shares. 
 If our assets are deemed to be plan assets, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and we may be exposed to liabilities under Title I of ERISA and the Code. 
 In some circumstances where an ERISA plan holds an interest in an entity, the assets of the entity are deemed to be ERISA plan assets unless an exception applies. This is known as the look-through rule. Under those circumstances, the obligations and other responsibilities of plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries and plan administrators, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons, under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be applicable, and there may be liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code. We believe that our assets should not be treated as plan assets because the shares should qualify as publicly-offered securities that are exempt from the look-through rules under applicable Treasury Regulations. We note, however, that because certain limitations are imposed upon the transferability of shares so that we may qualify as a REIT, and perhaps for other reasons, it is possible that this exemption may not apply. If that is the case, and if Pacific Oak Capital Advisors or we are exposed to liability under ERISA or the Code, our performance and results of operations could be adversely affected. Prior to making an investment in us, stockholders should consult with their legal and other advisors concerning the impact of ERISA and the Code on this investment and our performance. 
 We do not intend to provide investment advice to any potential investor for a fee. However, we, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors and our respective affiliates receive certain fees and other consideration disclosed herein in connection with an investment. If it were determined we provided a Benefit Plan investor with investment advice for a fee, it could give rise to a determination that we constitute an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA. Such a determination could give rise to claims that our fee arrangements constitute non-exempt prohibited transactions under ERISA or the Code and/or claims that we have breached a fiduciary duty to a Benefit Plan investor. Adverse determinations with respect to ERISA fiduciary status or non-exempt prohibited transactions could result in significant civil penalties and excise taxes.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Stockholder Information 
 As of March 27, 2023, we had 103.8 million shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of approximately 18,000 stockholders. The number of stockholders is based on the records of DST Systems, Inc., who serves as our transfer agent. 
 Market Information 
 No public market currently exists for our shares of common stock, and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange. Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets applicable suitability and minimum purchase requirements. In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8 of our stock, unless exempted by our board of directors. Consequently, there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a time or price acceptable to them. 
 On December 2, 2022, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of 10.50 based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2022. There have been no material changes between September 30, 2022 and the date of this filing to the net values of our assets and liabilities that materially impacted the overall estimated value per share. We are providing this estimated value per share to assist broker-dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340 as required by FINRA. This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with Practice Guideline 2013 01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives IPA in April 2013. 
 December 2, 2022 Valuation 
 Our conflicts committee, composed of all of our independent directors, is responsible for the oversight of the valuation process, including the review and approval of the valuation process and methodologies used to determine our estimated value per share, the consistency of the valuation and appraisal methodologies with real estate industry standards and practices and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the valuations and appraisals. The estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation prepared by our advisor. Our advisor s valuation of our consolidated investments in real estate properties and two of our unconsolidated entity investments in real estate properties was based on valuations performed by third-party valuation firms. Our advisor s valuation of its other unconsolidated entity investment, valued at 38.3 million or 0.37 per share, was based on our advisor s estimate of the unit value for a fund in which we own units and which is sponsored by an affiliate of our advisor. The aforementioned third-party valuations represented appraisals for our consolidated investments in real estate properties and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, except for our consolidated residential home portfolio consisting of 2,458 homes which was valued at the total of individual home values generated by the third-party valuation firm s proprietary automated valuation models. The appraisals were performed by Kroll, LLC Kroll ), except for the undeveloped land which was appraised by Colliers International Valuation Advisory Services, LLC Colliers ). Valuation of the residential home portfolio was performed by HouseCanary, Inc. HouseCanary ). Kroll, Colliers and HouseCanary, each an independent third-party valuation firm, also prepared appraisal/valuation reports, summarizing key inputs and assumptions, for each of the real estate properties they respectively valued. Our advisor performed valuations with respect to our real estate-related investments, one of its unconsolidated entity investments, cash, other assets, mortgage debt and other liabilities. The methodologies and assumptions used to determine the estimated value of our assets and the estimated value of our liabilities are described further below. 
 Our advisor used the valuations from the third-party valuation firms, an advisor adjustment downward to the appraised value for one of the properties to reflect our advisor s judgment that there is the potential to incur higher tenant-required costs at the property where a large lease is currently being negotiated, and our advisor s estimated values for other assets and liabilities to calculate and recommend an estimated value per share of our common stock. Upon (i) the conflicts committee s receipt and review of our advisor s valuation report, including our advisor s summary of the appraisal/valuation reports prepared by Kroll, Colliers and HouseCanary, and (ii) the conflicts committee s review of the reasonableness of our estimated value per share resulting from our advisor s valuation process, and (iii) in light of other factors considered by the conflicts committee and the conflicts committee s own extensive knowledge of our assets and liabilities, the conflicts committee concluded that the estimated value per share proposed by our advisor was reasonable and recommended to the board of directors that it adopt 10.50 as the estimated value per share of our common stock. At the special meeting of the board of directors, the board of directors unanimously agreed to accept the recommendation of the conflicts committee and approved 10.50 as the estimated value of our common stock, which determination is ultimately and solely the responsibility of the board of directors.

 (1) The December 2, 2021 estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation of our advisor. We engaged Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary to provide valuations of our real estate properties, investments in undeveloped land and two of its unconsolidated investments in real estate properties and our advisor performed valuations of our two other unconsolidated investments, real estate-related investments, cash, other assets, mortgage debt and other liabilities. For more information relating to the December 2, 2021 estimated value per share and the assumptions and methodologies used by Kroll (Duff Phelps, LLC), Colliers, and HouseCanary and our advisor, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2021. 
 (2) The increase in the estimated value of real estate properties was primarily due to increases in property fair values and consolidation of a previously unconsolidated entity, partially offset by declines from property dispositions. 
 (3) The decrease in mortgage debt was primarily due to repayments including those upon asset sales. 
 (4) Amount relates to Series A Debentures issued in Israel on March 8, 2016 and March 4, 2021, which were ultimately repaid on November 15, 2021. The decrease is due to repayment of the debentures on November 15, 2021. 
 (5) Amount relates to Series B Debentures issued in Israel on February 16, 2020, November 1, 2021, November 8, 2021, and May 2, 2022. The increase is due to issuance of additional debentures, partially offset by a decrease in the quoted bond price on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. 
 (6) Represents the potential participation fee payable to Pacific Oak Residential Advisors as it relates to the operations or assets of our subsidiary, Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc. 
 (7) Represents the redemption value plus accrued unpaid dividends on the Series A cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock issued by Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc. on November 6, 2019. The preferred stock was redeemed at the redemption value plus accrued unpaid dividends in November 2022. 
 (8) The decrease in non-controlling interests was primarily due to non-controlling interest distributions and a decline in one non-controlling interest value related to a property value decline. 
 (9) Our board of directors authorized a special distribution of 1.17 per share to the common stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2021, which was ultimately paid in January 2022. The special distribution was paid in shares of our common stock or cash to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record, though the stock and cash portions were subject to adjustment such that a maximum of 10 of the total special distribution was payable in cash. 
 45 

The change in our estimated value per share from the previous estimate was primarily due to the items listed below. The changes are not equal to the change in values of each asset and liability group presented in the table above due to real estate property acquisitions, dispositions, debt financings and other factors, which caused the value of certain asset or liability groups to change with no impact to our fair value of equity or the overall estimated value per share.

 (1) Operating cash flow reflects modified funds from operations MFFO attributable to common stockholders, adjusted for our share of (i) deducts for capitalized interest expense, real estate taxes and insurance and (ii) add backs for deferred financing cost amortization. We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition included in the practice guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010. 
 (2) Property selling, acquisition and financing costs include approximately (i) 14.3 million, or 0.14 per share, for financing costs including the prepayment costs related to our Series A debentures repayment on November 15, 2021 and the issuance costs related to our Series B debentures issued in November 2021 and May 2022 and (ii) 0.9 million or 0.01 per share for acquisition and selling costs. 
 (3) Advisor fees were 0.8 million or 0.01 per share. 
 
 As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share, and these differences could be significant. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the price at which our shares of common stock would trade at on a national securities exchange. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell, debt prepayment penalties that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations, the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt or hedging costs which may be incurred upon the termination of certain of our hedges prior to expiration. 
 46 

Methodology 
 Our goal for the valuation was to arrive at a reasonable and supportable estimated value per share, using a process that was designed to be in compliance with the IPA Valuation Guidelines and using what we and our advisor deemed to be appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions. The following is a summary of the real estate valuation engagements as well as the methodologies, assumptions and estimates used to value our assets and liabilities: 
 Real Estate 
 Independent Valuation Firm 
 Kroll (1) was selected by our advisor and approved by our conflicts committee to appraise all of our consolidated real estate properties, 110 William Street, and 353 Sacramento, but excluding our investments in undeveloped land and the residential home portfolio. Colliers (2) was selected by our advisor and approved by our conflicts committee to appraise our investments in undeveloped land (hereinafter the properties appraised by Kroll and Colliers are the Appraised Properties ). HouseCanary (3) was selected by our advisor and approved by our conflicts committee to provide a value for our residential home portfolio using its proprietary automated valuation models. HouseCanary s values were not appraisals and should not be construed as appraisals. Kroll and Colliers are engaged in the business of appraising commercial real estate properties, and HouseCanary is engaged in the business of real estate valuations, data, and analytics and none are affiliated with us or our advisor. The compensation we pay to Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary is based on the scope of work and not on the values of our real estate properties. In preparing their valuation reports, Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary did not, and were not requested to, inspect or otherwise evaluate the physical conditions of our properties or solicit third-party indications of interest for our properties or common stock in connection with possible purchases thereof or the acquisition of all or any part of us. 
 _____________________ 
 (1) Kroll is actively engaged in the business of appraising commercial real estate properties similar to those owned by us in connection with public securities offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. We engaged Kroll to deliver appraisal reports for all of our consolidated investments in real estate properties, 110 William Street and 353 Sacramento, but excluding our investments in undeveloped land and the residential home portfolio, and Kroll received fees upon the delivery of such reports. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Kroll against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement. In the six years prior to the date of this filing, Kroll and its affiliates have provided a number of commercial real estate, appraisal and valuation services for us and/or our affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services. Kroll and its affiliates may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate, appraisal and valuation services for us and our affiliates in transactions related to the properties that are the subjects of the appraisals, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the applicable Kroll appraiser as certified in the applicable appraisal reports. 
 (2) Colliers is actively engaged in the business of appraising commercial real estate properties similar to those owned by us in connection with public securities offerings, private placements, business combinations and similar transactions. We engaged Colliers to deliver appraisal reports for certain of our investments in undeveloped land and Colliers received fees upon the delivery of such reports. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Colliers against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement. Colliers and its affiliates are engaged in the ordinary course of business in many areas related to commercial real estate and related services. Colliers and its affiliates may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate, appraisal, valuation and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates in transactions related to the properties that are the subjects of the appraisals, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the applicable Colliers appraiser as certified in the applicable appraisal reports. 
 (3) HouseCanary is actively engaged in the business of real estate valuation, data, and analytics related to homes similar to those owned by us. We engaged HouseCanary to provide a valuation for each of the residential homes in our portfolio, and HouseCanary received fees upon the delivery of its valuation report. HouseCanary s proprietary automated valuation models generate value estimates based on multiple factors, but are not guarantees of property value, characteristics or condition. HouseCanary s valuations were provided to assist our advisor in calculating the estimated value per share of our common stock. HouseCanary did not make an independent determination as to whether its valuation methodology was suitable for such purpose or calculate or participate in the calculation of the estimated value per share. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify HouseCanary against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement. HouseCanary is engaged in the ordinary course of business in many areas related to real estate and related services. HouseCanary and its affiliates may from time to time in the future perform other valuation and advisory services for us related to the properties that are the subjects of the valuation report, so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of HouseCanary. 
 47 

Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary collected all reasonably available material information that each deemed relevant and took into account customary real estate valuation and financial considerations and procedures as each deemed relevant in valuing our real estate properties. Kroll relied in part on property-level information provided by our advisor, including (i) property historical and projected operating revenues and expenses; (ii) property lease agreements; and (iii) information regarding recent or planned capital expenditures. Colliers was provided with land surveys and development plans and relied in part on such information. HouseCanary was provided with property addresses, purchase prices and dates, and certain characteristics for each of our homes and relied in part on such information. Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary relied on the information supplied or otherwise made available by us and our advisor to be accurate and complete, prepared in good faith, and to reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments of ours and our advisor, and did not independently verify any such information. In addition, Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary relied on us or our advisor to inform them if any information previously provided became inaccurate or needed updating during the course of their engagements or if there were any exceptions to the typical assumptions that we have clear and marketable title to each real estate property, that no title defects exist, that any improvements were made in accordance with law, that no hazardous materials are present or were present previously, that no deed restrictions exist, and that no changes to zoning ordinances or regulations governing use, density or shape are pending or being considered. Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary did not independently verify any such information. 
 For the appraisals, Kroll and Colliers performed the appraisals in accordance with the Code of Ethics and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, or USPAP, the real estate appraisal industry standards created by The Appraisal Foundation, as well as the requirements of the state where each real property is located. Each appraisal was reviewed, approved and signed by an individual with the professional designation of MAI (Member of the Appraisal Institute). The use of the appraisal reports is subject to the requirements of the Appraisal Institute relating to review by its duly authorized representatives. In the appraisals, and as outlined in the appraisal reports, Kroll and Colliers necessarily made numerous assumptions as of various points in time and with respect to general business, economic, and regulatory conditions, industry performance, and other matters, many of which are beyond Kroll s and Colliers control and our control. 
 For the PORT portfolio valuations, HouseCanary generated an estimated value for each individual home using its proprietary automated valuation models built to leverage machine learning algorithms and an extensive database that may include MLS information, county assessor records, mortgage and other public records, sales history for a subject property and its surrounding neighborhood, real estate market trends, and macro and local economic and housing data. Each individual home was assigned the HouseCanary value, an estimated value generated by HouseCanary s proprietary automated valuation model, unless the dataset available did not meet specified criteria. In those cases, the individual home was assigned an indexed value, an estimated value calculated by multiplying a property's last third-party valuation by a price change factor from HouseCanary s Home Price Index. For our PORT portfolio, approximately 94 of the individual homes were assigned the automated valuation model value and 6 were assigned the indexed value as of September 30, 2022. HouseCanary s valuations were not appraisals and should not be construed as appraisals, and were based on computer models developed by HouseCanary which utilize data believed to be reliable but there can be no guarantee that the data is reliable, accurate, or complete. 
 Although Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary considered any comments received from us or our advisor to their valuations, ultimately the valuations were determined by Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary. The valuations were necessarily estimates, and the price at which our properties may actually be sold could differ materially from the valuations. The valuations were necessarily based on assumptions, analyses, opinions, and conclusions reflecting the general business, economic, financial and other circumstances and conditions, and data in existence as of or prior to the date of the valuations. Material change in assumptions, circumstances, conditions, matters, or data after the date of the valuations, or discovery after the date of the valuations that data which had been considered reliable and which had been utilized was in fact unreliable, inaccurate, or incomplete, may affect such valuations. The Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary engagement letters and the valuation reports contain qualifications and limitations that qualify the analyses, opinions, and conclusions reflected in the valuations. The valuations are addressed solely to us to assist our advisor in calculating and recommending an updated estimated value per share of our common stock, and Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary have not made independent determinations as to whether the valuations are suitable for such a purpose. The valuations are not addressed to the public and may not be relied upon by any other person to establish an estimated value per share of our common stock and do not constitute a recommendation to any person to purchase or sell any shares of our common stock. Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary were responsible only for the valuation services outlined in their engagement letters, and were not responsible for, did not calculate, and did not participate in the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock. 
 The foregoing is a summary description of the engagements, standard assumptions, qualifications and limitations that generally apply to the Kroll, Colliers, and HouseCanary valuations.

Real Estate Valuation 
 As of September 30, 2022, we had 19 consolidated real estate properties (consisting of eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings, two apartment properties, a portfolio of 2,458 residential rental homes, one hotel property, one office/retail development property, two investments in 25 acres of undeveloped land, and two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 800 developable acres). Our consolidated real estate properties had a total estimated value of 1,823.6 million as of September 30, 2022. These properties had a total cost basis of 1,428.4 million as of September 30, 2022, which is the total of acquisition prices of 1,275.2 million, 18.7 million for the acquisition of minority interests in entities, 122.3 million in capital expenditures, leasing commissions and tenant improvements since inception and 12.2 million of acquisition fees and expenses including foreclosure costs and certain costs related to the merger Merger of Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. POSOR II with a subsidiary of ours on October 5, 2020. Our consolidated real estate value compared to this cost basis represents an increase of approximately 27.7 . 
 We obtained appraisals for each of the consolidated real estate properties except for the residential home portfolio which was valued as described above. Our consolidated Appraised Properties had a total appraised value of 1,380.4 million, and our consolidated residential home portfolio had a total estimated value of 443.2 million. 
 For the appraisals, Kroll and Colliers used various methodologies, as appropriate, such as the direct capitalization approach, discounted cash flow analyses and sales comparison approach. Kroll relied primarily on 10-year discounted cash flow analyses for the final valuations of each of the real estate properties (which exclude undeveloped land) and Colliers relied primarily on the sales comparison approach for the final valuations of the undeveloped land that it appraised. Kroll calculated the discounted cash flow value of our real estate properties (which exclude undeveloped land) using property-level cash flow estimates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates that fall within ranges they believe would be used by similar investors to value the properties we own based on recent comparable market transactions adjusted for unique property and market-specific factors. Colliers relied primarily on the sales comparison approach and estimated the value of the undeveloped land based on the most applicable recent comparable market transactions. For the valuation of the residential home portfolio, HouseCanary calculated the total of the estimated value of each individual home using its proprietary automated valuation models. 
 The following table summarizes the key assumptions that were used to value the consolidated Appraised Properties and residential homes: 
 Range in Values Weighted-Average Basis Consolidated Appraised Properties (Excluding Undeveloped Land and Office/Retail Development Property) Terminal capitalization rate 4.25 to 7.75 6.45 Discount rate 6.50 to 9.75 7.67 Net operating income compounded annual growth rate (1) 
 1.60 to 19.07 7.26 Undeveloped Land Price per acre (2) 
 474,000 to 906,000 484,000 Office/Retail Development Property Price per FAR (Floor area ratio) (3) 
 650 to 725 725 Residential Homes Price per square foot 22.09 to 279.09 125.51 _____________________ 
 (1) The net operating income compounded annual growth rates CAGRs reflect both the contractual and market rents and reimbursements (in cases where the contractual lease period is less than the valuation period) net of expenses over the valuation period. The range of CAGRs shown is the constant annual rate at which the net operating income is projected to grow to reach the net operating income in the final year of the hold period for each of the properties. 
 (2) The weighted-average price per acre was primarily driven by our three investments in undeveloped land with approximately 800 developable acres located in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The weighted-average price per acre for these three investments in undeveloped land was approximately 474,000. 
 (3) Price per FAR is before deducting for the ground lease liability and estimated demolition costs, and the range in values reflects different development scenarios. 
 49 

While we believe that Kroll s, Colliers , and HouseCanary s assumptions and inputs are reasonable, a change in these assumptions and inputs would significantly impact the estimated values of our real estate properties and, thus, its estimated value per share. As of September 30, 2022, certain of our real estate assets have non-stabilized occupancies. Appraisals may provide a sense of the value of the investment, but any appraisal of the property will be based on numerous estimates, judgments and assumptions that significantly affect the appraised value of the underlying property. An appraisal of a non-stabilized property, in particular, involves a high degree of subjectivity due to high vacancy levels and uncertainties with respect to future market rental rates and timing of lease-up and stabilization. Accordingly, different assumptions may materially change the appraised value of the property. The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates were adjusted by 25 basis points, and assuming all other factors remain unchanged, with respect to the consolidated Appraised Properties referenced in the table above (excluding undeveloped land and the office/retail development property). Additionally, the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates for these properties were adjusted by 5 in accordance with the IPA guidance: 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 25 basis points Increase of 25 basis points Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Terminal capitalization rates 0.23 (0.23) 0.25 (0.25) Discount rates 0.17 (0.18) 0.25 (0.28) 
 The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the price per acre of the investments in undeveloped land was adjusted by 5 : 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Price per acre (0.20) 0.21 
 The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the price per FAR of the investment in the office/retail development property was adjusted by 5 : 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Price per FAR (0.02) 0.01 
 The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the price per square foot of the residential home portfolio was adjusted by 5 : 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Price per square foot (0.22) 0.23 
 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
 As of September 30, 2022, we held three investments in unconsolidated entities including: 110 William Street, 353 Sacramento, and Pacific Oak Opportunity Zone Fund I. 
 110 William Street is an office property containing 928,157 rentable square feet located in New York, New York and we hold a 60 interest in a joint venture that owns 110 William Street. The appraised value of 110 William Street as provided by Kroll was 441.3 million. Our advisor used the appraised value provided by Kroll, an Advisor adjustment downward to the appraised value to reflect our advisor s judgment that there is the potential to incur higher tenant-required costs at the property where a large lease is currently being negotiated, and our advisor s estimated fair values of other assets and liabilities, to calculate the amount that we would receive in a hypothetical liquidation of the real estate and the other assets and liabilities based on the profit participation thresholds contained in the joint venture agreement. The resulting amount was the fair value assigned to our 60 interest in this unconsolidated joint venture. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our investment in this unconsolidated joint venture were 0 and 59.3 million, respectively. Our carrying value for this investment is 0 due to a 7.8 million distribution from the 110 William Street Joint Venture during the first quarter of 2019 and this distribution exceeded the book value for this investment. 
 50 

Kroll relied on a 10-year discounted cash flow analysis for the final valuation of 110 William Street. The terminal capitalization rate, discount rate and CAGR used in the discounted cash flow model to arrive at the appraised value were 5.25 , 6.25 and 17.91 , respectively. 
 353 Sacramento is an office building containing 284,751 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California and we hold a 55 non-controlling interest in a joint venture that owns 353 Sacramento. The appraised value of 353 Sacramento as provided by Kroll was 236.1 million. Our advisor used the appraised value provided by Kroll along with our advisor s estimated fair values of other assets and liabilities, to calculate the amount that we would receive in a hypothetical liquidation of the real estate and the other assets and liabilities based on the profit participation thresholds contained in the joint venture agreement. The resulting amount was the fair value assigned to our 55 interest in this unconsolidated joint venture. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our investment in this unconsolidated joint venture were 46.6 million and 76.0 million, respectively. 
 Kroll relied on a 10-year discounted cash flow analysis for the final valuation of 353 Sacramento. The terminal capitalization rate, discount rate and CAGR used in the discounted cash flow model to arrive at the appraised value were 5.50 , 7.50 and 17.04 , respectively. 
 The table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates were adjusted by 25 basis points, and assuming all other factors remain unchanged, with respect to 110 William Street and 353 Sacramento. Additionally, the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates for 110 William Street and 353 Sacramento were adjusted by 5 in accordance with the IPA guidance: 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 25 basis points Increase of 25 basis points Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Terminal capitalization rates 0.13 (0.13) 0.14 (0.14) Discount rates 0.08 (0.08) 0.11 (0.11) 
 We also hold 124 Class A Units of Pacific Oak Opportunity Zone Fund I, LLC and the units were valued by our advisor based on our advisor s estimated unit value for the fund. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our investment in this unconsolidated entity were 23.5 million and 38.3 million, respectively, with the latter equal to 0.37 per share. If the per-unit price were adjusted by 5 , it would impact the estimated value per share value by 0.02. 
 Real Estate Equity Securities 
 As of September 30, 2022, we owned investments in three real estate equity securities: 64,165,352 shares of common units of Keppel Pacific Oak US REIT, 6,915,089 shares of Franklin Street Properties Corp, and 613,085 shares of Plymouth Industrial REIT, Inc. The fair values of these real estate equity securities were based on quoted prices in an active market on a major stock exchange. The fair value and carrying value of our real estate equity securities was 63.8 million. 
 Notes Payable 
 The estimated values of our notes payable are equal to the GAAP fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, but they do not equal the book value in accordance with GAAP. For the discounted cash flow analysis, the contractual cash flows were discounted by estimated market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio and type of collateral. 
 The GAAP fair value and carrying value of our notes payable were 720.3 million and 732.7 million, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate applied to the future estimated debt payments, which have a weighted-average remaining term of 1.8 years, was approximately 7.39 . The table below illustrates the impact on our estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by 25 basis points, and assuming all other factors remain unchanged, with respect to our notes payable. Additionally, the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by 5 in accordance with the IPA guidance: 
 Increase (Decrease) on the Estimated Value per Share due to Decrease of 25 basis points Increase of 25 basis points Decrease of 5 Increase of 5 Discount rates (0.03) 0.03 (0.04) 0.04 
 Series B Debentures 
 Our Series B debentures are publicly traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. The estimated value of our Series B debentures is based on the quoted bond price as of September 30, 2022 on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange of 94.4 of face value (including accrued interest expense), and foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the fair value and GAAP carrying value of our Series B debentures were 306.1 million and 310.2 million, respectively. 
 51 

Non-controlling Interests 
 We have an ownership interest in five consolidated entities as of September 30, 2022. As we consolidate these entities, the entire amount of the underlying assets and liabilities are reflected at their fair values in the corresponding line items of the estimated value per share calculation. Given this and the September 30, 2022 appraisal date for the real estate properties, we also must consider the fair value of any non-controlling interest liability as of September 30, 2022. In determining this fair value, we considered the various profit participation thresholds in each of the entities that must be measured in determining the fair value of our non-controlling interest liability. We used the real estate valuations provided by Kroll, Colliers and HouseCanary and calculated the amount that the non-controlling interests would receive in a hypothetical liquidation of the underlying real estate properties (including all current assets and liabilities) at their current estimated values and the payoff of any related debt at its fair value, based on agreements. The estimated payment to the non-controlling interests were then reflected as the non-controlling interest liability in our calculation of its estimated value per share. 
 Participation Fee Potential Liability Calculation 
 Our potential incentive fee payable to our advisor is estimated to be 0 in the estimated share value announced on December 7, 2022. Our advisor is entitled to receive an incentive fee in an amount equal to the amount by which (A) 15.0 of our net cash flows, whether from continuing operations, net sale proceeds or otherwise, which remain after our stockholders have received, together as a collective group, aggregate distributions (including distributions that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes) sufficient to provide (i) a return of their net invested capital, or the amount calculated by multiplying the total number of shares purchased by stockholders by the issue price (except that all shares issued to stockholders of POSOR II in connection with the Merger are deemed to have been purchased by such stockholders at the effective time of the Merger and at a price of 10.63 per share), reduced by any amounts to repurchase shares pursuant to our share redemption program, and (ii) a 7.0 per year cumulative, non-compounded return on such net invested capital from our inception, exceeds (B) 33.8 million which equals (i) the estimated share value effective November 12, 2018 and used in the determination of the number of restricted stock units originally issued, times (ii) the number of restricted stock units originally issued, to our former advisor, KBS Capital Advisors LLC, in connection with its termination on October 31, 2019. Net sales proceeds means the net cash proceeds realized by us after deduction of all expenses incurred in connection with a sale, including disposition fees paid to our advisor. The 7.0 per year cumulative, noncompounded return on net invested capital from our inception is calculated on a daily basis. In making this calculation, the net invested capital is reduced to the extent distributions in excess of a cumulative, noncompounded, annual return of 7.0 are paid (from whatever source), except to the extent such distributions would be required to supplement prior distributions paid in order to achieve a cumulative, noncompounded, annual return of 7.0 (invested capital is only reduced as described in this sentence; it is not reduced simply because a distribution constitutes a return of capital for federal income tax purposes). The 7.0 per year cumulative, noncompounded return is not based on the return provided to any individual stockholder. Accordingly, it is not necessary for each of our stockholders to have received any minimum return in order for our advisor to participate in our net cash flows. In fact, if our advisor is entitled to participate in our net cash flows, the returns of our stockholders will differ, and some may be less than a 7.0 per year cumulative, noncompounded return. This fee is payable only if we are not listed on an exchange. For purposes of determining the estimated value per share, our advisor calculated the potential liability related to this incentive fee based on a hypothetical liquidation of the assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values, after considering the impact of any potential closing costs and fees related to the disposition of real estate properties. 
 Our potential incentive fee payable to Pacific Oak Residential Advisors PORA as it relates to the operations or assets of our subsidiary, PORT is estimated to be 6.8 million in the estimated share value announced on December 7, 2022. For a description of the PORA incentive fee, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 12, 2022.

Other Assets and Liabilities 
 The carrying values of a majority of our other assets and liabilities are considered to equal their fair value due to their short maturities or liquid nature. Certain balances, such as straight-line rent receivables, lease intangible assets and liabilities, accrued capital expenditures, deferred financing costs, unamortized lease commissions and unamortized lease incentives, have been eliminated for the purpose of the valuation due to the fact that the value of those balances were already considered in the valuation of the related asset or liability. Our advisor has also excluded redeemable common stock as temporary equity does not represent a true liability to us and the shares that this amount represents are included in our total outstanding shares of common stock for purposes of calculating the estimated value per share of our common stock. 
 Different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share, and these differences could be significant. The value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets and in response to the real estate and finance markets. 
 Limitations of Estimated Value Per Share 
 As mentioned above, we are providing this estimated value per share to assist broker dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations. This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with IPA valuation guidelines. The estimated value per share set forth above first appeared on the December 31, 2022 customer account statements that were mailed in January 2023. As with any valuation methodology, the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share. The estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to GAAP. 
 Accordingly, with respect to the estimated value per share, we can give no assurance that: 
 
 a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated value per share; 
 a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated value per share upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company; 
 our shares of common stock would trade at the estimated value per share on a national securities exchange; 
 an independent third-party appraiser or other third-party valuation firm would agree with our estimated value per share; or 
 the methodology used to calculate our estimated value per share would be acceptable to FINRA or for compliance with ERISA reporting requirements. 
 Further, the estimated value per share as of December 2, 2022 is based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding, all as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, there were 104,076,881 shares issued and outstanding. The value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets and in response to the real estate and finance markets. The estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed, nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premium/discount versus the sum of the individual property values. The estimated value per share does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not held for sale or under contract for sale, debt prepayment penalties that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt. The estimated value per share does consider any participation or incentive fees that would be due to our advisor based on the aggregate net asset value of ours which would be payable in a hypothetical liquidation of us as of the valuation date in accordance with the terms of our advisory agreement. We currently expect to utilize our advisor and/or an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than December 2023.

 Distribution Information 
 We declare distributions when our board of directors determines we have sufficient cash flow from operations, investment activities and/or strategic financings. We expect to fund distributions from interest and rental income on investments, the maturity, payoff or settlement of those investments and from strategic sales of loans, debt securities, properties and other assets. 
 As a REIT, we will generally have to hold our assets for two years in order to meet the safe harbor to avoid a 100 prohibited transactions tax, unless such assets are held through a TRS or other taxable corporation. In certain instances, we may sell properties outside of the safe harbor period and still be exempt from the 100 prohibited transaction tax because such properties were not held as inventory. Our board of directors intends to declare distributions quarterly depending on cash flow from our investments. Our board of directors may also declare distributions to the extent we have asset sales or receipt of principal payments on our real estate-related investment. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). If we meet the REIT qualification requirements, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the income that we distribute to our stockholders each year. In general, we anticipate making distributions to our stockholders of at least 100 of our REIT taxable income so that none of our income is subject to federal income tax. Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. 
 Our distribution policy is not to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings. However, our organizational documents do not restrict us from paying distributions from any source and do not restrict the amount of distributions we may pay from any source, including proceeds from the issuance of securities, third-party borrowings, advances from our advisor or sponsors or from our advisor s deferral of its fees under the advisory agreement. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits may constitute a return of capital. From time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our taxable income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. In these situations we may make distributions in excess of our cash flow from operations, investment activities and strategic financings to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement described above. In such an event, we would look first to other third party borrowings to fund these distributions.

We have not established a minimum distribution level, and our charter does not require that we make distributions to our stockholders. There were no distributions declared during 2022 and distributions declared during 2021, aggregated by quarter, are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2021 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter (1)

 _____________________ 
 (1) The only distribution declared during the fourth quarter of 2021 was the Special Dividend. See Special Dividend , below. 
 The tax composition of our distribution paid during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: 2022 Ordinary Income Return of Capital 100 Capital Gain Total 100 
 For more information with respect to our distributions paid, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Distributions. 
 Special Dividend 
 On December 28, 2021, our board of directors authorized a special dividend Special Dividend of 1.17 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2021 Record Date ). The Special Dividend was payable in either shares of our common stock or cash to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record as of the Record Date. If stockholders elected all cash, their election would be subject to adjustment such that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed by us would be a maximum of 10 of the total Special Dividend (the Maximum Cash Distribution ), with the remainder to be paid in shares of common stock. The aggregate amount of cash paid by us pursuant to the Special Dividend and the actual number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Special Dividend depended upon the number of stockholders electing cash or stock and whether the Maximum Cash Distribution is met. The Special Dividend was paid in January 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date and consisted of 11.0 million in cash and 99.1 million in shares of common stock. 
 In order to ensure that we maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, we must distribute at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income each year, and distribute all of our real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain in order to avoid corporate level tax. The Special Dividend was made primarily in connection with a deemed sale of land to a taxable REIT subsidiary, which we expected to trigger a significant amount of capital gain in 2021. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other than as previously reported in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Share Redemption Program 
 We have adopted a share redemption program that may enable stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. 
 Pursuant to the share redemption program there are several limitations on our ability to redeem shares: 
 Unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence (each as defined under the share redemption program), we may not redeem shares until the stockholder has held the shares for one year. 
 During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5 of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 
 We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 
 55 

During any calendar year, we may redeem only the number of shares that we can purchase with the amount of net proceeds from the sale of shares under our dividend reinvestment plan during the prior calendar year; provided, however, that this limit may be increased or decreased by us upon ten business days notice to our stockholders. To the extent that we redeem less than the number of shares that we can purchase in any calendar year with the amount of net proceeds from the sale of shares under our dividend reinvestment plan during the prior calendar year plus any additional funds approved by us, such excess capacity to redeem shares during any calendar year shall be added to our capacity to otherwise redeem shares during the subsequent calendar year. Furthermore, during any calendar year, once we have received requests for redemptions, whether in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence , or otherwise, that if honored, and when combined with all prior redemptions made during the calendar year, would result in the amount of remaining funds available for the redemption of additional shares in such calendar year being 1.0 million or less, the last 1.0 million of available funds shall be reserved exclusively for shares being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence. To the extent that, in the last month of any calendar year, the amount of redemption requests in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence is less than the amount of available funds reserved for such redemptions in accordance with the previous sentence, any excess funds may be used to redeem shares not in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence during such month. 
 We may not redeem more than 3.0 million of shares in a given quarter (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence ). To the extent that, in a given fiscal quarter, we redeem less than the sum of (a) 3.0 million of shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence and (b) any excess capacity carried over to such fiscal quarter from a prior fiscal quarter as described below, any remaining excess capacity to redeem shares in such fiscal quarter will be added to our capacity to otherwise redeem shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence during succeeding fiscal quarter. We may increase or decrease this limit upon ten business days notice to stockholders. 
 In addition to the capacity from the point above, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we made available 8.0 million for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death, qualifying disability , or determination of incompetence . As of December 31, 2022, 2.6 million remained available for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death, qualifying disability , or determination of incompetence . Unless an additional amount is approved by us for redemption, in 2023, we may redeem no more than 2.6 million of shares in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence . 
 We may amend, suspend or terminate the program upon ten business days notice to our stockholders. We may provide notice to our stockholders by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we fulfilled redemption requests eligible for redemption under our share redemption program and received in good order and funded redemptions under our share redemption program with the net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan and cash on hand. We redeemed shares pursuant to our share redemption program as follows: Month Total Number 
 of Shares Redeemed

 Paid Per Share (1) 
 Approximate Dollar Value of Shares Available That May Yet Be Redeemed Under the Program January 2022 February 2022 42,430 9.51 (2)

(1) On December 2, 2022, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of 10.50. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2022 redemption date and is effective until the estimated value per share is updated. We expect to update our estimated value per share no later than December 2023. 
 (2) We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under the program as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we redeemed 6.0 million of common stock under the program, which represented shares in connection with redemption requests made upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence . Based on the Twelfth SRP, we have 2.6 million available for redemptions during 2023, subject to the limitations described above. To the extent extra capacity is available with respect to redemptions in the last month of 2023, such capacity will be made available for redemption of shares other than in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence. 

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Also, see Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 We were formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in such manner. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC Pacific Oak Capital Advisors is our advisor and the advisory agreement is currently effective through November 1, 2023; however, we or Pacific Oak Capital Advisors may terminate the advisory agreement without cause or penalty upon providing 60 days written notice. 
 As our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of investments. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors also has the authority to make all of the decisions regarding our investments, except for our residential homes portfolio. Our residential homes portfolio, held through our subsidiary Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc. PORT ), is 
 managed by an affiliate of Pacific Oak Capital Advisors. The advisory duties are subject to the limitations in our charter and the direction and oversight of our board of directors. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. We have sought to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt and equity securities, and other real estate-related investments. We conduct our business primarily through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. 
 On January 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of 140,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 100,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 40,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on November 14, 2012. We sold 56,584,976 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of 561.7 million. Although we offered shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan through March 28, 2023, no shares were issued under the dividend reinvestment plan in 2021 or 2022 and we indefinitely suspended the plan as of March 28, 2023 to minimize administrative costs. On October 5, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT II POSOR II merged with an indirect subsidiary of ours (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of POSOR II s common stock converted into 0.9643 shares of our common stock or 28,973,906 shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had sold 6,851,969 shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of 76.5 million. Also as of December 31, 2022, we had redeemed 27,951,857 of the shares sold in our offering for 324.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had issued 36,398,447 shares of common stock in connection with special dividends. Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, we issued 220,994 shares and 55,249 shares of common stock, respectively, for 2.0 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 On March 2, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI ), our wholly owned subsidiary, filed a final prospectus with the Israel Securities Authority for a proposed offering of up to 1,000,000,000 Israeli new Shekels of Series A debentures (the Series A Debentures at an annual interest rate not to exceed 4.25 . On March 1, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the institutional tender of the Series A Debentures and accepted application for 842.5 million Israeli new Shekels. On March 7, 2016, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the public tender of the Series A Debentures and accepted 127.7 million Israeli new Shekels. In the aggregate, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI accepted 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 249.2 million as of March 8, 2016) in both the institutional and public tenders at an annual interest rate of 4.25 . Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued the Series A Debentures on March 8, 2016. The terms of the Series A Debentures required five equal principal installment payments annually on March 1 st of each year from 2019 to 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI completed the early pay off of all Series A Debentures. 
 
 57 

On February 16, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued 254.1 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 74.1 million as of February 16, 2020) of Series B debentures (the Series B Debentures to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering registered with the Israel Securities Authority. The Series B Debentures bear interest at the rate of 3.93 per year. The Series B Debentures have principal installment payments equal to 33.33 of the face amount of the Series B Debentures on January 31st of each year from 2024 to 2026. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued additional Series B Debentures subsequent to the initial issuance and as of December 31, 2022, 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels (approximately 331.2 million as December 31, 2022) were outstanding. The additional Series B Debentures have an equal level of security, pari passu, amongst themselves and between them and the initial Series B Debentures, which were initially issued, without any right of precedence or preference between any of them. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, two apartment properties, one hotel property, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,456 residential homes, two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 742 developable acres, one office/retail development property and owned three investments in unconsolidated entities and three investments in real estate equity securities. 
 
 Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
 Volatility in global financial markets and changing political environments can cause fluctuations in the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows from investment properties. Increases in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates may cause difficulty in refinancing debt obligations prior to or at maturity or at terms as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Further, increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our debt payments on our variable rate debt to the extent the interest rates on such debt are not limited by interest rate caps. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of real estate investments. Management continuously reviews our investment and debt financing strategies to optimize our portfolio and the cost of our debt exposure. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal demand for funds during the short and long-term is and will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments, payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses, payments under debt obligations, redemptions and purchases of our common stock and payments of distributions to stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, we have had six primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements: 
 Proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering; 
 Proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan; 
 Proceeds from our bond offerings in Israel; 
 Debt financing; 
 Proceeds from the sale of real estate and the repayment of real estate-related investments; and 
 Cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments. 
 We sold 56,584,976 shares of common stock in the primary portion of our initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of 561.7 million. We ceased offering shares in the primary portion of our initial public offering on November 14, 2012. We have indefinitely suspended offering shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan as of March 28, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had sold 6,851,969 shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of 76.5 million. To date, we have invested all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in real estate and real estate-related investments. We intend to use our cash on hand, proceeds from asset sales, proceeds from debt financing, cash flow generated by our real estate operations and real estate-related investments as our primary sources of immediate and long-term liquidity. 
 Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy levels of our properties, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, our office properties were collectively 69 occupied, our residential home portfolio was 94 occupied and our apartment properties were collectively 95 occupied. 
 58 

Our hotel property generates cash flow in the form of room, food, beverage and convention services, campground and other revenues, which are reduced by hotel expenses, capital expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our hotel property is primarily dependent upon the occupancy levels of our hotel, the average daily rates and how well we manage our expenditures. The following table provides summary information regarding our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2022: Property Number of Rooms Percentage Occupied for the year ended December 31, 2022

 _____________________ 
 (1) The Springmaid Beach Resort was sold on September 1, 2022 and the summary information does not represent a full year. 
 Investments in real estate equity securities generate cash flow in the form of dividend income, which is reduced by asset management fees. As of December 31, 2022, we had three investments in real estate equity securities outstanding with a total carrying value of 60.2 million. 
 Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2 of our average invested assets or 25 of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2022 did not exceed the charter-imposed limitation. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our cash needs for capital expenditures, redemptions of common stock and debt servicing were met with proceeds from dispositions of real estate and undeveloped land, proceeds from debt financing, proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan and cash on hand. Operating cash needs during the same period were met through cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments and cash on hand. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of 1.1 billion, with a weighted-average remaining term of 2.1 years. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 412.3 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. In order to satisfy obligations as they mature, we plan to utilize extension options available in the respective loan agreements, may seek to refinance certain debt instruments, may market one or more properties for sale or may negotiate a turnover of one or more secured properties back to the related mortgage lender. Based upon these plans, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance as to the certainty or timing of any of our plans. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and intend to operate as a REIT. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain). Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. We have not established a minimum distribution level. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, two apartment properties, one hotel property, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,456 residential homes, two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 742 developable acres, one office/retail development property and owned three investments in unconsolidated entities and three investments in real estate equity securities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was 10.9 million. We expect that our cash flows from operating activities will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space that is currently unoccupied and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments. However, our cash flows from operating activities may decrease to the extent that we dispose of additional assets. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and primarily consisted of the following: 
 Proceeds from sale of real estate of 151.2 million; 
 Improvements to real estate of 31.1 million; 
 Contributions to unconsolidated entities of 23.8 million; 
 Earnest money received of 17.0 million related to the pending sale of Park Highlands land; 
 Proceeds from advances due from affiliates of 8.2 million; 
 Funding of 7.9 million for development obligations related to Park Highlands land; and 
 59 

Acquisitions of real estate of 6.7 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and consisted primarily of the following: 
 16.9 million of cash used to redeem noncontrolling cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock; 
 11.0 million of of cash distributions paid; 
 9.5 million of distributions paid to noncontrolling interests; 
 9.0 million of net cash used for principal payments on notes payable of 192.3 million and payments of deferred financing costs of 4.8 million and partially offset by proceeds from notes payable of 188.1 million; 
 6.7 million of cash used to redeem noncontrolling interest; and 
 6.0 million of cash used for redemptions of common stock. 
 In order to execute our investment strategy, we utilize secured debt and we may, to the extent available, utilize unsecured debt, to finance a portion of our investment portfolio. Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinancing and interest risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment. Our charter limits our total liabilities such that our total liabilities may not exceed 75 of the cost of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2022, our borrowings and other liabilities were both approximately 70 of the cost (before depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 
 On February 16, 2020, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued 254.1 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately 74.1 million as of February 16, 2020) of Series B debentures (the Series B Debentures to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering registered with the Israel Securities Authority. The Series B Debentures bear interest at the rate of 3.93 per year. The Series B Debentures have principal installment payments equal to 33.33 of the face amount of the Series B Debentures on January 31st of each year from 2024 to 2026. Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI issued additional Series B Debentures subsequent to the initial issuance and as of December 31, 2022, 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels (approximately 331.2 million as December 31, 2022) were outstanding. The additional Series B Debentures have an equal level of security, pari passu, amongst themselves and between them and the initial Series B Debentures, which were initially issued, without any right of precedence or preference between any of them. 
 In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use or have used our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and our dealer manager. During our offering stage, these payments included payments to our dealer manager for selling commissions and dealer manager fees related to sales in our primary offering and payments to our dealer manager and our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and other offering expenses related both to the primary offering and the dividend reinvestment plan. During our acquisition and development stage, we have continued to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us as well as for any dispositions of assets (including the discounted payoff of non-performing loans). 
 The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our conflicts committee. 
 Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75 of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment, inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire or fund such investment and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation. With respect to investments in real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75 of the sum of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property, and inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire such investment. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee will be determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment, inclusive of our proportionate share of any fees and expenses related thereto. 
 60 

Investments made in or through PORT are excluded from the calculation of the asset management fee we pay to our advisor. In addition to other fees described in the advisory agreement between PORT and PORA, PORT pays PORA a quarterly asset management fee equal to 0.25 (1.0 annually) on the aggregate value of PORT s assets, as determined in accordance with PORT s valuation guidelines, as of the end of each quarter. 

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
 The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): Payments Due During the Years Ending December 31, Contractual Obligations Total 2023 2024-2025 2026-2027 Thereafter Outstanding debt obligations (1)

 (1) Amounts include principal payments only. 
 (2) Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates, foreign currency rates and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022. We incurred interest expense of 48.5 million, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs of 3.7 million and unrealized gains on interest rate caps of 1.5 million and including interest capitalized of 2.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 As of December 31, 2021, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of four office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, two apartment properties, two hotel properties, one residential home portfolio consisting of 1,814 residential homes and two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 800 developable acres, one office/retail development property and owned four investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and three investments in real estate equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, we consolidated eight office properties, one office portfolio consisting of two office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, two apartment properties, one hotel property, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,456 residential homes, two investments in undeveloped land with approximately 742 developable acres, one office/retail development property and owned three investments in unconsolidated entities and three investments in real estate equity securities. 
 Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 may not be indicative of those in future periods due to acquisition and disposition activities. Additionally, the occupancy in our office properties has not been stabilized. As of December 31, 2022, our office properties were collectively 69 occupied, our residential home portfolio was 94 occupied and our apartment properties were 95 occupied. However, due to the amount of near-term lease expirations, we do not put significant emphasis on annual changes in occupancy (positive or negative) in the short run. Our underwriting and valuations are generally more sensitive to terminal values that may be realized upon the disposition of the assets in the portfolio and less sensitive to ongoing cash flows generated by the portfolio in the years leading up to an eventual sale. There are no guarantees the occupancy of our assets will increase, or that we will recognize a gain on the sale of our assets. In general, we expect that our income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space and acquiring additional assets but decrease due to disposition activity.

 _____________________ 
 (1) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 attributable to the real estate and real estate related investments acquired, repaid or disposed on or after January 1, 2021. 
 (2) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 with respect to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us during the entirety of both periods presented. 
 Rental income decreased from 123.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the disposition of City Tower, which attributed 8.6 million of rental income during 2021, an overall decrease in occupancy rates related to properties held throughout both periods and partially offset by properties acquired in 2022, including assets acquired as part of the PORT II consolidation. Annualized base rent per square foot related to office properties held throughout both periods were consistent. We expect rental income to increase in future periods as a result of owning the properties acquired during 2022 for an entire period, leasing additional space and to the extent we acquire additional properties, but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. The occupancy of our office properties, collectively, held throughout both periods decreased from 73 as of December 31, 2021 to 69 as of December 31, 2022. 
 Hotel revenues slightly decreased from 30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the disposition of the Springmaid Beach Resort during the year ended December 31, 2022 and partially offset by the increase in occupancy from 47.8 to 62.5 and average daily rate from 139.56 to 190.55 for the Q C Hotel. 
 Dividend income from real estate equity securities decreased from 9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a reduction in quarterly dividends related to our investment in the FSP equity securities. We expect dividend income from real estate equity securities to vary in future periods as a result of the timing of dividends declared and investment activity. 
 62 

Property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance increased from 42.5 million and 20.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 44.3 million and 21.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of properties acquired in 2022 and partially offset by the disposition of City Tower, which attributed to a 2.0 million decrease. We expect property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance to increase in future periods to the extent we acquire additional properties, increasing occupancy of our real estate assets and general inflation, but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Hotel expenses decreased from 21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the Springmaid Beach Resort disposition on September 1, 2022 and partially offset by the increase in occupancy from 47.8 to 62.5 for the Q C Hotel. 
 Asset management fees decreased from 14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of properties disposed in 2021 and 2022 and partially offset by acquisitions in 2022. We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of capital expenditures and to the extent we acquire additional properties, but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 General and administrative expenses increased from 9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased accounting and advisory expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in future periods based on investment and disposition activity as well as costs incurred to evaluate strategic transactions. 
 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss, net, increased from 7.4 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a 29.0 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the debentures in Israel. These debentures are denominated in Israeli new Shekels and we expect to recognize foreign transaction gains and losses based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates, but expect our exposure to be limited to the extent that we have entered into foreign currency options and foreign currency collars. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a 1.2 million gain related to the foreign currency option and collars, which is shown net against 8.6 million of foreign currency transaction loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency transaction loss, net. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a 4.1 million loss related to the foreign currency option and collars, which is shown net against 33.1 million of foreign currency transaction gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency transaction (gain) loss, net. 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased from 58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the disposition of City Tower and intangibles that were fully amortized in 2021, which attributed to decreases of 2.4 million and 3.4 million, respectively and partially offset by properties acquired in 2022. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase in future periods to the extent we acquire additional properties, but to decrease as a result of amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations and disposition of properties. 
 Interest expense increased from 40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increasing benchmark rates affecting our variable rate debt, increase in notes payable balance of 86.5 million related to the PORT II consolidation, and partially offset by a decrease in the notes payable balance of 53.1 million related to the disposition of the Springmaid Beach Resort. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rate fluctuations, the amount of interest capitalized and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives and will decrease to the extent we dispose of properties and pay down debt. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized impairment charges of 4.4 million, 11.6 million and 2.5 million on 210 West 31st Street, Oakland City Center and the Springmaid Beach Resort, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized impairment charges of 6.6 million on 210 West 31st Street and 4.4 million on Lincoln Court. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized impairment charges on goodwill of 5.5 million and 2.6 million on Oakland City Center and the Springmaid Beach Resort, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized impairment charges on goodwill of 1.6 million related to Lincoln Court and 1.2 million related to 210 West 31st Street. 
 63 

Loss from unconsolidated entities increased from a loss of 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a loss of 8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture loss of 4.7 million, primarily as a result of the allowance for credit losses. 
 Loss on real estate equity securities was 51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, all of which are unrealized losses on real estate securities held at December 31, 2022. Gain on real estate equity securities was 28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was composed of 25.6 million unrealized gain on real estate securities held at December 31, 2021 and a 3.0 million realized gain on real estate securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two office properties, one hotel and approximately 67 acres of developable land and recognized a gain on sale of real estate of 46.5 million. Additionally, due to the sale of the 67 acres of developable land, we recognized an income tax provision of 4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold one office property and approximately 193 acres of developable land and recognized a gain on sale of real estate of 30.3 million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 2.4 million related to the forgiveness of the Q C Hotel and Springmaid Beach Resort PPP loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 4.8 million, which is primarily related to the early payoff of the Series A Debentures of 6.7 million and partially offset by the forgiveness of the Springmaid Beach Resort PPP loan of 1.3 million and the payoff of the 1180 Raymond Bond of 0.8 million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we consolidated PORT II and recognized a gain from consolidation of previously unconsolidated entity of 18.7 million. 
 For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Modified Funds from Operations 
 We believe that funds from operations FFO is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT definition. FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition, we elected the option to exclude mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities in the calculation of FFO. We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs. However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
 64 

Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO. As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations MFFO as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability. MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses (to the extent that such fees and expenses have been recorded as operating expenses); adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges. We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives IPA in November 2010 as interpreted by management. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do. 
 In addition, our management uses an adjusted MFFO Adjusted MFFO as an indicator of our ongoing performance, as well as our dividend sustainability. Adjusted MFFO provides adjustments to reduce MFFO related to operating expenses that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land and to increase MFFO related to subordinated performance fee due upon termination to affiliate. 
 We believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are helpful as measures of ongoing operating performance because they exclude costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Management believes that excluding acquisition costs, prior to our early adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 on January 1, 2017, from MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage. MFFO and Adjusted MFFO also exclude non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue. Additionally, we believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provide investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance. MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies. MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. 
 FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP. Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above. Accordingly, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance. In addition, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity. We believe FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures. 
 Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent, the amortization of above- and below-market leases, the amortization of discounts and closing costs, acquisition fees and expenses (as applicable), mark to market foreign currency transaction adjustments, extinguishment of debt, gains from consolidation of unconsolidated entities, and impairment of goodwill are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented. We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
 Adjustments for straight-line rent. These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period; 
 Amortization of above- and below-market leases. Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue. Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate; 
 65 

Transaction and related costs. Transaction and related costs related to business combinations are expensed when incurred. Additionally, previously capitalized offering costs were expensed due to termination of the NAV REIT conversion. We exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. We believe this exclusion is useful to investors as it allows investors to more accurately evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance; 
 Amortization of premium or discount on bond and notes payable. These are adjustments to interest expense as required by GAAP to recognize bond and notes payable discount and premiums on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective bond or notes payable. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our bond and notes payable and related interest expense; 
 Loss or gain on extinguishment of debt. A loss or gain on extinguishment of debt, which includes prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt, represents the difference between the carrying value of any consideration transferred to the lender in return for the extinguishment of a debt and the net carrying value of the debt at the time of settlement. We have excluded the loss or gain from extinguishment of debt in our calculation of MFFO because these losses or gains do not impact the current operating performance of our investments and do not provide an indication of future operating performance; and 
 Mark-to-market foreign currency transaction adjustments. The U.S. Dollar is our functional currency. Transactions denominated in currency other than our functional currency are recorded upon initial recognition at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at each reporting date into the foreign currency at the exchange rate on that date. In addition, we have entered into foreign currency collars and foreign currency options that results in a foreign currency transaction adjustment. These amounts can increase or reduce net income. We exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis; 
 Gain from measurement of prior equity interest. A gain from measurement of prior equity interest, represents a fair value gain on our previous investment in shares of Battery Point Series A-3 Preferred Stock that was eliminated during the acquisition of Battery Point. We have excluded the gain from measurement of prior equity interest in our calculation of MFFO because these gains do not impact the current operating performance of our investments and do not provide an indication of future operating performance; and 
 Gain from consolidation of previously unconsolidated entity. The gain was recognized as part of a consolidation process of a previously unconsolidated entity, where we became the primary beneficiary. We excluded the gain from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 
 Adjusted MFFO includes adjustments to reduce MFFO related to real estate taxes, income tax provision, impairment of goodwill, property insurance and financing costs which are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land. We have included adjustments for the costs incurred necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, as these costs are recurring operating costs that are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net income (loss), FFO and MFFO. 
 66 

Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculations of MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands). No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.

 (1) Reflects an adjustment to eliminate loss or gain on sale of real estate, which includes undepreciated land sales. 
 (2) Reflects adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interest holders share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO. 
 (3) Reflects adjustments to add back our noncontrolling interest share of the adjustments to convert our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO for our equity investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 (4) Reflects real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land. During the periods in which we are incurring costs necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, certain normal recurring operating costs are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net income (loss), FFO and MFFO. 
 FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to improve in future periods to the extent that we continue to lease up vacant space and acquire additional assets. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to decrease as a result of dispositions.

Distributions 
 Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flows provided by operations related to common stockholders were as follows during 2022 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Distribution Declared Distributions Declared Per Share Distributions Paid Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Operations Period Cash Reinvested Total First Quarter 2022 
 11,016 99,094 110,110 315 Second Quarter 2022 
 12,016 Third Quarter 2022 
 (3,671) Fourth Quarter 2022 
 2,208 11,016 99,094 110,110 10,868 
 On December 28, 2021, our board of directors authorized a special dividend of 1.17 per share of common stock payable in either shares of our common stock or cash to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record as of December 30, 2021. The special dividend was paid in January 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date. If stockholders elected all cash, their election was subject to adjustment such that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed by us will be a maximum of 10 of the total special dividend, with the remainder to be paid in shares of common stock. The aggregate amount of cash paid by us pursuant to the special dividend and the actual number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the special dividend depended upon the number of stockholders who elected cash or stock and whether the maximum cash distribution was met. 
 Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 41.4 million and cash flow provided by operations was 10.9 million. Our cumulative distributions paid and net loss attributable to common stockholders from inception through December 31, 2022 was 495.8 million. We have funded our cumulative distributions paid, which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders, with prior period cash flow from operating activities in excess of distributions paid and with cash from gains realized from the disposition of properties. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales, we will have fewer funds available for investment in real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.

Real Estate 
 Real Estate Acquisition Valuation 
 As a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business , acquisitions of real estate beginning January 1, 2017 could qualify as asset acquisitions (as opposed to business combinations). We record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination or an asset acquisition. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, then the set is not a business. For purposes of this test, land and buildings can be combined along with the intangible assets for any in-place leases and accordingly, most acquisitions of investment properties would not meet the definition of a business and would be accounted for as an asset acquisition. To be considered a business, a set must include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contributes to the ability to create an output. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For asset acquisitions, the cost of the acquisition is allocated to individual assets and liabilities on a relative fair value basis. Acquisition costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized. 
 Intangible assets include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized, as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject to lease-up. Acquired in-place lease value will be amortized to expense over the average remaining terms of the respective in-place leases, including any below-market renewal periods. 
 We assess the acquisition date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers, generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that applies appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 
 We record above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using a discount that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of above-market in-place leases and for the initial term plus any extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. We amortize any recorded above-market or below-market lease values as a reduction or increase, respectively, to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective lease, including any below-market renewal periods. 
 We estimate the value of tenant origination and absorption costs by considering the estimated carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, considering current market conditions. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods. 
 We amortize the value of tenant origination and absorption costs to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the leases. 
 Estimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact the amount of our net income. 
 Direct investments in undeveloped land or properties without leases in place at the time of acquisition are accounted for as an asset acquisition and not as a business combination. Acquisition fees and expenses are capitalized into the cost basis of an asset acquisition. Additionally, during the time in which we are incurring costs necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, certain costs such as legal fees, real estate taxes and insurance and financing costs are also capitalized. 
 
 69 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 Real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. We consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Expenditures for tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the tenant s lease term or expected useful life. We anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class to be generally as follows: Land N/A Buildings 25-40 years Building Improvements 10-40 years Tenant Improvements Shorter of lease term or expected useful life Tenant origination and absorption costs Remaining term of related leases, including below-market renewal periods Real estate subsidies tax abatements Remaining term of agreement Furniture, fixtures equipment 3-12 years 
 Impairment of Real Estate and Related Intangibles 
 We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangibles may not be recoverable or realized. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangibles may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangibles through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangibles, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangibles. Consequently, we recognized impairment charges of 18.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 for changes to the fair value of the real estate and related intangibles impairment testing purposes. 
 Projecting future cash flows involves estimating expected future operating income and expenses related to the real estate and its related intangibles as well as market and other trends. Using inappropriate assumptions to estimate cash flows could result in incorrect fair values of the real estate and its related intangibles and could result in the overstatement of the carrying values of our real estate and related intangibles and an overstatement of our net income. 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 We continually assess whether there has been a triggering event requiring a review of goodwill. Independent appraisal valuations were performed as of September 30, 2022 for the underlying properties and we updated projected cash flows for real estate held in certain reporting units. The appraisals and projected cash flow decline represented a triggering event in the fourth quarter of 2022 to the estimated fair value of goodwill. Consequently, we recognized impairment charges of 8.1 million for changes to the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. 
 We concluded that the estimated fair value for all of the other reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their related carrying values and no further impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2022. 
 The carrying value of each reporting unit for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test is determined by considering the reporting units appraisals, 3-year NOI projections and other macroeconomic factors related to the reporting units. In estimating the fair value of reporting units, we applied a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, consideration is given to price to projected appraised value for similarly comparable real estate assets and prices paid in recent transactions that have occurred in its geographical area. Under the income approach, a discount rate is applied that reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit s projected net operating income, which was determined by our asset management team. In determining the estimated fair value, we relied upon the latest 3-year NOI projections, which included significant management assumptions and estimates based on our view of current and future economic conditions. Estimates of our future earnings potential, and that of the reporting units, involve considerable judgment, including management s view on future changes in market cycles, the return-to-work environment, the anticipated result of the office sector, competitive factors and assumptions concerning the market conditions. 
 We engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the valuation of certain reporting units. The results of the impairment evaluation of each reporting unit s goodwill would be significantly impacted by adverse changes in the underlying parameters used in the valuation process. If actual outcomes or the future outlook adversely differ from management s best estimates of the key economic assumptions and associated cash flows applied in the valuation of the reporting unit, we could potentially incur material impairment charges in the future.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity, fund distributions and to fund the refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We may also be exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the acquisition and origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and the acquisition of real estate securities. We are also exposed to the effects of foreign currency changes in Israel with respect to the 3.93 Series B Debentures issued to investors in Israel. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes and foreign currency changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We may manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. In order to limit the effects of changes in foreign currency on our operations, we may utilize a variety of foreign currency hedging strategies such as cross currency swaps, forward contracts, puts or calls. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. Additionally, certain of these strategies may cause us to fund a margin account periodically to offset changes in foreign currency rates which may also reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock. 
 The table below summarizes the notional amounts and average strike rates of our derivative instruments and outstanding principal balance and the weighted average interest rates for our notes and bonds payable for each category based on the maturity dates as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Maturity Date Total Value 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Fair Value Assets Interest rate caps, notional amount 122,788 53,758 176,546 2,267 Strike rate (1) 
 3.5 to 4.0 2.5 2.5 to 4.0 Liabilities Notes and Bonds Payable, principal outstanding Fixed rate - notes payable 17,962 51,303 164,224 233,489 218,951 Average interest rate (2) 
 4.6 4.7 4.0 4.2 Fixed rate - debentures 110,404 110,404 110,405 331,213 304,758 Average interest rate (2)

 6.5 7.0 6.6 
 _____________________ 
 (1) The strike rate caps one-month LIBOR and SOFR on the applicable notional amount. 
 (2) Average interest rate is the weighted-average interest rate. Weighted-average interest rate as of December 31, 2022 is calculated as the actual interest rate in effect at December 31, 2022 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of contractual floor rates, if applicable), using interest rate indices at December 31, 2022, where applicable. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held 113.7 million Israeli new Shekels and 24.6 million Israeli new Shekels in cash and restricted cash, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had bonds outstanding and the related interest payable in the amounts of 1.2 billion Israeli new Shekels and 19.1 million Israeli new Shekels, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Based solely on the remeasurement for the year ended December 31, 2022, if foreign currency exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 , our net income would increase or decrease by approximately 27.0 million and 33.0 million, respectively, for the same period. The foreign currency transaction income or loss as a result of the change in foreign currency exchange rates does not take into account any gains or losses on our foreign currency collar as a result of such change, which would reduce our foreign currency exposure. 
 72 

We borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI Series B Debentures was 304.8 million and the outstanding principal balance was 331.2 million. As of December 31, 2022, excluding the Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI Series B Debentures, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 219.0 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was 233.5 million. The fair value estimate of our Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity BVI Series B Debentures were calculated using the quoted bond price as of December 31, 2022 on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange of 93.7 Israeli new Shekels, respectively. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of December 31, 2022. As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting changes in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations. 
 Conversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but would not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments. As of December 31, 2022, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 501.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into three interest rate caps with a notional amount of 176.5 million that effectively limits one-month LIBOR and SOFR at a range of 2.5 to 4.0 with maturity dates between May 2023 and April 2024. Based on interest rates as of December 31, 2022, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher or lower during the 12 months ending December 31, 2022, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by 3.3 million and 6.3 million, respectively. 
 The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 were 4.1 and 6.6 , respectively. The interest rate and weighted-average interest rate represent the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2022 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of contractual floor rates, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2022 where applicable. 
 We are exposed to financial market risk with respect to our real estate equity securities. Financial market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in our real estate equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in real estate equity security prices is a result of our investment in these types of securities. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, therefore, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market prices of a real estate equity security may result from any number of factors, including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, interest rates, default rates and general market conditions. In addition, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the real estate equity security being sold. We do not currently engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our real estate equity security price risk. As of December 31, 2022, we owned real estate equity securities with a book value of 60.2 million. Based solely on the prices of real estate equity securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, if prices were to increase or decrease by 10 , our net income would increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately 6.2 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a), Schedule III - Real Estate Assets and Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Real estate impairment 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s real estate held for investment and related intangibles totaled 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company monitors if there are indicators of potential impairment which suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable. If indicators are present, the Company tests for recoverability by comparing the expected future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset group. If, based on this analysis, the assets are not believed to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded 18.5 million of impairment related to its real estate held for investment and related intangibles. 
 
 Auditing the Company s real estate impairment assessment was challenging due to the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s identification of indicators of potential impairments and the resulting measurement of impairment when the investment is not deemed recoverable. In particular, the impairment indicators were based on qualitative and quantitative factors for the specific real estate investments. Such factors include, but were not limited to, assessment of management s intended hold period and disposition strategy, a significant decrease in the market price of a real estate investment, a significant decline in expected operating cash flows, current industry and market trends, and other factors including bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. Management s impairment measurement is sensitive to significant assumptions such as market comparables, discount rates, capitalization rates, and revenue growth rates, all of which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We performed audit procedures to test management s identification of events or changes in circumstances that might indicate that the carrying amount of a real estate investment might not be recoverable, and to test management s assessment of the severity of such indicators for each real estate investment. Such procedures include, among others, obtaining evidence to corroborate management s judgments and searching for contrary evidence such as significant declines in operating results, market and economic trends, disposition strategies, natural disasters, or market effects. To test management s assessment of fair value of the real estate determined to be impaired, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in the analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and other relevant factors. As part of our procedures, we involved our valuation specialists to evaluate management s judgments as compared to market support.

Liquidity 
 The Company generally finances its real estate investments using notes payable that are typically structured as non-course secured mortgages with maturities of approximately three to , with short term extension options available upon the Company meeting certain debt covenants. Each reporting period management evaluates the Company s ability to continue as a going concern by evaluating conditions and events, including assessing the liquidity needs to satisfy upcoming debt obligations and the ability to satisfy debt covenant requirements. Through the normal course of operations and as further discussed in Note 7, the Company has million of debt obligations coming due over the period from January 1, 2023 through 12-months following the report issuance date. In order to satisfy obligations as they mature, management will evaluate its options and may seek to utilize extension options available in the respective loan agreements, may make partial loan paydowns to meet debt covenant requirements, may seek to refinance certain debt instruments, may sell real estate equity securities to convert to cash to make principal payments, may market one or more properties for sale or may negotiate a turnover of one or more secured properties back to the related mortgage lender and remit payment for any associated loan guarantee. Historically, the Company has successfully refinanced debt instruments or utilized extension options in order to satisfy debt obligations as they come due and has not negotiated a turnover of a secured property back to a lender, though the Company may utilize such option if necessary. Based upon these plans, management believes it will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations as they come due and to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance as to the certainty or timing of any of management s plans. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion.

To the extent that, in the last month of any calendar year, the amount of redemption requests in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence is less than the amount of available funds reserved for such redemptions in accordance with the previous sentence, any excess funds may be used to redeem shares not in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence during such month. 
 The Company may not redeem more than million of shares in a given quarter (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence ). To the extent that, in a given fiscal quarter, the Company redeems less than the sum of (a) million of shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence and (b) any excess capacity carried over to such fiscal quarter from a prior fiscal quarter as described below, any remaining excess capacity to redeem shares in such fiscal quarter will be added to our capacity to otherwise redeem shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence during succeeding fiscal quarter. The Company may increase or decrease this limit upon ten business days notice to stockholders. 
 In addition to the capacity from the bullet above, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s board of directors has made available million for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death, qualifying disability , or determination of incompetence . As of December 31, 2022, million remained available for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death, qualifying disability , or determination of incompetence and ordinary redemptions were fully depleted. Therefore, in 2023, the Company may redeem no more than million of shares in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence. 
 Except for redemptions made upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence , the price at which the Company will redeem shares is of the Company s most recent estimated value per share as of the applicable redemption date. Upon the death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence of a stockholder, the redemption price continued to be equal to the Company s most recent estimated value per share. 
 The Company s board of directors may amend, suspend or terminate the share redemption program with ten business days notice to its stockholders. The Company may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in the Company s annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to its stockholders. 
 The Company records amounts that are redeemable under the share redemption program as redeemable common stock in its consolidated balance sheets because the shares will be mandatorily redeemable at the option of the holder and therefore their redemption will be outside the control of the Company. However, because the amounts that can be redeemed will be determinable and only contingent on an event that is likely to occur (e.g., the passage of time), the Company presents the net proceeds from the current year and prior year DRP, net of current year redemptions, as redeemable common stock in its consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company classifies as liabilities financial instruments that represent a mandatory obligation of the Company to redeem shares. The Company s redeemable common shares are contingently redeemable at the option of the holder. When the Company determines it has a mandatory obligation to repurchase shares under the share redemption program, it will reclassify such obligations from temporary equity to a liability based upon their respective settlement values.

Segments 
 reportable business segments: opportunistic real estate and real estate-related investments, residential homes, and hotel, which is how the Company's management manages the business. In general, the Company intends to hold its investments in opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, the Company s management views opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments and aggregated into reportable business segment. The Company owns residential homes in markets and are all aggregated into reportable business segment due to the homes being stabilized, having high occupancy rates and have similar economic characteristics. Additionally, the Company owned hotel as of December 31, 2022 and is a separate reportable business segment due to the nature of the hotel business with short-term stays.

The resulting real estate impairment charge on Oakland City Center and the sale of Springmaid Beach Resort, resulted in the fair value of the reporting units to be below fair value and the entirety of the goodwill associated to the reporting units to be written off. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, due to a decline in projected cash flows for real estate held in certain reporting units, the Company determined that the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeded the estimated fair value and recognized impairment charges of million. The determination of fair value includes numerous estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. The change in the projected hold period and related decrease in projected cash flows have created additional uncertainty in forecasting the operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analysis. The Company has made reasonable estimates and judgements. The fair value of the Company's reporting units were measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which included projected cash flows, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates.

Broker-dealer transfers will be made effective as of the start of the first business day of a month. 
 Thereafter, such portion of the Distribution Fee may be reallowed by the Dealer Manager to the then-current broker-dealer of record of the Class T Shares, as applicable, if any such broker-dealer of record has been designated (the Servicing Dealer to the extent such Servicing Dealer has entered into a Selected Dealer Agreement or similar agreement with the Dealer Manager Servicing Agreement and such Selected Dealer Agreement or Servicing Agreement with the Servicing Dealer provides for such reallowance. The Dealer Manager may also reallow some or all of the Distribution Fee to other broker-dealers who shall be considered additional Servicing Dealers pursuant to a Servicing Agreement with the Dealer Manager to the extent such Servicing Agreement provides for such reallowance, all in accordance with the terms of such Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dealer Manager will rebate the representative distribution fee and or the dealer distribution fee to the Company with respect to sales of Class T Shares to the extent a Dealer or Servicing Dealer is not eligible to receive such fee, unless the Dealer Manager is serving as the broker dealer of record with respect to such Class T Shares, as applicable. No Distribution Fee is payable with respect to the Class A Shares. 
 The Dealer Manager shall cease receiving the Distribution Fee with respect to any Class T Share, (including fractional shares) held in a stockholder s account at the end of the month in which the Dealer Manager, in conjunction with the transfer agent, determines that total selling commissions, dealer manager fees, placement agent fees and Distribution Fees paid with respect to the Shares held by such stockholder within such account would equal or exceed, in the aggregate, 9.0 (or a lower limit as set forth in the applicable agreement between the Dealer Manager and such Selected Dealer at the time such shares were issued) of the gross proceeds from the sale of such shares (including the gross proceeds of any Shares issued under the DRIP with respect thereto). At the end of such month, each such Class T 
 15 
 EAST 198721002.4 

Share in such account (including Shares in such account purchased through the DRIP or received as a stock dividend) will convert into a number of Class A Shares (including any fractional shares) with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such shares.

 Each investor may agree with the investor s registered representative or Selected Dealer to reduce or eliminate any selling commission payable with respect to the investor s purchase of the Shares. If selling commissions are waived in any particular case, the Company will not pay any selling commissions to the Dealer Manager in respect of the Shares for which the Selected Dealer or investment representative has agreed to waive the fees, which will have the effect of reducing the per share purchase price of Shares purchased by the particular investor. 
 If an investor uses the services of a registered investment advisor and not a Selected Dealer in connection with the purchase of Shares, no selling commissions or dealer manager fees will be payable with respect to the investor s purchase of those Shares, which will have the effect of reducing the per share purchase price of Shares purchased by the particular investor. Any fees or other compensation paid to the registered investment advisor will be the investor s responsibility, not the Company s. The net proceeds to the Company per share will not be affected by the waiver of selling commissions. The payment of any fees or similar compensation to the investment advisor will be the sole responsibility of the investor, and the Company will have no liability for that compensation. 
 The Company will pay any commissions or fees due hereunder solely to the Dealer Manager and it shall be the Dealer Manager s obligation to pay any commissions or fees which it reallows to any Selected Dealer. The Company shall not be obligated and shall have no liability to pay any commissions or fees to any Selected Dealer.

 1.3 Each Selected Dealer will, and each Selected Dealer Agreement will require each Selected Dealer to, severally indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Dealer Manager, each of their officers, managers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Dealer Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (the Selected Dealer Indemnified Persons ), from and against any Losses to which a Selected Dealer Indemnified Person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as the Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (i) in the Private Placement Memorandum or (ii) in any Filing or (iii) in any Authorized Materials, or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Private Placement Memorandum or in any Filing or Authorized Materials a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, provided that clauses (a) and (b) apply, to the extent, but only to the extent, that the untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Dealer Manager by or on behalf of the Selected Dealer specifically for use with reference to the Selected Dealer in the preparation of the Private Placement Memorandum or in any Filing or Authorized Materials or (c) any use of printed materials not authorized or approved by the Company or any use of broker-dealer use only materials with potential investors by the Selected Dealer in the offer and sale of the Securities or any use of printed materials in a particular jurisdiction if the material bears a legend denoting that it is not to be used in connection with the sale of Securities in the applicable jurisdiction or (d) any untrue statement made by the Selected Dealer or its representatives or agents or omission to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities or (e) any material violation of this Agreement or the Selected Dealer Agreement entered into between the Dealer Manager and the Selected Dealer or (f) any failure to comply with applicable laws governing privacy issues, money laundering abatement and anti-terrorist financing efforts, including applicable rules of the SEC, FINRA and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 or (g) any other failure to comply with applicable rules of FINRA or federal or state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

The failure of an indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party will relieve the indemnifying party from any liability under this Section 6 as to the particular item for which indemnification is then being sought, but not from any other liability that it may have to any indemnified party. In case any action is brought against any indemnified party, and the indemnified party notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to participate in the defense thereof, with separate counsel provided that the indemnifying party shall not be relieved of the obligation to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable legal and other expenses (subject to Section 6.5) incurred by the indemnified party in defending itself, except for those expenses incurred

No indemnified party shall be bound to perform or refrain from performing any act pursuant to the terms of the settlement of any claim or action effected without the consent of the indemnified party. 
 1.5 The indemnifying party shall pay all legal fees and expenses of the indemnified party to defend against any claims or actions provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be obliged to pay legal expenses and fees to more than one law firm in connection with the defense of similar claims arising out of the same alleged acts or omissions giving rise to the claims or actions notwithstanding that the actions or claims are alleged or brought by one or more parties against more than one indemnified party. If the claims or actions are alleged or brought against more than one indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall only be obliged to reimburse the expenses and fees of the one law firm that has been selected by a majority of the indemnified parties against which the action is finally brought and in the event a majority of the indemnified parties are unable to agree on which law firm for which expenses or fees will be reimbursable by the indemnifying party, then payment shall be made to the first law firm of record representing an indemnified party against the action or claim. The law firm shall be paid only to the extent of services performed by the law firm and no reimbursement shall be payable to the law firm on account of legal services performed by another law firm.
