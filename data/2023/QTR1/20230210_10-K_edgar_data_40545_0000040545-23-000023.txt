FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. Our public communications and SEC filings may contain statements related to future, not past, events. These forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," "estimate," "forecast," "target," "preliminary," or "range."

(AerCap) and GE HealthCare, the timing for such transactions, the ability to satisfy any applicable pre-conditions, and the expected proceeds, consideration and benefits to GE; 
 changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, risk of recession, inflation, supply chain constraints or disruptions, rising interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets (including our equity interests in AerCap and GE HealthCare), oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and exchange rates, and the impact of such changes and volatility on our business operations, financial results and financial position; 
 global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks, including impacts from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and other measures, decreases in the rates of investment or economic growth globally or in key markets we serve, or an escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other countries, and related impacts on our businesses' global supply chains and strategies; 
 the continuing severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts of virus variants and resurgences, and of government, business and individual responses, such as continued or new government-imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions, and in particular any adverse impacts to the aviation industry and its participants; 
 our capital allocation plans, including de-leveraging actions to reduce GE's indebtedness, the capital structures of the public companies that we plan to form from our businesses with the planned spin-off, the timing and amount of dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, organic investments, and other priorities; 
 downgrades of our current short- and long-term credit ratings or ratings outlooks, or changes in rating application or methodology, and the related impact on our funding profile, costs, liquidity and competitive position; 
 the amount and timing of our cash flows and earnings, which may be impacted by macroeconomic, customer, supplier, competitive, contractual and other dynamics and conditions; 
 capital and liquidity needs associated with our financial services operations, including in connection with our run-off insurance operations and mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH), the amount and timing of any required capital contributions and any strategic actions that we may pursue; 
 market developments or customer actions that may affect demand and the financial performance of major industries and customers we serve, such as demand for air travel and other aviation industry dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic; pricing, cost, volume and the timing of investment by customers or industry participants and other factors in renewable energy markets; conditions in key geographic markets; technology developments; and other shifts in the competitive landscape for our products and services; 
 operational execution by our businesses, including the success at our Renewable Energy business in improving product quality and fleet availability, executing on cost reduction initiatives and other aspects of operational performance, as well as the performance of GE Aerospace amidst the ongoing market recovery; 
 changes in law, regulation or policy that may affect our businesses, such as trade policy and tariffs, regulation and incentives related to climate change (including the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies), and the effects of tax law changes; 
 our decisions about investments in research and development, and new products, services and platforms, and our ability to launch new products in a cost-effective manner; 
 our ability to increase margins through implementation of operational improvements, restructuring and other cost reduction measures; 
 the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of Alstom, Bank BPH and other investigative and legal proceedings; 
 the impact of actual or potential quality issues or failures of our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated, and related costs and reputational effects; 
 the impact of potential information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches at GE or third parties; and 
 the other factors that are described in the "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as such descriptions may be updated or amended in any future reports we file with the SEC. 
 
 These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.

ABOUT GENERAL ELECTRIC. General Electric Company (General Electric, GE or the Company) is a high-tech industrial company that today operates worldwide through three segments: Aerospace, Renewable Energy, and Power. Our products include commercial and military aircraft engines and systems; wind and other renewable energy generation equipment and grid solutions; and gas, steam, nuclear and other power generation equipment. We have significant global installed bases of equipment across these sectors, and services to support these products are also an important part of our business alongside new equipment sales. 
 
 In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from (i) our Aerospace business, (ii) our Renewable Energy, Power, Digital and Energy Financial Services businesses, which we plan to combine and refer to as GE Vernova, and (iii) our former HealthCare business. In July 2022, we announced the new brand names for our three planned future companies: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare and GE Vernova. For purposes of this report, we refer to our reporting segments as Aerospace (previously Aviation), HealthCare (previously Healthcare), Renewable Energy and Power. The composition of these reporting segments is unchanged. On January 3, 2023, we completed the separation of the HealthCare business from GE through the spin-off of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare). In the spin-off, GE made a pro-rata distribution of approximately 80.1 of the shares of GE HealthCare s common stock to GE shareholders, retaining approximately 19.9 of GE HealthCare common stock. This spin-off marked the culmination of our first business separation in accordance with the November 2021 strategic plan, and we are working toward the planned spin-off of GE Vernova. 
 
 Over our more than 130-year history, GE s innovation and technology have improved quality of life around the world by adapting and innovating solutions to pressing global challenges related to the future of flight, the energy transition and precision healthcare. At GE Aerospace, with a differentiated product and technology portfolio across the commercial and military sectors, we are well positioned to serve customers in expanding and upgrading their fleets amidst the demand ramp for engines and services with the ongoing recovery from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, we are working to develop next generation engine programs that will allow a smarter and more efficient future of flight, including efforts to support increased use of sustainable aviation fuel with our engines capabilities and developing new engine architectures such as open fan, hybrid electric and hydrogen technologies. The GE Vernova portfolio of businesses are positioned to lead the energy transition, helping the energy sector solve for sustainability, reliability and affordability. These businesses are at the center of a dynamic and growing market, as the world faces a significant increase in electricity demand in the coming decades along with the need to electrify and decarbonize. With a range of power generation technologies spanning gas power, onshore and offshore wind and others, as well as power grid automation and hardware, these businesses offer solutions for customers to reduce emissions, meet the growth in electricity demand and make energy more accessible globally, secure and resilient. And GE HealthCare, as an independent company since January 2023, will carry forward its mission of advancing precision care to help solve the healthcare industry s challenges in harnessing data more effectively to provide better outcomes for patients, improving productivity and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites. 
 
 We believe our businesses strategies and focus on these significant global challenges are well aligned with broader goals of sustainable development, and we approach sustainability with GE s commitment to innovation as a central element. Sustainability priorities are embedded in our policies, leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments, and, ultimately, our products. In addition to working to develop technologies that will help build a more sustainable world, we advance GE s sustainability priorities through our own commitments to our people, communities and planet. More information that may be of interest to a variety of stakeholders about GE s sustainability approach, priorities and performance, including about safety, greenhouse gas emission reductions for our own operations and for our products, environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion (as also discussed further below), supply chain and human rights and other matters, can be found in our Sustainability Report. 
 
 In the remainder of this report, we discuss GE on a consolidated basis and its businesses as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2022 unless otherwise indicated. The HealthCare business was a segment included in GE s consolidated results for all of 2022, and accordingly we include GE HealthCare s results and other details for 2022 in this report. The historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the spin-off will be reported in GE's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2023. For the GE Vernova businesses, we continue to refer to our reporting segments of Renewable Energy and Power, reflecting the organization and management of these businesses within GE today. 
 
 We serve customers in 170 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 75 manufacturing plants located in 26 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 130 manufacturing plants located in 32 other countries. 
 
 In all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive environment is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we continue to make improvements through deployment of lean initiatives and we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. 
 
 As a diverse global company, we are affected by economic and market developments around the world, supply chain disruptions, instability in certain regions, commodity prices, foreign currency volatility and policies regarding trade and imports. See the Segment Operations section within MD A for further information. Other factors impacting our business include: 
 product development cycles for many of our products are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success; 
 research and development expenditures are important to our business; 
 many of our products are subject to a number of regulatory standards; and 
 changing end markets, including shifts in energy sources and demand related to cost, decarbonization efforts and other factors, as well as the impact of technology changes. 
 2022 FORM 10-K 4 

The strength and talent of our workforce are critical to the success of our businesses, and we continually strive to attract, develop and retain personnel commensurate with the needs of our businesses in their operating environments. The Company s human capital management priorities are designed to support the execution of our business strategy and improve organizational effectiveness. Our focus on organizational performance and talent will remain front and center through the execution of our strategic plan to separate into three independent companies. We will continue to monitor various factors across our human capital priorities, including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year and with oversight by our Board of Directors and the Board s Management Development and Compensation Committee. The following are our human capital priorities: 
 Protecting the health and safety of our workforce: GE is committed to establishing and maintaining effective health and safety standards and protocols across our businesses, making continuous process improvements, and providing ongoing education. Our Chief Safety Officer, hired in 2021, has continued to advance our Safety Promotion Office and safety program, leveraging lean as a critical tool to prevent injuries and incidents and drive safety as a core operational attribute for the businesses. For the past two years, our annual bonus program for executives has included a modifier based on the Company s safety performance. 
 Sustaining a Company culture based in leadership behaviors of humility, transparency and focus, with a commitment to unyielding integrity: GE s organizational culture supports talent attraction, engagement and retention and promotes ways of working that are strongly connected to our goals. In early 2022, we conducted an annual enterprise-wide culture survey. While survey results varied among our businesses, a Company-wide view of trends in responses confirmed our employees view of GE s solid foundations in safety, compliance, and employee development. Our performance management system, People, Performance, and Growth, directly links individual performance outcomes to incentive compensation. Supporting our culture of integrity, The Spirit The Letter, GE s employee code of conduct, sets forth the Company s integrity and compliance standards. 
 Developing and managing our talent to best support our organizational goals: GE s approach to talent management aims to ensure strong individual and company performance; our employee training and development offerings are designed to support these goals. As a key pillar of our talent strategy, GE s senior management leads an annual organization and talent review for each business to support a strong leadership pipeline and succession planning process for our strategy to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies. To support our lean culture transformation, we have two lean leadership development programs designed to elevate high potential executive level talent who can lead us towards a more sustainable future. Developed in partnership with our existing leaders, our leadership development programs are premised upon a rigorous learning process tied directly to outcomes, with a focus on hands-on, experiential learning and building a lean mindset. 
 Promoting inclusion and diversity across the enterprise: At GE, we are committed to building a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive workplace by focusing on transparency, accountability and community. We believe in the value of each person s unique identity, background and experiences, and are committed to fostering an inclusive culture in which all employees feel empowered to do their best work because they feel accepted, respected and that they belong. In 2022, we disclosed in our Diversity Annual Report our long-standing commitment to fair and competitive pay practices. On average, men and women performing similar work are paid within 1 of each other in each GE business. Going forward, our goal remains 100 pay equity in each of our businesses. 
 
 Additionally, in 2021, we began publishing a Diversity Annual Report to transparently share our diversity data and hold ourselves accountable for continuous improvement. To support our inclusion and diversity goals, we have a GE Chief Diversity Officer and Chief Diversity Officers in each business unit. Additionally, we have several Employee Resource Groups which have added value to our colleagues and businesses by helping to engage and develop diverse talent for nearly 30 years. These groups accelerate development through mentoring, learning, networking, organizing outreach and service activities, and they address challenges that are important to their members and the Company through targeted initiatives. These groups also support our goals to build a diverse talent pipeline through efforts such as partnering with organizations to raise money for scholarship funds and promoting professional development opportunities. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 172,000 people, of whom approximately 58,000 were employed in the United States. Our Aerospace, Renewable Energy, Power, and HealthCare segments employed approximately 45,000, 36,000, 32,000, and 49,000 people, respectively. In addition, Corporate employed approximately 10,000 employees, including legacy GE Capital employees. In connection with the January 3, 2023 spin-off of GE HealthCare, approximately 49,000 of our full-time employees formerly associated with our HealthCare segment became employees of GE HealthCare. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, GE has approximately 5,745 union-represented manufacturing and service employees in the United States. 
 Following the spin-off of GE HealthCare, GE has approximately 4,670 union-represented manufacturing and service employees in the United States. The majority are covered by four-year collective bargaining agreements that were ratified in 2019 and are scheduled to terminate in 2023. GE will hold negotiations to enter into new agreements on or before their termination dates. While the outcome of the 2023 negotiations cannot be predicted, GE s recent past negotiations have resulted in agreements that provide employees with good wages and benefits while addressing the competitive realities facing GE. GE s relationship with employee-representative organizations outside the U.S. takes many forms, including in Europe where GE engages employees representatives bodies such as works councils (at both European level and locally) and trade unions in accordance with local law. 
 2022 FORM 10-K 5 

We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters related to our products, services and business operations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and safety and the environment. Relevant laws and regulations can apply to our business directly and indirectly, such as through the effect that laws and regulations applicable to our customers may have in influencing the products and services they purchase from us. Like other industrial manufacturing companies that operate in the sectors we serve, which are high-tech, increasingly digitally connected and global, we face significant scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governmental authorities with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of the sales across our businesses are also made to U.S. or foreign governments, regulated entities such as public utilities, state-owned companies or other public sector customers, and these types of sales often entail additional compliance obligations. For further information about government regulation applicable to our businesses, see the Segment Operations section within MD A, Risk Factors and Note 24. 
 
 We own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are licensed to others. GE is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company. 
 
 Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A). The consolidated financial statements of General Electric Company are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this MD A are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2022 versus 2021 are discussed within this report. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for discussions of results for the years ended December 31, 2021 versus 2020. The MD A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 
 SUMMARY OF 2022 RESULTS. Total revenues were 76.6 billion, up 2.4 billion for the year, driven primarily by increases at Aerospace and HealthCare, partially offset by decreases at Renewable Energy and Power. 
 
 Continuing earnings (loss) per share was 0.53. Excluding the results from our run-off Insurance business, separation costs, the Steam asset sale impairment, restructuring costs, non-operating benefit costs, debt extinguishment costs, Russia and Ukraine charges, gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests and gains (losses) on equity securities, Adjusted earnings per share was 2.62. For the year ended December 31, 2022, profit margin was 1.8 and profit was up 5.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of 6.1 billion, a decrease in non-operating benefit costs of 2.3 billion, an increase in segment profit of 0.7 billion, a decrease in Adjusted corporate operating costs of 0.5 billion and a decrease in interest and other financial charges of 0.3 billion, partially offset by a decrease in gains on equity securities of 1.8 billion, separation costs of 1.0 billion, the Steam asset sale impairment of 0.8 billion, an increase in restructuring and other charges of 0.5 billion, a decrease in Insurance profit of 0.5 billion and Russia and Ukraine charges of 0.3 billion. Adjusted organic profit increased 1.5 billion (32 ), driven primarily by increases at Aerospace and Power and lower Adjusted corporate operating costs , partially offset by increased losses at Renewable Energy. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 2022 FORM 10-K 6 

Cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) were 5.9 billion and 0.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in cash collateral paid net of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts, an increase in net income (after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, non-cash losses related to our interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes and non-operating debt extinguishment costs), an increase in cash from working capital and an increase in cash from all other operating activities. Free cash flows (FCF) were 4.8 billion and 1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. FCF increased primarily due to the same reasons as noted for CFOA above. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Statement of Cash Flows section for further information.

 Significant Trends Developments. Our results in 2022 reflect the continued recovery of commercial air travel from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. A key underlying driver of our commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which improved 21 during 2022 compared to 2021, and now stands at approximately 90 of 2019 levels. 
 
 The recovery trends vary by region from the travel restrictions imposed by governments and the prevalence of COVID-19 virus variants around the globe. We remain confident in the recovery, and current trends are in line with our recovery forecast. Consistent with updated industry projections, we estimate both narrowbody and widebody air traffic to recover to 2019 levels in late 2023. We are in frequent dialogue with our airline, airframe, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand. 
 
 As it relates to the military environment, we continue to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our Military business as the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. In September 2022, Aerospace and the U.S. Air Force successfully concluded testing on the second XA100 adaptive cycle engine, marking the final major contract milestone of the Air Force s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP). 
 
 Global material availability and labor shortages, in part driven by the pandemic, continue to cause disruptions for us and our suppliers, and have impacted our production and delivery across our businesses. We increased our Commercial and Military engine sales units by 13 in 2022 compared to 2021, and the combined engine sales units increased more than 25 in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022. We continue to partner with our airframe partners on future production rates. Aerospace has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage. 
 
 Total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, increased compared to the prior year. We continue to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. 
 
 We continue to take actions to protect our ability to serve our customers now and as the global airline industry recovers.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, segment revenues were up 4.7 billion (22 and segment profit was up 1.9 billion (66 ). 
 RPO as of December 31, 2022 increased 10.0 billion (8 from December 31, 2021, due to increases in both equipment and services. Equipment increased primarily due to an increase in Commercial and Military orders since December 31, 2021. Services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service and contract modifications. 
 Revenues increased 4.8 billion (23 organically . Commercial Services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and commercial spare part shipments, and higher prices. Commercial Services revenues also increased due to a net favorable change of 0.1 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of 0.3 billion in the prior year. Commercial Engines revenues increased, primarily driven by 176 more commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 291 more LEAP units versus the prior year, partially offset by lower GEnx engine production rates and product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs. Military revenues increased, primarily due to growth in services and 79 more engine shipments than the prior year, partially offset by product mix. 
 Profit increased 1.8 billion (62 organically , primarily due to increased shop visit volume and commercial spare part shipments, higher prices and the impact of favorable contract margin reviews for long-term service agreements. These increases in profit were partially offset by lower profit on Commercial Engine shipments driven by product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs and more shipments on newer programs, inflation in our supply chain and additional growth investment.

 Competition Regulation. While many factors, including government incentives, specific market rules, and permitting regulations and challenges, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. We continue to invest in improving the durability of our wind turbine products, fleet availability and project execution with increased focus on project selectivity. Additionally, we continue to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. As industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy. 
 
 Significant Trends Developments. During the third quarter of 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, introducing new and extending existing tax incentives for 10 years. The IRA is expected to resolve recent U.S. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and deferral of customer investments in Onshore Wind and significantly increase near- and longer-term demand in the U.S. for onshore and offshore wind projects. The timing of this demand growth depends in part on how quickly the IRA incentives are implemented. While the offshore wind industry continues to expect global growth through the decade, cost pressures and the ability to complete with the rapid pace of innovation remain key challenges. Finally, our Grid business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs. 
 
 We have experienced significant cost inflation across all businesses which we expect to continue, and are working to mitigate through pricing and cost actions. At Onshore Wind, based on experience across our fleet, we are deploying repairs and other corrective measures to improve our overall quality and fleet availability resulting in higher warranty and related reserves. Concurrently, we are undertaking a restructuring program to reduce fixed cost, reflecting our selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants. Our financial results are dependent on costs to address fleet availability and quality, execution of cost reduction initiatives and the inflationary environment. Additionally, initiatives to improve selectivity and pricing as well as U.S. Treasury tax implementation guidance related to the IRA are expected to further improve our results.

Competition Regulation. Worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. Demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. Our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. In addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power). 
 
 Significant Trends Developments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, global gas power generation grew mid-single digits and GE gas turbine utilization grew low-single digits with strength in the U.S. Utilization of the fleet continues to follow growing gas power generation, capturing shortfalls from coal retirements, and resilient asset usage with a dynamic Europe environment with the Russia and Ukraine conflict and mild winter. Looking ahead, we anticipate H-class units to be commissioned into the serviceable installed base and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. Power has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage. Although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), we expect the gas market to remain stable over the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. We believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition. We remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have high confidence to deliver for our customers. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for GE Steam Power to sell a portion of its business to lectricit de France S.A. (EDF), which resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed a binding agreement and expect to complete the sale, subject to regulatory approval, in the second half of 2023. In the second quarter of 2022, we announced that Gas Power intends to acquire Nexus Controls, a business specializing in aftermarket control system upgrades and controls field services. The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval and mandatory information and consultation processes with employees and their representatives, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 We continue to invest in new product development, such as our Nuclear small modular reactors and our HA-Turbines, with over 1.6 million operating hours. Our fundamentals remain strong with approximately 69.0 billion in RPO, including 27 HA-Turbines, and a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units, including 78 HA-Turbines, which has nearly doubled since 2019, and approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

 Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx) researches, manufactures and markets innovative imaging agents used during medical scanning procedures to highlight organs, tissue and functions inside the human body, to aid physicians in the early detection, diagnosis and management of disease through advanced in-vivo diagnostics. These products include both contrast imaging and molecular imaging agents. 
 BioPharma This business was sold on March 31, 2020. It delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery, biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies. 
 
 Competition Regulation. HealthCare competes with a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers and services providers. Customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. Key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. New technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. Our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs. 
 
 Significant Trends Developments. Market demand and RPO conversion remain positive despite inflationary and supply challenges continuing to impact the industry. Global spending in healthcare is solid and expected to continue, particularly in public markets across Europe and Asia. We are experiencing strong order growth in our China equipment business due to government stimulus programs. Overall, continued patient demand is leading providers to invest in products and services that increase productivity and reduce operating costs, an important dynamic as healthcare systems modernize post-pandemic and prepare for increased demand longer-term. Actions of our supply chain, engineering and manufacturing teams, as well as proactive supplier engagement are driving fewer delays in securing key materials and have improved our ability to deliver products to our customers. However, shortages are still impacting our ability to deliver certain products. Our expectation is that supply chain pressures will continue to improve. We continue to experience inflationary pressure within our supply chain, however, we have partially offset this pressure by adjusting pricing of our products, as well as managing discretionary and fixed cost in our business and prioritizing research and development investments. 
 
 We continue to grow and invest in precision health, with a focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. We introduced over 40 solutions that aim to improve patient outcomes and increase healthcare efficiency at the Radiological Society of North America s (RSNA) 2022 Annual Meeting. For example, we announced a platform of four inventive components, which are SIGNA One, a new anticipatory user interface with virtually no learning curve; AIR Recon DL; AIR Coils; and automated workflow solutions, that leverage AI and deep learning to ensure the smoothest scanning experience in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In January 2023 we announced we entered into an agreement to acquire IMACTIS, an innovator in the rapidly growing field of computed tomography (CT) interventional guidance across an array of care areas. IMACTIS created CT-Navigation , an ergonomic universal solution that provides stereotactic needle guidance, enabling intuitive pre-planning and continuous control throughout a wide range of procedures, from diagnosis to treatment. We remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient and personalized precision care.

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, segment revenues were up 0.7 billion (4 and segment profit was down 0.3 billion (9 ). 
 RPO as of December 31, 2022 decreased 0.2 billion (1 from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the impact of contract renewal timing in services, partially offset by an increase in equipment orders. 
 Revenues increased 1.3 billion (7 organically . Equipment revenues increased, driven by Imaging and Ultrasound, mainly due to strong growth in the U.S. and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, partially offset by China. Services revenues increased, driven by the continued growth of HCS and PDx. 
 Profit decreased 0.1 billion (2 organically , driven by increased material inflation and logistics cost across all product lines, partially offset by increased volume and price. We also continued to make planned research and development and commercial investments. 

CORPORATE. The Corporate amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of intersegment activities. In addition, the Corporate amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, and other costs reported in Corporate. 
 
 Corporate includes the results of the GE Digital business and our remaining GE Capital businesses, our former financial services business, including our run-off Insurance business (see Other Items - Insurance for further information) and the Lighting segment through its disposition in the second quarter of 2020.

 Adjusted total corporate operating costs excludes gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, impairments and our run-off Insurance business profit. We believe that adjusting corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 2022 FORM 10-K 14 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, r evenues increased by 0.2 billion due to 0.5 billion of lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by 0.2 billion of lower revenue in our run-off Insurance business and 0.1 billion of lower revenue in our Digital business. Corporate operating profit decreased by 4.3 billion due to 1.8 billion of lower gains on equity securities, primarily related to our AerCap and Baker Hughes investments. Corporate operating profit also decreased as the result of 1.0 billion of separation costs and 0.5 billion of lower operating profit in our run-off Insurance business, primarily due to a charge related to terminating several reinsurance contracts (see Other Items - Insurance). In addition, operating profit decreased due to 0.8 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a result of reclassification of a portion of our Steam Power business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022 (see Notes 6 and 7). Corporate operating profit also decreased due to 0.5 billion of higher restructuring and other charges primarily related to our Corporate segment and 0.3 billion of charges from contracts and recoverability of assets in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting sanctions, primarily within our Aerospace and Power businesses. These decreases were partially offset by 0.1 billion of lower losses on purchases and sales of business interests due to a 0.2 billion held for sale loss within our Power segment in 2021. 
 Adjusted total corporate operating costs decreased by 0.5 billion primarily as the result of 0.3 billion of lower functional costs and 0.2 billion of lower costs associated with EHS and other items primarily driven by core reductions and favorability from interest rate and foreign exchange dynamics. 

OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION 
 RESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS. Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. See Note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs. 
 
 INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES were 1.6 billion, 1.9 billion and 2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations. Inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were 1.7 billion, 2.5 billion and 3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings. 
 
 DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COSTS were 0.5 billion, 6.5 billion and 0.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 
 2020, respectively. During 2022, we executed a debt tender in the fourth quarter and incurred debt extinguishment costs of 
 0.5 billion in the same quarter. The majority of these costs relate to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. As a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward. 
 
 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. Refer to Note 13 for information about our pension and retiree benefit plans. 
 
 INCOME TAXES 2022 2021 2020 Effective tax rate (ETR) 33.7 7.8 (8.2) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 476 (286) (487) Cash income taxes paid(a) 1,128 1,330 1,291 
 (a) Included taxes paid related to discontinued operations. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 , the income tax rate was 33.7 compared to 7.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The tax rate for 2022 reflects tax expense on pre-tax income. The tax rate for 2021 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. 
 
 The provision (benefit) for income taxes was 0.5 billion and (0.3) billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in tax was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefit associated with lower debt extinguishment costs 0.4 billion), the nonrecurrence of tax benefits associated with internal restructurings to recognize deductible stock and loan losses in excess of the amount offsetting AerCap and Baker Hughes tax in 2021 0.2 billion) and the increase in pre-tax income excluding debt extinguishment and the net gains in 2022 on our interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes 0.2 billion). There was an insignificant tax effect on the net gains in AerCap and Baker Hughes in both periods because of available capital losses. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the adjusted income tax rate was 21.6 compared to 20.2 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The adjusted income tax rate increased primarily due to larger non-U.S. losses without a tax benefit. 
 
 Absent additional taxes on global income enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. tax reform) and non-U.S. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-U.S. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the U.S. statutory tax rate. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 2022 FORM 10-K 15 

The rate of tax on our profitable non-U.S. earnings is below the U.S. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the U.S. statutory rate and because GE funds certain non-U.S. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Given U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without additional U.S. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the U.S. would potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in connection with the execution of the Company s plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we incurred 0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings. 
 
 A substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-U.S. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the U.S. statutory rate is derived from our Aerospace operations located in Singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8 and our Power operations located in Switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 17.4 and 18.6 . 
 
 The rate of tax on non-U.S. operations is increased, however, because we have losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses. Non-U.S. losses also limit our ability to claim U.S. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-U.S. operations. In addition, as part of U.S. tax reform, the U.S. enacted a tax on base eroding payments from the U.S. We have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. The U.S. also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). Because we have tangible assets outside the U.S. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this U.S. tax on foreign earnings. Overall, these enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-U.S. operations.

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in expense from global operations compared to 2021 reflects larger non-U.S. losses without a tax benefit and the impact of revaluing deferred taxes as a result of tax law changes. 
 
 A more detailed analysis of differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 15. 
 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. We conduct research and development (R D) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. In addition to funding R D internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall R D for the company.

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS primarily comprise our GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) business, discontinued in 2021, our mortgage portfolio in Poland, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. Results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. See Note 2 for further information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 FINANCIAL POLICY . We intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and share buyback decisions. 
 
 2022 FORM 10-K 16 

LIQUIDITY POLICY. We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. We believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. 
 
 CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY. Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. Cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, timing of Aerospace-related customer allowances, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was 17.3 billion at December 31, 2022, of which 11.7 billion was held in the U.S. and 5.5 billion was held outside the U.S. 
 
 Cash held in non-U.S. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to U.S. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. Any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. With regards to our announcement to form three public companies, the planning for and execution of the separations has impacted and is expected to continue to impact indefinite reinvestment. The impact of such changes will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2022 included 2.4 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions (including a total of 0.1 billion in Russia and Ukraine) and 0.7 billion of restricted use cash. Cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the U.S. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the U.S. without incurring substantial costs. Restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. Excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was 0.6 billion of cash in our run-off Insurance business, which was classified as All other assets in the Statement of Financial Position. 
 
 In connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our Baker Hughes position over approximately three years, we received proceeds of 4.7 billion in 2022. In addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time. 
 
 Following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department (KID), we provided a total of 11.4 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including 2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately 3.6 billion through 2024 (of which approximately 1.8 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2023, pending completion of our December 31, 2022 statutory reporting process). See Note 12 for further information. 
 
 On March 6, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3 billion of our common stock. In connection with this authorization, we repurchased 13 million shares for a total of 1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 BORROWINGS. Consolidated total borrowings were 32.4 billion and 35.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of 2.8 billion. The reduction in borrowings was driven by 10.1 billion of net maturities and repayments of debt including a 6.4 billion debt tender completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and 1.0 billion primarily related to changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by 8.3 billion issued by GE HealthCare in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 We have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling 14.4 billion at December 31, 2022, comprising a 10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of 4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities. 
 
 GE HealthCare Actions . In the fourth quarter of 2022, as part of the financing for the planned spin-off, GE HealthCare issued a total of 8.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt. These notes are obligations of GE HealthCare and were guaranteed by GE until the completion of the spin-off on January 3, 2023. These notes remained with GE HealthCare at the spin-off on January 3, 2023. See Note 10 for further information. 
 
 Also in the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the planned spin-off, GE HealthCare entered into three new credit facilities totaling 5.5 billion. These credit facilities consist of a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of 2.5 billion; a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility in an aggregate committed amount of 1.0 billion; and a three-year senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 2.0 billion. These credit facilities remained with GE HealthCare at the spin-off on January 3, 2023. 
 
 GE Liability Management Actions. In the fourth quarter of 2022, GE used the majority of the proceeds from the senior unsecured debt issued by GE HealthCare to complete a debt tender to repurchase a total of 6.4 billion of debt issued by GE or certain affiliates (and assumed or guaranteed by GE). In doing so, we incurred debt extinguishment costs of 0.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of 7.0 billion. See Note 10 for further information.

CREDIT RATINGS AND CONDITIONS. We have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. The cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Moody s Investors Service (Moody s), Standard and Poor s Global Ratings (S P), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below. 
 
 Moody's S P Fitch Outlook Negative Stable Stable Short term P-2 A-2 F2 Long term Baa1 BBB+ BBB 
 
 We are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In connection with the planned spin-off of GE HealthCare, rating agencies reviewed ratings for GE. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Moody s and Fitch reaffirmed their ratings for GE, and S P announced that it changed its outlook for GE from Credit Watch Negative to Stable. For a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the Financial Risks section of Risk Factors. 
 
 Substantially all of the Company's debt agreements in place at December 31, 2022 do not contain material credit rating covenants. Our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-EBITDA financial covenant, which we satisfied at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. The following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level. 
 
 Triggers Below December 31, 2022 
 BBB+/A-2/P-2 69 BBB/A-3/P-3 266 BBB- 1,427 BB+ and below 610 
 Our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. The timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels. 
 
 FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee and the British pound sterling, among others. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings was less than 0.1 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. See Note 22 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements. 
 
 Exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. We apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. It is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. To assess exposure to interest rate risk, we apply a +/- 100 basis points change in interest rates and keep that in place for the next 12 months. To assess exposure to currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10 shift in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (USD). The analyses indicated that our 2022 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than 0.1 billion for interest rate risk and for foreign exchange risk. 
 
 LIBOR REFORM. In connection with the transition away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate benchmark, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) plans to cease the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The Company s most significant exposures to LIBOR relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the Company, which use USD LIBOR. Such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by New York law. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. We are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting .

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
 CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. The most significant source of cash in CFOA is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. GE measures itself on a free cash flows basis. This metric includes CFOA plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. We believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the GE Pension Plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off Insurance business, separation cash expenditures, Corporate restructuring cash expenditures (associated with the separation-related program announced in October 2022) and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. We believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows .

 Cash from operating activities was 5.9 billion in 2022, an increase of 5.0 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: a decrease in financial services-related cash collateral paid net of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts of 1.0 billion, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures; an increase in net income (after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, non-cash losses related to our interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily in our Aerospace business; an increase in cash from working capital of 2.3 billion; and an increase in cash from All other operating activities of 2.5 billion. The components of All other operating activities were as follows:

The cash impacts from changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of (2.8) billion, driven by higher volume partially offset by the impact of decreases in sales of receivables to third parties in 2021; inventories, including deferred inventory, of (1.6) billion, driven by higher material purchases partially offset by higher liquidations; current contract assets of 0.4 billion, driven by higher billings on our long-term service agreements, partially offset by net favorable changes in estimated profitability; accounts payable and equipment project payables of 2.8 billion, driven by higher volume and lower disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; and progress collections and current deferred income of 3.5 billion, driven by lower liquidations and higher collections, including 0.6 billion of increased customer collections on equipment orders to support production at our Aerospace business. 
 
 Cash from investing activities was 1.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of 21.9 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: non-recurrence of sale proceeds of 22.4 billion from the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap in 2021; cash paid related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of 0.3 billion in 2022, primarily related to a capital contribution to Bank BPH, as compared to cash received of 1.6 billion in 2021, primarily from our GECAS business (both components of All other investing activities); partially offset by non-recurrence of the acquisition of BK Medical by our HealthCare business of 1.5 billion in 2021; an increase in proceeds of 0.6 billion from the sales of our retained ownership interest in Baker Hughes and a decrease in net purchases of insurance investment securities of 0.4 billion. Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows , was 1.5 billion in 2022 and 1.4 billion in 2021. 
 
 Cash used for financing activities was 5.6 billion in 2022, a decrease of 39.7 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: lower cash paid to repurchase long-term debt of 32.3 billion; GE HealthCare's long-term debt issuance in connection with the spin-off of 8.3 billion and lower other net debt maturities of 0.9 billion; partially offset by an increase in purchases of GE common stock for treasury of 0.9 billion, the settlement of Concept Laser GmbH's interest in an Aerospace technology joint venture of 0.2 billion and higher cash paid on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of 0.2 billion (both components of All other financing activities). We paid cash to repurchase long-term debt of 6.9 billion and 39.2 billion, including cash received of 0.3 billion and cash paid of 7.2 billion related to debt extinguishment costs, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of (0.8) billion and 0.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 CASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. Cash from investing activities in 2022 was primarily due to a capital contribution to Bank BPH from continuing operations. Cash from operating activities and cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily due to cash generated from earnings in our GECAS business and net settlements from GECAS to continuing operations, respectively. 
 
 SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAMS . We facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their GE receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included in accounts payable was 4.1 billion and 3.4 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. Total supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were 7.6 billion and 6.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 11 for further information. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. See Note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies. 
 
 REVENUE RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM SERVICES AGREEMENTS. We have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our Power and Aerospace segments that require us to maintain the customers assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. However, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services. 
 
 Customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. We generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates. 
 
 To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 2022 FORM 10-K 20 

We routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract. 
 
 We regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions may affect a long-term services agreement s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings. 
 
 On December 31, 2022, our net long-term service agreements balance of (0.7) billion represents approximately (0.3) of our total estimated life of contract billings of 202.2 billion. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.7 complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by 0.4 billion. Billings collected on these contracts were 11.7 billion and 10.0 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Notes 1 and 8 for further information. 
 
 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS . We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. In assessing the possibility that a reporting unit s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts , decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof) or changes to interest rates, if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any. 
 
 We determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. 
 
 Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have characteristics similar to our businesses. 
 
 Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 11 to 21 . 
 
 Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. 
 
 We review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. To determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. See Notes 1 and 7 for further information.

INCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of U.S. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in connection with the execution of the Company's plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we incurred 0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings. 
 
 We evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. Amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were 1.3 billion and 1.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of this, 0.1 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information. 
 
 LOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information. 

OTHER ITEMS 
 INSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. Our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred. We regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. 
 
 Key Portfolio Characteristics 
 Long-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. 

2022 FORM 10-K 22 

Presented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio. 
 
 December 31, 2022 ERAC UFLIC Total Gross GAAP future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves 16,844 5,109 21,953 Gross statutory future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves(a) 24,670 6,354 31,024 Number of policies in force 181,700 52,600 234,300 Number of covered lives in force 241,500 52,600 294,100 Average policyholder attained age 77 84 79 Gross GAAP future policy benefit reserve per policy (in actual dollars) 78,600 58,800 74,100 Gross GAAP future policy benefit reserve per covered life (in actual dollars) 59,100 58,800 59,100 Gross statutory future policy benefit reserve per policy (in actual dollars)(a) 120,300 79,800 111,200 Gross statutory future policy benefit reserve per covered life (in actual dollars)(a) 90,500 79,800 88,600 Percentage of policies with: Lifetime benefit period 69 32 61 Inflation protection option 80 91 83 Joint lives 33 26 Percentage of policies that are premium paying 69 75 70 Policies on claim 9,700 8,200 17,900 
 (a) Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately 1.8 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further in Note 12 . 
 
 Structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 26,000 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 55. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than- average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits. 
 
 Our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2022, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately 59 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.4 million policies with an average attained age of 61. In 2022, our incurred claims were approximately 0.5 billion with an average individual claim of approximately 46,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 17 of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below. 
 
 Future policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, those discussed in Premium Deficiency Testing below. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops. 
 
 Claim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined. 
 
 Premium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes. 
 
 2022 FORM 10-K 23 

The primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include: 
 
 Morbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). 
 
 Rate of Change in Morbidity . Our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. These estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. This exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. 
 
 Mortality . Mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. 
 
 Discount rate . Interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected future investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. In estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. 
 
 Future long-term care premium rate increases . Long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. As a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. While we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. The amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. We consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. 
 
 Terminations . Terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. Termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. 
 
 2022 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2022. These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10 of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. 
 
 GAAP Reserve Sensitivities. The following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key assumptions underlying our 2022 premium deficiency testing, exclusive of the impacts of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models as the conversion remains incomplete at the time of our 2022 premium deficiency testing. Many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. Small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

While higher assumed inflation, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in unfavorable impacts to the projected present value of future cash flows, it would be expected to be mitigated by a higher discount rate and more policies reaching contractual daily or monthly benefit caps. 
 
 Our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Statutory accounting practices are set forth by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from GAAP and would result in several of the sensitivities described in the table above being less impactful on our statutory reserves. 
 
 See Capital Resources and Liquidity, Other Items - New Accounting Standards and Notes 3 and 12 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2023 and applied retrospectively to January 1, 2021 (i.e., the transition date). We will adopt the new guidance using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. We expect adoption of the new guidance will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables and materially affect our consolidated financial statements and require changes to our actuarial, accounting and financial reporting processes, systems, and internal controls. The new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions warrant revision with any required changes recorded in earnings. These changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. Under the new guidance, the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single A) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of our insurance liabilities and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsurance contracts, changes in reinsurance recoverables from updating the single A discount rate in each reporting period are also recognized in AOCI. The allowance for credit losses on reinsurance recoverables will continue to be based on the locked-in discount rate for purposes of assessing changes in each reporting period. As such, movements in the gross reinsurance recoverable balance resulting from changes in the single A discount rate will not impact the allowance for credit losses. Following the recapture transaction effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, as explained in Note 12, the remaining reinsurance recoverables are not material. 
 
 In conjunction with the adoption of the new guidance, we are in process of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models that are based on more granular assumptions of expected future experience and will facilitate the new guidance's requirements. 

2022 FORM 10-K 25 

We currently estimate a decrease in Shareholders equity at the transition date from adoption of the new guidance to be in an after-tax range of 7.0 billion to 8.0 billion, including approximately 5.5 billion to 6.0 billion in AOCI and 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion in Retained earnings. The decrease in AOCI is primarily attributable to remeasuring our insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables using the single A discount rate required under the new guidance, which is lower than our current locked-in discount rate, and the removal of shadow adjustments. The decrease in Retained earnings at the transition date is primarily attributable to certain long-term care insurance exposures where the projected present value of future cash flows exceeds the reserves at the transition date, based on the required lower level of grouping of contracts, combined with converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models. As of December 31, 2022, we estimate the decrease in Shareholders' equity to be reduced to approximately 3.0 billion to 4.0 billion, primarily due to changes in the market interest rate environment subsequent to the transition date. 
 
 The new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under GAAP. In addition, we do not expect changes to statutory insurance reserves, regulatory capital requirements or projected funding as a result of the implementation of the first principles models. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; and equipment and services organic revenues and (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; Adjusted profit and profit margin; Adjusted organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted income tax rate; and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow.

RISK FACTORS. The following discussion of the material factors, events and uncertainties that may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky contains "forward-looking statements," as discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements section. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K report or elsewhere. The risks described below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we face, and additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact us. The following information should be read in conjunction with the MD A section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks we describe in this Form 10-K report or in our other SEC filings could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. 
 
 STRATEGIC RISKS. Strategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: our strategic plan to separate into three public companies; the global macro-environment; the global energy transition; competitive threats, the demand for our products and services and the success of our investments in technology and innovation; our portfolio of businesses and capital allocation decisions; dispositions, acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring activity; intellectual property; and other risks. 
 
 2022 FORM 10-K 30 

Strategic plan - We may encounter challenges to executing our plan to separate GE into three public companies, or to completing the plan within the timeframes we anticipate, and we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separations. In November 2021, we announced our plan to form three independent public companies from our (i) Aerospace business, (ii) HealthCare business and (iii) portfolio of energy businesses that we plan to combine as GE Vernova (Renewable Energy, Power, Digital and Energy Financial Services), to better position those businesses to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors, and employees. In January 2023, our HealthCare business was spun off as GE HealthCare. The GE HealthCare business separation was, and the planned GE Vernova business separation is expected to be, effected through spin-offs by GE that are intended to be tax-free for the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and with all three resulting companies having investment grade credit ratings. The GE Vernova separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approvals by GE s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or tax opinions from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, and establishment of the capital structures and credit ratings for both GE Vernova and the remainder of GE following the spin-off. A failure to satisfy required conditions, or disruptions in market conditions, could delay the completion of the GE Vernova separation transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Additionally, the GE Vernova separation transaction is complex in nature, and business, market or other developments or changes may affect our ability to complete the separation transaction as currently expected, within the anticipated timeframe or at all. These or other developments could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete the GE Vernova separation, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of GE Vernova or GE Aerospace as independent companies. In addition, although we intend for the GE Vernova separation transaction to be tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that either of the separation transactions will qualify as tax-free for U.S. purposes for the Company or its shareholders. If either of the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company s shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that each separate company will be successful as a standalone public company. 
 
 Whether or not the GE Vernova separation transaction is completed, our businesses may face material challenges as a result of the GE HealthCare separation and in connection with the GE Vernova separation, including the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among GE Aerospace and GE Vernova; maintaining employee morale and retaining and attracting key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts, guaranties and other contracts and instruments to each of the businesses, and obtaining releases from the counterparties to those contracts or beneficiaries of those instruments; providing financial or credit support for new business; assigning intellectual property to each of the businesses; establishing transition service agreements and standalone readiness for key functions; and potential negative reactions from investors or the financial community. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives, and the GE HealthCare separation) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. These pose risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation of GE Vernova. 
 
 Moreover, completion of the GE HealthCare separation has resulted, and completion of the GE Vernova separation will result in independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE was prior to the separation transactions. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to global economic trends, geopolitical risks, demand or supply shocks, and changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to execute of capital allocation plans, fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent public companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. Investors holding our common stock may also sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock. Any decline in the market price of GE HealthCare common stock will also affect the value of our retained equity ownership in that company and could affect the timing and tax treatment of our disposition of that stake. 
 
 Global macro-environment - Our growth is subject to global economic, political and geopolitical risks. We operate in virtually every part of the world, serve customers in over 170 countries and received 57 of our revenues for 2022 from outside the United States. Our operations and the execution of our business plans and strategies are subject to the effects of global economic trends, geopolitical risks and demand or supply shocks from events such as war or international conflict, a major terrorist attack, natural disasters or actual or threatened public health emergencies (such as COVID-19, including virus variants and resurgences and responses to those). They are also affected by local and regional economic environments, supply chain constraints and policies in the U.S. and other markets that we serve, including factors such as continuing inflationary pressures in many markets, continuing increases in interest rates from recent historic lows, economic growth rates, the availability of skilled labor, monetary policy, exchange rates and 
 2022 FORM 10-K 31 

currency volatility, commodity prices and sovereign debt levels. For example, ongoing inflationary pressures have caused and may continue to cause many of our material and labor costs to increase, which can adversely affect our profitability and cash flows, particularly when we are unable to increase customer contract values or pricing to offset those pressures. At the same time, Russia s invasion of Ukraine and related political and economic consequences, such as sanctions and other measures imposed by the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and organizations in response, have also caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in global markets, supply chains and industries that negatively impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations and pose reputational risks. Further deterioration of economic conditions or outlooks, such as lower rates of investment, lower economic growth, recession or fears of recession in the U.S., China, Europe or other key markets, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services, and the impact from developments outside the U.S. on our business performance can be significant given the extent of our global activities. In addition, political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as tariffs, export controls, restrictions on outbound investment or other trade barriers, sanctions, technical or local content regulations, currency controls, or changes to tax or other laws and policies, have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses. These can interfere with our global operating model, supply chain, production costs, customer relationships and competitive position. Further escalation of any specific trade tensions, including intensified decoupling between the U.S. and China, or in global trade conflict more broadly could be harmful to global economic growth or to our business in or with China or other countries. We also do business in many emerging market jurisdictions where economic, political and legal risks are heightened and the operating environments are complex. 
 
 COVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve, particularly for our Aerospace business. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While there has been recovery in many business sectors compared to the initial years of the pandemic, virus resurgences and variants, regional or site lockdowns and similar dynamics may continue to cause operational challenges at our facilities or with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our business and financial performance. In particular, our Aerospace business constitutes a substantial portion of our financial results, and accordingly the adverse impacts that COVID-19 has had and may continue to have on commercial air traffic and operators, airlines, airframers, lessors, suppliers and other actors in the aviation sector more broadly are significant for GE. Interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 have had a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products, and in some cases may threaten the future viability of some customers. Industry participants measures in response to these dynamics could lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes. There are also risks related to longer-term strategies the aviation industry may implement, such as reducing capacity, shifting route patterns or other strategies to mitigate impacts from COVID-19 and the risk of future public health crises, and from potential shifts in the flying public s demand for travel, any of which could adversely affect the pace of recovery in commercial air traffic capacity and the demand for or profitability of our products and services. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreaks around the world; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including regional lockdowns, restrictions on travel and transport or changes such as China s recent reversal of its zero-COVID policy); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability, public acceptance and continued efficacy of treatments or vaccines; and the pace and extent of recovery from the past and any future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacts and risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described in this section. 
 
 Energy transition - The strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities. Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change and energy security. These changes present both risks and opportunities for our businesses, many of which provide products and services to customers in sectors like power generation and commercial aviation that have historically been carbon intensive and we expect will remain important to efforts globally to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the levelized cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor, customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products and services related to fossil fuel-based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants that are unmitigated with capabilities such as hydrogen or carbon capture. Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation, particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different markets globally, could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our Power business and our consolidated results. While the currently anticipated market growth and power generation share for renewable energy is expected to be favorable for our wind businesses over time, we face uncertainties related to future levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies), significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturers, changing dynamics between onshore and offshore wind power, potential further consolidation in the wind industry, competition with solar power-based and other sources of renewable energy and the pace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration. The achievement of deep decarbonization goals for the power sector over the coming decades is likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear power and grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions). Successfully navigating these changes 
 2022 FORM 10-K 32 

will require significant investments in power grids and other infrastructure, research and development and new technology and products, both by GE and third parties. Similar dynamics exist in the aviation sector, where decarbonization over time will require a combination of continued technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanded use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. For example, the risk of insufficient availability of low carbon fuels (such as sustainable aviation fuels or hydrogen) may compromise the pace and degree of decarbonization within the aviation sector. Our success in advancing decarbonization objectives across our businesses will depend in part on the actions of governments, regulators and other market participants to invest in infrastructure, create appropriate market incentives and to otherwise support the development of new technologies. The process of developing new high-technology products and enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not prove to be commercially successful in the time frames expected or at all. 
 
 A failure by GE or other industry participants to invest successfully in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to benefit from the growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, ability to attract and retain talent, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we face increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financiers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, which can result in additional costs and pose reputational or other risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries or relative to progress that we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products and achieving our publicly announced ambitions. We anticipate that we will continue to need to make investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those investments and actions. Trends related to the global energy transition and decarbonization, will affect the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings within and across our energy businesses and our Aerospace business. Important factors that could impact our businesses include the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption and pace of implementation of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors. 
 
 Competitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships, market acceptance of new product and service introductions, and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and retain skilled talent. Our long-term operating results and competitive position also depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative technology, products, services and platforms, to develop digital solutions for our own operations and our customers, to modify existing products and services, to customize products and services, to maintain long-term customer relationships and to increase our productivity over time as we perform on long-term service agreements. We often enter into long-term service agreements in both our Aerospace and Power businesses in connection with significant contracts for the sale of equipment. In connection with these agreements, we must accurately estimate our costs associated with delivering the products, product durability and reliability, and the provision of services over time in order to be profitable and generate acceptable returns on our investments. A failure to appropriately estimate or plan for or execute our business plans may adversely affect our delivery of products, services and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and an erosion of our competitive position. In addition, at our Renewable Energy business, the rapid pace of innovation among onshore and offshore wind turbine manufacturers in recent years has led to short product cycles, early market introductions and faster time to market, all of which can lead to quality and execution issues, higher costs and other challenges to achieving profitability for new products. 
 
 Our businesses are also subject to technological change and advances, such as growth in industrial automation and increased digitization of the operations, infrastructure and solutions that customers demand across all the industries we serve. The introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies in the markets in which we operate also poses risks in the form of new competitors (including new entrants from outside our traditional industries, such as competitors from digital technology companies), market consolidation, substitutions of existing products, services or solutions, niche players, new business models and competitors that are faster to market with new or more cost-effective products or services. Existing and new competitors frequently offer services for our installed base, and if the customers that purchase our equipment and products select our competitors services of if we otherwise fail to maintain or renew service relationships, this can erode the revenues and profitability of our businesses. In addition, the research and development cycle involved in bringing products in our businesses to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the economic conditions or competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments, to the extent they result in bringing a product to market, may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development efforts to pursue advancement in a wide range of technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities. Under-investment in research and development, or investment in technologies that prove to be less competitive in the future (at the expense of alternative investment opportunities not pursued), could lead to loss of sales of our products and services in the future, particularly in our long-cycle businesses that have longer product development cycles. The amounts that we do invest in research and development efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. 
 
 Business portfolio - Our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objectives, including through acquisitions, integrations, dispositions and joint ventures. With respect to acquisitions and business integrations or with dispositions, separations, such as the spin-off of GE HealthCare, and joint ventures, we may not achieve expected returns or other benefits on a timely basis or at all as a result of changes in strategy, integration challenges or other factors. Over the past several years we have also 
 2022 FORM 10-K 33 

been pursuing a variety of dispositions, and we plan to exit our equity interests in AerCap and GE HealthCare over time. Declines in the values of equity interests (such as our interests AerCap and GE HealthCare) or other assets (such as the AerCap senior notes that we hold) that we sell can diminish the cash proceeds that we realize, and our ability and timing to sell can depend on the liquidity of the relevant asset and other market conditions. We may dispose of businesses or assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, or with purchase price adjustments or the exclusion of assets or liabilities that must be divested, managed or run off separately. Dispositions or other business separations also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, retained assets or liabilities, transition services agreements, commercial agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations or liabilities. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could materially affect our future financial results. Evaluating or executing on all types of potential or planned portfolio transactions can divert senior management time and resources from other pursuits. We also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world, including joint ventures where we have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which expose us to additional operational, financial, reputational, legal or compliance risks. 
 
 Intellectual property - Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours, and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependencies. Our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology, particularly in certain markets outside the US where intellectual property laws and related enforcement mechanisms may not be as well-developed. Trademark licenses of the GE brand in connection with dispositions may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future. We also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. We also face attempts, both internally from insider threats and externally from cyber-attacks, to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. In addition, we have observed an increase in the use of social engineering tactics by bad actors attempting to obtain confidential business information or credentials to access systems with our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such incidents could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development. In addition, we are subject to the enforcement of patents or other intellectual property by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. GE has in the past, and may in the future be, found to infringe third-party rights, which could require us to pay substantial damages or enjoin us from offering some of our products and services. The value of, or our ability to use, our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependencies on third parties, such as our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable terms licenses that we need in the future, or our ability to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS. Operational risk relates to risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes risks related to product and service lifecycle and execution; product safety and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; and supply chain and business disruption. 
 
 Operational execution - Operational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company s financial results depend on the successful execution of our businesses operating plans across all steps of the product and service lifecycle. We continue working to improve the operations and execution of our businesses and our ability to make the desired improvements will be a significant factor in our overall financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with launching or ramping new product platforms, such as the Haliade-X offshore wind turbine or new onshore wind turbine models at Renewable Energy, or the LEAP engine at Aerospace. Particularly with newer product platforms and technologies, our businesses seek to reduce the costs of these products over time with experience, and risks related to our supply chain, the availability of skilled labor, product quality, timely delivery, liquidated damages or other aspects of operational execution can adversely affect our ability to meet customers' expectations, profits and cash flows. Operational failures at any of our businesses that result in quality problems or potential product, environmental, health or safety risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, a portion of our business in recent years at our Power and Renewable Energy businesses involves large projects where we have taken on, or are members of a consortium responsible for, the full scope of engineering, procurement, construction or other services. We have been increasing our selectivity as to how frequently and with what scope of work we will participate in these types of projects, which often pose unique risks related to their location, scale, complexity, duration and pricing or payment structure. Delivering on these types of projects with multiple parties and subcontractors involved, particularly outside of mature markets in the U.S. and Europe, is highly complex with risks related to the safety and security of workers, impacts on local communities, corruption, breach or theft of intellectual property and other factors. Performance issues or schedule delays can arise due to inadequate technical expertise, unanticipated project modifications, developments at project sites, environmental, health and safety issues, execution by or coordination with suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, financial difficulties of our customers or significant partners or compliance with government regulations, and these can lead to cost overruns, contractual penalties, liquidated damages and other adverse consequences. Where GE is a member of a consortium, we are typically subject to claims based on joint and several liability, and claims can extend to aspects of the project or costs that are not directly related or limited to GE s scope of work or over which GE does not have control. Operational, quality or other issues at large projects, or across our projects portfolio more broadly, can adversely affect GE s business, reputation, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
 2022 FORM 10-K 34 

Product safety and quality - Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, and a major failure or quality issue affecting our products or third-party products with which our products are integrated can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows . We produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our own and third-party products that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the adverse impact of product quality issues can be significant. Actual or perceived design, production, performance or other quality issues related to new product introductions or existing product lines can result in reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. For example, as discussed above, based on experience across our Onshore Wind fleet, we are deploying repairs and other corrective measures to improve overall quality and fleet availability resulting in higher warranty and related reserves. In addition, a catastrophic product failure or similar event resulting in injuries or death, widespread outages, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Even when there has not been a particularly significant or widespread product failures in the field, many of our products and services must function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting certification, performance and reliability standards that we, our customers or regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products that meet or exceed these can be costly and technologically challenging, and may also involve extensive coordination of suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of workers; a failure to deliver products and services that meet these standards could have significant adverse financial, competitive or reputational effects. In some circumstances we have also incurred and in the future we may continue to incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party s product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks. 
 
 Cybersecurity - Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks such as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of GE's and its customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of GE's and its customers' data, as well as associated financial risks. As the perpetrators of such attacks become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. Bad actors have attempted and may continue to attempt to use our strategic plan to separate into three separate companies as an opportunity to launch attacks or increase their number of attacks against GE s network. A significant cyber-related attack in one of our industries, such as an attack on power grids, power plants or commercial aircraft (even if such an attack does not involve GE products, services or systems), could pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business. We have also observed an increase in third-party breaches and ransomware attacks at suppliers, service providers and software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on GE if this trend continues may not be successful in the future. The large number of suppliers that we work with requires significant effort for the initial and ongoing verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. The increasing degree of interconnectedness between GE and its partners, suppliers and customers also poses a risk to the security of GE s network as well as the larger ecosystem in which GE operates. There can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring business partners with connections to the GE network to appropriately secure their information technology systems, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, will be sufficient to prevent, detect and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threats. 
 
 In addition to existing risks from the integration of digital technologies into our business portfolio, the adoption of new technologies in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breaches and failures. While we have developed secure development lifecycle design practices to secure our software designs and connected products, an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of GE s software or connected products and lead to the misuse or unintended use of our products, loss of GE intellectual property, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data, safety risks or unavailability of equipment. We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we have vulnerability to security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of or denial of access to information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, while we require our suppliers to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate controls to protect information we provide to them, they may be the victim of a cyber-related attack that could lead to the compromise of the Company s intellectual property, personal data or other confidential information, or to production downtimes and operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. An unknown security vulnerability or malicious software embedded in a supplier s product that is later integrated into a GE product could lead to a vulnerability in the security of GE s product or if used internally in the GE network environment to a compromise of the GE network, which could potentially lead to the loss of information or operational disruptions. Data privacy and protection laws are evolving, can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a significant cyber-related attack could result in 
 2022 FORM 10-K 35 

other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation, increased digital infrastructure or other costs that are not covered by insurance, litigation or regulatory action. 
 
 Supply chain - Significant raw material or other component shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier or customer production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases can increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems and services. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions around the world, we are also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in particular countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. We are operating in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and may continue to face, supply-chain shortages, inflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenues, profitability and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. We anticipate supply chain pressures across our businesses will continue to challenge and adversely affect our operations and financial performance for some period of time. For example, successfully executing the significant production ramp-up efforts at our Aerospace business in connection with both newer engine platforms such as the LEAP and the aviation sector s ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, depends in part on our suppliers having access to the materials and skilled labor they require and making timely deliveries to us, as well as meeting the required quality and performance standards for commercial aviation. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality and stability of such suppliers. We also have internal dependencies on certain key GE manufacturing or other facilities. Disruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disasters (including the effects of climate change such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and more intense weather events), actual or threatened public health emergencies or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. Quality, capability, compliance and sourcing issues experienced by third-party providers can also adversely affect our costs, margin rates and the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm; the harm to us could be significant if, for example, a quality issue at a supplier or with components that we integrate into our products results in a widespread quality issue across one of our product lines or our installed base of equipment. In addition, our suppliers may experience cyber-related attacks, as described above, which could negatively impact their ability to meet their delivery obligations to us and in turn have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISKS. Financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including funding and liquidity risks, such as risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding; credit risk; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact our financial condition or overall safety and soundness. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations, and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial businesses and from our remaining financial services operations. 
 
 Customers and counterparties - Global economic, industry-specific or other developments that weaken the financial condition or soundness of significant customers, governments or other parties we deal with can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and sustained economic growth and political stability in both developed and emerging markets are principal factors underlying long-term air traffic growth; the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential for recession pose risks to the rate of that growth. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by the actions of a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies. We have significant business with, and credit exposure to, some of our largest aviation customers and accordingly our Aerospace business performance can be adversely affected by challenges that individual customers or the industry faces related to factors such as competition, the need for cost reduction, financial stability and soundness, and the availability of aircraft leasing and financing alternatives, the satisfaction of certification or other regulatory requirements for aircraft in various jurisdictions, the retirement of older aircraft and other dynamics affecting the original equipment and aftermarket service markets. As described above, the extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers and suppliers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer s business. In our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, our customers also face a variety of challenges, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation, competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies); these dynamics can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 2022 FORM 10-K 36 

Borrowings - We may face risks related to our debt levels, particularly if we face severely adverse market conditions. We have significantly reduced our debt levels over the past several years through debt tenders and other liability management actions, and we expect to allocate additional capital to debt reduction in the future, with cash flows from operations and the proceeds from asset sales and dispositions (including our stakes in AerCap and GE HealthCare) as sources for that. If we are unable to generate cash flows in accordance with our plans, our deleveraging plan could be delayed or altered, which may require that we delay investments or capital expenditures. We may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as increasing borrowing under credit lines, reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures or taking other actions. In addition, we have significant pension and run-off insurance liabilities that are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that we use in our pension liability, GAAP insurance reserve and statutory insurance calculations. Our debt levels could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower debt levels that may provide them with greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operations, pursue strategic acquisitions, finance long-term projects or take other actions. Significant debt levels could also pose risks in the event of recession or adverse industry-specific conditions. In addition, elevated debt may limit our ability to obtain new debt financing on favorable terms or at all in the future, particularly if coupled with downgrades of our credit ratings or a deterioration of capital markets conditions more generally. 
 
 Liquidity - Failure to meet our cash flow targets, or additional credit downgrades, could adversely affect our liquidity, funding costs and related margins. We rely primarily on cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses and cash generated from asset sales and dispositions (including from our equity stakes in AerCap and GE HealthCare) to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations, and to meet our capital allocation objectives. We maintain short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities, as a contingency buffer of liquidity and to meet our financial obligations and capital allocation priorities. Failure to meet our cash flow objectives could adversely affect our financial condition or our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will not face credit downgrades as a result of factors such as the performance of our businesses, the failure to make progress as planned on the separation transactions and continued progress in decreasing GE s leverage, reduced diversification of GE s businesses following the separation transactions, or changes in rating application or methodology. Future downgrades could further adversely affect our ability to execute the planned spin-off of GE Vernova, as well as our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our businesses. In addition, swap, forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit ratings of the applicable GE entity were to fall below specified ratings levels agreed upon with the counterparty. For additional discussion about our current credit ratings and related considerations, refer to the Capital Resources and Liquidity - Credit Ratings and Conditions section within MD A. 
 
 Financial services operations - We continue to have exposure to insurance, credit, legal and other risks in our financial services operations and, in the event of future adverse developments, may not be able to meet our business and financial objectives without further actions or additional capital contributions . To fund the remaining statutory capital contributions that we expect to make to our insurance subsidiaries, as well as to meet our debt maturities and other obligations, we expect to rely on liquidity from our operations. There is a risk that future adverse developments could cause funding or liquidity stress. For example, it is possible that future requirements for capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries will be greater than currently estimated, or that contemplated contributions could be accelerated by regulators. Our annual testing of insurance reserves is subject to a variety of assumptions, including assumptions about the discount rate (which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates), morbidity, mortality and future long-term care premium increases. Any future adverse changes to these assumptions (to the extent not offset by any favorable changes to these assumptions) could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserves and, potentially, to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to our insurance subsidiaries (as discussed in the Other Items - Insurance section within MD A). We also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard that became effective on January 1, 2023 (as discussed in the Other Items - New Accounting Standards section within MD A) will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. In addition, we continue to evaluate potential strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of our financial services operations. Some of these options could involve cash payments, financial charges or other adverse effects depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements. In addition, our financial services operations also have exposure to various industries and counterparties, including insurance companies, brokers and dealers, and financial institutions, which exposes us to credit and other risks in the event of insolvency or other default of a counterparty. For example, a portion of our run-off insurance operations assets are held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts. For our UFLIC subsidiary, such trust assets are currently held in trusts for the benefit of insurance company subsidiaries of Genworth, which stated in 2021 that any proceeds from its contingency plan will be used to repay parent company debt and not to bolster the capital position of its insurance subsidiaries. Solvency or other concerns about Genworth or its insurance company subsidiaries may cause those subsidiaries or their regulators to take or attempt to take actions that could adversely affect UFLIC, including control over assets in the relevant trusts. It is also possible that contingent liabilities and loss estimates from our financial services-related continuing or discontinued operations, such as those related to Bank BPH (see Note 24), will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable. There can be no assurance that future liabilities, losses or impairments to the carrying value of assets within our financial services operations would not materially and adversely affect GE s business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations or capacity to provide financing to support orders at the businesses. 
 
 Postretirement benefit plans - Increases in pension, healthcare and life insurance benefits obligations and costs can adversely affect our earnings , cash flows and further progress toward our leverage goals . Our results of operations and financial conditions may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates and other economic conditions such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and 
 2022 FORM 10-K 37 

future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense, such as a prolonged environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under ERISA. Such factors could also result in a failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current and future retirees. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs, or that the assignment of assets and liabilities with respect to certain U.S. and non-U.S. benefit plans in connection with GE s ongoing separation into three separate companies, will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligations, the legal split of certain benefit plans and the transfer of certain postretirement plans to GE HealthCare in connection with the Separation, see Notes 13 and 28. 
 
 LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment, legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including matters relating to financial reporting and the environment, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices. 
 
 Regulatory - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways. Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. In particular, recent trends globally toward increased protectionism, import and export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business dealings with certain countries or entities, the use of tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment and other trade barriers can result in actions by governments around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our businesses, and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position. In addition, changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including carbon pricing, emission standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the power or aviation sectors could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our businesses or competitive position. Other legislative and regulatory areas of significance for our businesses that U.S. and non-U.S. governments have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity, data privacy and sovereignty, anti-corruption, competition law, public procurement law, compliance with complex trade controls and economic sanctions laws, technical regulations or local content requirements that could result in market access criteria that our products cannot or do not meet, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries' structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements, effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, states or non-U.S. governments, or rules, interpretations or audits under new or existing tax laws such as newly adopted global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax rate. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that can lead to fines, damages or other penalties. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects, and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, or to participate in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 
 Legal proceedings - We are subject to legal proceedings, disputes, investigations and legal compliance risks, including trailing liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. For example, following our acquisition of Alstom's Thermal, Renewables and Grid businesses in 2015, we are subject to legacy legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or corruption by Alstom in the pre-acquisition period, and payments for settlements, judgments, penalties or other liabilities in connection with those matters have resulted and will in the future result in cash outflows. In addition, while in December 2020 we entered into a settlement to conclude the previously disclosed SEC investigation of GE, we remain subject to shareholder lawsuits related to the Company's financial performance, accounting and disclosure practices and related legacy matters. We have observed that these proceedings related to claims about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risks for the Company that can cause new allegations about past or current misconduct, even if unfounded, to have a more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investors, customers and others than they otherwise would. We have established reserves for legal matters when and as appropriate; however, the estimation of legal reserves or possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our current estimates and adversely affect our results of operations. The risk management and compliance programs we have adopted and related actions that we take may not fully mitigate legal and compliance risks that we face, particularly 
 2022 FORM 10-K 38 

in light of the global and diverse nature of our operations and the current enforcement environments in many jurisdictions. For example, when we investigate potential noncompliance under U.S. and non-U.S. law involving GE employees or third parties we work with, in some circumstances we make self-disclosures about our findings to the relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us in connection with those matters. We are also subject to material trailing legal liabilities from businesses that we dispose of or that are inactive. We also expect that additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time. Moreover, we sell products and services in growth markets where claims arising from alleged violations of law, product failures or other incidents involving our products and services are adjudicated within legal systems that are less developed and less reliable than those of the U.S. or other more developed markets, and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceedings before courts or other governmental bodies in those markets. See Note 24 for further information about legal proceedings and other loss contingencies. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are reporting the following environmental matter in compliance with SEC requirements to disclose environmental proceedings where a governmental authority is a party and that involve potential monetary sanctions of 300,000 or greater. In July 2022, GE HealthCare received a notice of intention to impose an administrative fine of approximately 0.6 million related to a December 2019 liquid hazardous waste event at its Rehovot, Israel site. The event involved clean room waste that spilled onto an unsealed floor, leading to an escape of a small amount of liquid to a third-party facility on a lower floor. The Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) concluded that the incident breached the site s toxins permit. In accordance with local law, GE HealthCare responded to MEP s notice of fine challenging both the basis for, and level of, the fine. A decision from MEP is pending. With our spin-off of GE HealthCare in January 2023, GE will no longer report on this matter. Refer to Legal Matters and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to our legal matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Sales of services - Revenue recognition on certain long-term service agreements - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company enters into long-term service agreements with certain customers, predominately within the Aerospace and Power segments. These agreements require the Company to provide maintenance services for customer assets over the contract term, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. Revenue for these agreements is recognized using the percentage of completion method, based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs over the contract term. As part of the revenue recognition process, the Company estimates both customer payments that are expected to be received and costs to perform maintenance services over the contract term. Key estimates that require significant judgment from management include: (a) how the customer will utilize the assets covered over the contract term; (b) the expected timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul services; (c) the future cost of materials, labor, and other resources; and (d) forward looking information concerning market conditions. 
 
 Given the complexity involved with evaluating the key estimates, which includes significant judgment necessary to estimate customer payments and future costs, auditing these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and industry knowledge. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our auditing procedures over the key estimates described above related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition of the long-term service agreements, predominately within the Aerospace and Power segments, included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the revenue recognition process for the long-term service agreements, including controls over management s key estimates. 
 We evaluated management s risk assessment process through observation of key meetings and processes, including inspection of documentation, addressing contract status and current market conditions including the timely incorporation of changes that affect total estimated costs to complete the contract and future billings. 
 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management s methods and key assumptions applied in recognizing revenue and developing cost estimates. 
 2022 FORM 10-K 40 

We tested management s utilization assumptions for the assets covered over the contract term, which impact the estimated timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul services by comparing current estimates to historical information and projected market conditions. 
 We tested management s process for estimating the timing and amount of costs associated with maintenance, overhaul, and other major events throughout the contract term, including comparing estimates to historical cost experience, performing a retrospective review, performing analytical procedures, and utilizing specialists to evaluate engineering studies and statistical models used by the Company to estimate the useful life of certain components of the installed equipment. 
 
 Premium deficiency testing - future policy benefits refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company performs premium deficiency testing to assess the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a premium deficiency event may have occurred. Significant uncertainties exist in testing cash flow projections in the premium deficiency test for these insurance contracts, including consideration of a wide range of possible outcomes of future events over the life of the insurance contracts that can extend for long periods of time. 
 
 Given the significant judgments made by management in estimating the cash flow projections used in the premium deficiency test, including the determination of certain key assumptions, auditing the premium deficiency test required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists. Key assumptions impacting the cash flow projections that are sensitive and are more subjective requiring significant judgment by management are discount rate, rate of changes in morbidity, and future long-term care premium rate increases. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures, which included the involvement of our actuarial specialists, related to the premium deficiency analysis included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the premium deficiency test process, including controls over the development of key assumptions and management s judgments related to the development of the cash flow projections. 
 We tested the underlying data for completeness and accuracy, including historical cash flows that served as the basis for the actuarial estimates. 
 We evaluated the key assumptions by considering historical actual experience, sensitivity analyses, relevant industry data when available, and management s basis for changes or lack of change in key assumptions. 
 We performed recalculations to assess key assumptions were appropriately applied in the cash flow projections. 
 We evaluated management s conclusion for the premium deficiency test and verified the results appropriately reflected key assumptions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Electric Company 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of General Electric Company and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

to years . We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade). 
 
 We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at predetermined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. 
 
 Our billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) or upon the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. See Note 8 for further information. 
 
 We also enter into long-term services agreements in our HealthCare and Renewable Energy segments. Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed equipment repairs. We generally invoice periodically as services are provided. 
 
 Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenues and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer.

As of December 31, 2022, we estimate the after-tax decrease in Shareholders' equity to be reduced to approximately billion to billion, primarily due to changes in the market interest rate environment subsequent to the transition date.

 GECAS/AerCap. On November 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap). We deconsolidated this business, reclassified its results to discontinued operations for all periods presented and recognized a non-cash after-tax loss of million in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 We have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest, ongoing sales or leases of products and services, and transition services that we provide to AerCap. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had direct and indirect sales of million to AerCap, primarily related to engine services and sales, and purchases of million from AerCap, primarily related to engine leases. We paid net cash of million to AerCap related to this activity. 
 
 Bank BPH . The mortgage portfolio in Poland (Bank BPH) comprises floating rate residential mortgages, of which are indexed to or denominated in foreign currencies (primarily Swiss francs). At December 31, 2022, the total portfolio had a carrying value, net of reserves, of million. The portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, which reflects market yields as well as estimates with respect to ongoing litigation in Poland related to foreign currency-denominated mortgages and other factors. Loss from discontinued operations included million, million and million non-cash pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflecting estimates with respect to ongoing litigation as well as market yields. To ensure appropriate capital levels, we made capital contributions in cash of million and million into Bank BPH during the second quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively. Future changes in the estimated legal liabilities or market yields could result in further losses and capital contributions related to these loans in future reporting periods beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.

 Reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances of an insignificant amount and million, are included in non-current All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position, and amounted to million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2022, we agreed to terminate substantially all long-term care insurance exposures previously ceded to a single reinsurance company (recapture transaction) and recorded an increase to our allowance for credit losses on such reinsurance recoverables of million (pre-tax) million (after-tax)) which is unrelated to changes in claim experience or projections of future policy benefit reserves. Upon closing of the recapture transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022, we received a net portfolio of investment securities with an estimated fair value of million in complete settlement of reinsurance recoverables previously recognized under retrocession agreements with the reinsurance company, which represented substantially all of our reinsurance recoverables balance as of September 30, 2022 and recorded an incremental loss of million (pre-tax) million (after-tax)). 
 
 The recapture transaction reduces both our financial and operational risks by removing the future inherent risk of collectability of reinsurance recoverables, eliminating retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions, assuming direct control of the portfolio of investment securities held in a trust for our benefit and redeploying those assets consistent with our portfolio realignment strategy and establishing administration service standards intended to enhance claim administration and innovation efforts. The effect of the recapture agreement does not increase our long-term care insurance liabilities as under the existing retrocession agreements we were not previously relieved of our primary obligation to companies from which we originally assumed the liabilities. In addition, we do not expect changes to projected statutory funding as a result of the recapture transaction. 
 
 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2022. These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. The premium deficiency testing margin in 2022 was impacted by a lower discount rate in our ERAC portfolio due to the recapture transaction, as explained above, partially offset by higher prevailing benchmark interest rates in the U.S. The portfolio of investment securities expected to be received from the recapture transaction were assumed to be invested at yields below ERAC s current portfolio yield before ultimately grading to the long-term average investment yield as we reinvest the portfolio over time. This effect was partially offset by the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19 in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments). Excluding the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2022. We regularly monitor emerging experience and industry developments, including these factors, to help us refine all our reserve assumptions, which may result in future changes to those assumptions.

 FUNDING. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) determines minimum funding requirements in the U.S. No contributions were required or made for the GE Pension Plan during 2022 or 2021 and based on our current assumptions, we do not anticipate having to make additional required contributions to the plan in the near future. On an ERISA basis, our estimate is that the GE Pension Plan was and funded for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The GAAP funded status is and for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 As of the measurement date of December 31, we would expect to pay approximately million fo r benefit payments under our GE Supplementary Pension Plan and administrative expenses of our principal pension plans and would expect to contribute approximately million to other pension plans in 2023. We fund retiree health benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis and the retiree life insurance trust at our discretio n.

 (a) Principally associated with discount rate changes. 
 (b) The benefit obligation for the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, which is an unfunded plan, was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (c) The benefit obligation for retiree health plans was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATIONS. Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including a discount rate, a compensation assumption, an expected return on assets, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. 
 
 Projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected benefit payments. We discount those cash payments using a discount rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense. 
 
 The compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Statement of Financial Position and amortized into earnings in subsequent periods. 

2022 FORM 10-K 65 

and long-term expected return on the GE Pension Plan assets for cost recognition in 2022 and 2021, respectively. For 2023 cost recognition, based on GE Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2022, we have assumed a long-term expected return. 
 
 The Society of Actuaries issued new mortality improvement tables during 2021 that were used to update mortality assumptions in the U.S. These changes in assumptions increased the December 31, 2021 U.S. pension and retiree benefit plans' obligations by million. 
 
 The healthcare trend assumptions primarily apply to our pre-65 retiree medical plans. Most participants in our post-65 retiree plan have a fixed subsidy and therefore are not subject to healthcare inflation. 
 
 We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographics factors such as retirement age and turnover, and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Differences between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in AOCI each period. These differences are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active participating employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable. For the principal pension plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method with a separate layer for each year s gains and losses. For most other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line or a corridor amortization method. 
 
 SENSITIVITIES TO KEY ASSUMPTIONS. Fluctuations in discount rates can significantly impact pension cost and obligations. As of the December 31 measurement date, we would expect a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by approximately million and would also expect an increase in the principal pension plan projected benefit obligation at year-end by approximately million. The deficit sensitivity to the discount rate would be lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity as a result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan's asset allocation. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by approximately million.

Plan fiduciaries of the GE Pension Plan set investment policies and strategies for the GE Pension Trust and oversee its investment allocation, which includes selecting investment managers and setting long-term strategic targets. The plan fiduciaries' primary strategic investment objectives are balancing investment risk and return and monitoring the plan s liquidity position in order to meet the plan's near-term benefit payment and other cash needs. The plan has incorporated de-risking objectives and liability hedging programs as part of its long-term investment strategy. The plan utilizes a combination of long-dated corporate bonds, treasuries, strips and derivatives to implement its investment strategies as well as for hedging asset and liability risks. Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by plan fiduciaries. Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below a target range.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX POSITIONS. Annually, we file over income tax returns in over global taxing jurisdictions. We are under examination or engaged in tax litigation in many of these jurisdictions. The IRS is currently auditing our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2016-2018. In December 2020, the IRS completed the audit of our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2014-2015. The Company recognized a continuing operations benefit of million plus an additional net interest benefit of million. In addition, the Company recorded a benefit in discontinued operations of million of tax benefits and million of net interest benefits. See Note 2 for further information. 
 
 In September 2021, GE resolved its dispute with the United Kingdom tax authority, HM Revenue Customs (HMRC) in connection with interest deductions claimed by GE Capital for the years 2004-2015. As previously disclosed, HMRC had proposed to disallow interest deductions with a potential impact of approximately million, which included a possible assessment of tax and reduction of deferred tax assets, not including interest and penalties. As part of the settlement, GE and HMRC agreed that a portion of the interest deductions claimed were disallowed, with no fault or blame attributed to either party. The resolution concluded the dispute in its entirety without interest or penalties. The adjustments result in no current tax payment to HMRC, but a deferred tax charge of million as part of discontinued operations as a result of a reduction of available tax attributes, which had previously been recorded as deferred tax assets.

 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. tax reform), the U.S. has enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). We have not made an accrual for the deferred tax aspects of this provision. We also have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative net earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies of approximately billion that have been reinvested indefinitely. Given U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our prior unrepatriated net earnings were subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without additional federal tax cost, and any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the U.S. would potentially be partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations and it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2022, in connection with the execution of the Company s plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare, we incurred million of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings. 
 
 The total deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022 includes million related to the required capitalization of research costs for U.S. tax purposes effective January 1, 2022. The Company has pending accounting method changes which, if approved, are expected to offset the impact of this required capitalization. This deferred tax asset includes million related to GE HealthCare, which became a deferred asset of the separate company upon spin-off in the first quarter of 2023. In the event capitalization of research costs is adjusted through retroactive legislation effective for 2022, GE will record a tax provision benefit related to GE HealthCare research costs as a result of the benefit in the consolidated GE 2022 tax return without payment under the Tax Matters Agreement.

In addition, million and million were owned by our run-off insurance operations, primarily comprising of equity method investments at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase in investments in unconsolidated VIEs in our run-off insurance operations reflects strategic initiatives to invest in higher-yielding asset classes. Our maximum exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated VIEs is increased by our commitments to make additional investments in these entities described in Note 24. 

million at December 31, 2022. The commitments primarily comprise investments by our run-off insurance operations in investment securities and other assets of million and included within these commitments are obligations to make investments in unconsolidated VIEs of million.

 (a) The increase in current-year provisions is primarily related to Renewable Energy, which was substantially all due to changes in estimates on pre-existing warranties and related to the deployment of repairs and other corrective measures. 
 
 LEGAL MATTERS. In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial litigation, investigations and other legal, regulatory or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could have a material impact on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other parties and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated. 
 
 Alstom legacy legal matters. In 2015, we acquired the Steam Power, Renewables and Grid businesses from Alstom, which prior to our acquisition were the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. We had reserves of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be consistent with the reserve established. The estimation of this reserve may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this reserve. Factors that can affect the ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include the way cooperation is assessed and valued, prosecutorial discretion in the determination of damages, formulas for determining disgorgement, fines or penalties, the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and related matters could exceed the amount provided. 
 
 Shareholder and related lawsuits. Since November 2017, several putative shareholder class actions under the federal securities laws have been filed against GE and certain affiliated individuals and consolidated into a single action currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Hachem case). In October 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a fifth amended consolidated class action complaint naming as defendants GE and current and former GE executive officers. It alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 related to insurance reserves and accounting for long-term service agreements and seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who acquired GE stock between February 27, 2013 and January 23, 2018. GE filed a motion to dismiss in December 2019. In January 2021, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss as to the majority of the claims. Specifically, the court dismissed all claims related to insurance reserves, as well as all claims related to accounting for long-term service agreements, with the exception of certain claims about historic disclosures related to factoring in the Power business that survive as to GE and its former CFO Jeffrey S. Bornstein. All other individual defendants have been dismissed from the case. In April 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification for shareholders who acquired stock between February 26, 2016 and January 23, 2018, and granted the plaintiffs request to amend their complaint. In September 2022, GE filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims. 
 
 Since February 2018, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against current and former GE executive officers and members of GE s Board of Directors and GE (as nominal defendant). These lawsuits have alleged violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement, although the specific matters underlying the allegations in the lawsuits have varied. shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently pending: the Lindsey and Priest/Tola cases, which were filed in New York state court. The allegations in these cases relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Hachem case. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and improvements in GE s corporate governance and internal procedures. The Lindsey case has been stayed by agreement of the parties, and GE filed a motion to dismiss the Priest/Tola complaint in March 2021.

institutional investors who purchased GE common stock between August 1, 2014 and October 30, 2018 and rescission of those purchases. In May 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and GE in June 2021 filed a motion to dismiss that complaint. In September 2022, the court granted GE s motion to the dismiss the plaintiffs case with no opportunity to replead their case. In January 2023, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of the court s dismissal of their case with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 
 As previously reported by Baker Hughes, in March 2019, derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery naming as defendants GE, directors of Baker Hughes (including former members of GE s Board of Directors and current and former GE executive officers) and Baker Hughes (as nominal defendant), and the court issued an order consolidating these actions (the Schippnick case). The complaint as amended in May 2019 alleges, among other things, that GE and the Baker Hughes directors breached their fiduciary duties, and that GE was unjustly enriched by entering into transactions and agreements related to GE's sales of approximately of its ownership interest in Baker Hughes in November 2018. The complaint seeks declaratory relief, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest and attorneys fees and costs. In May 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the directors who were members of the Baker Hughes Conflicts Committee and a former Baker Hughes director. In October 2019, the Court denied the remaining defendants motions to dismiss, except with respect to the unjust enrichment claim against GE, which has been dismissed. In November 2019, the defendants filed their answer to the complaint, and a special litigation committee of the Baker Hughes Board of Directors moved for an order staying all proceedings in this action pending completion of the committee's investigation of the allegations and claims asserted in the complaint. In October 2020, the special litigation committee filed a report with the Court recommending that the derivative action be terminated. In January 2021, the special committee filed a motion to terminate the action. 
 
 GE Retirement Savings Plan class actions . putative class action lawsuits have been filed regarding the oversight of the GE RSP, and those class actions have been consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The consolidated complaint names as defendants GE, GE Asset Management, current and former GE and GE Asset Management executive officers and employees who served on fiduciary bodies responsible for aspects of the GE RSP during the class period. Like similar lawsuits that have been brought against other companies in recent years, this action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in their oversight of the GE RSP, principally by retaining five proprietary funds that plaintiffs allege were underperforming as investment options for plan participants and by charging higher management fees than some alternative funds. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of a class of GE RSP participants and beneficiaries from September 26, 2011 through the date of any judgment. In August and December 2018, the court issued orders dismissing one count of the complaint and denying GE's motion to dismiss the remaining counts. In September 2022, both GE and the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims. 
 
 Bank BPH . As previously reported, Bank BPH, along with other Polish banks, has been subject to ongoing litigation in Poland related to its portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loans, with cases brought by individual borrowers seeking relief related to their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans in various courts throughout Poland. At December 31, 2022, approximately of the Bank BPH portfolio is indexed to or denominated in foreign currencies (primarily Swiss francs), and the total portfolio had a carrying value, net of reserves, of million. We continue to observe an increase in the number of lawsuits being brought against Bank BPH and other banks in Poland, and we expect this to continue in future reporting periods. 

2022 FORM 10-K 79 

million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We update our assumptions underlying the amount of estimated losses based primarily on the number of lawsuits filed and estimated to be filed in the future, whether liability will be established in lawsuits and the nature of the remedy ordered by courts if liability is established. The increase in the amount of estimated losses during 2022 was driven primarily by increases in the number of lawsuits filed and estimated to be filed in the future and increased findings of liability. We expect the trends we have previously reported of an increasing number of lawsuits being filed, more findings of liability and more severe remedies being ordered against Polish banks (including Bank BPH) to continue in future reporting periods, although Bank BPH is unable at this time to develop a meaningful estimate of reasonably possible losses associated with active and inactive Bank BPH mortgage loans beyond the amounts currently recorded. Additional factors may also affect our estimated losses over time, including: potentially significant judicial decisions or binding resolutions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or the Polish Supreme Court; the impact of any of these or other future or recent decisions or resolutions (including an expected ECJ ruling that could adversely impact the remedy cost to Polish banks upon a finding of liability, and the Polish Supreme Court binding resolution delivered verbally in May 2021 with written reasoning issued in July 2021) on how Polish courts will interpret and apply the law in particular cases and how borrower behavior may change in response, neither of which are known immediately upon the issuance of a decision or resolution; financial, economic and other conditions in Poland that may adversely affect borrowers; uncertainty related to a proposal by the Chairman of the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority in December 2020 that banks voluntarily offer borrowers an opportunity to convert their foreign currency indexed or denominated mortgage loans to Polish zlotys using an exchange rate applicable at the date of loan origination, and about the various settlement strategies or other approaches that Polish banks have increasingly adopted or will adopt, or that Bank BPH may adopt in the future, in response to this proposal or other factors, the approaches that regulators and other government authorities will adopt in response, the receptivity of borrowers to settlement offers; and the financial and capital impact on banks that adopt settlement programs; and any potential legislation that may be passed in Poland relating to foreign exchange indexed or denominated mortgage loans. In addition, there is continued uncertainty arising from investigations of the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), including existing or anticipated UOKiK and court decisions resulting from those investigations, particularly UOKiK's investigation into the adequacy of disclosure of foreign exchange risk by banks (including BPH) and the legality under Polish law of unlimited foreign exchange risk on customers. Future adverse developments related to any of the foregoing, or other adverse developments such as actions by regulators, legislators or other governmental authorities (including UOKiK), likely would have a material adverse effect on Bank BPH and the carrying value of its mortgage loan portfolio as well as result in additional required capital contributions to Bank BPH or significant losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate. 
 
 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS . Our operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, involve the use, disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities, such as the Housatonic River cleanup described below, and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites, such as natural resource damages for the Hudson River where GE completed dredging in 2019. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Total reserves related to environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims were million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 As previously reported, in 2000, GE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) entered into a consent decree relating to PCB cleanup of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts. In October 2016, EPA issued its final decision pursuant to the consent decree. In January 2018, the EPA s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) remanded the decision back to the EPA with instruction to reissue a revised final remedy. After successful mediation with key stakeholders (including EPA, GE, certain towns, and environmental groups), public comment and further review by the EAB, the final revised permit (issued in January 2021) became effective in March 2022. In May 2022, two environmental advocacy groups petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review the EPA s final permit. As of December 31, 2022 and based on its assessment of current facts and circumstances and its defenses, GE believes that it has recorded adequate reserves to cover future obligations associated with the proposed final remedy. 
 
 for site remediation, nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claims amounted to approximately million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately million and million in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

of the outstanding shares of GE HealthCare to holders of GE common stock. On the Distribution Date, each holder of record of GE common stock received one share of GE HealthCare common stock for every three shares of GE common stock held. As a result of the Separation, GE HealthCare became an independent public company that trades under the symbol GEHC on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and we will no longer consolidate GE HealthCare into our financial results. 
 
 In connection with the Separation, the historical results of GE HealthCare and certain assets and liabilities included in the Separation will be reported in GE's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2023. GE will prospectively measure its retained ownership interest of approximately in GE HealthCare common stock at fair value. This equity ownership interest and the related earnings impact from subsequent changes in its fair value will be recognized in continuing operations. In addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in GE HealthCare over time. 
 
 Also in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and provide a framework for the relationship between GE and GE HealthCare, including a Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), a Tax Matters Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement (TSA). 
 
 In connection with the Separation and as a result of the legal split of certain plans as set forth in Note 13, net liabilities of approximately billion associated with GE's postretirement benefit plans, including a portion of the principal pension plans, the principal retiree benefit plans and other pension plans were transferred to GE HealthCare. Deferred compensation arrangements and other compensation and benefits obligations of approximately billion were also transferred to GE HealthCare. The legal split and transfer of the plans and the related liabilities and obligations to GE HealthCare will impact our assumptions and projections used to determine the funding and costs of GE s remaining plans. 
 
 In connection with the Separation, GE received billion of cash funded by GE HealthCare's additional billion of indebtedness incurred on January 3, 2023.

To be timely, a shareholder's notice of intention to make a nomination or to propose other business at the annual meeting must either (i) be sent to the Company in compliance with the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8, if the proposal is submitted under such rule, or (ii) if not, be mailed and received by, or delivered to, the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the 150th day and not later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary of the date the Company commenced mailing of its proxy materials in connection with the most recent annual meeting of shareholders 

or, if the date of the annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days earlier or later than the anniversary date of the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, then not later than the close of business on the earlier of (a) the 10th day after public disclosure of the meeting date, or (b) the 60th day prior to the date the Company commences mailing of its proxy materials in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders. 
 
 Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by GE s board of directors, or by the Secretary of the Company upon the written request therefor of shareholders holding ten percent of the then issued stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, filed with the Secretary of the Company. A shareholder request for a special meeting must state the purpose(s) of the proposed meeting and must include the information required for business to be properly brought by a shareholder before the annual meeting of shareholders as set forth in the By-laws with respect to any director nominations or other business proposed to be presented at such special meeting and as to the shareholder(s) requesting such meeting. Business transacted at a special meeting requested by shareholders will be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the request provided, however, that nothing in the Company By-Laws prohibits GE s board of directors from submitting matters to the shareholders at any special meeting requested by shareholders. 
 
 Our By-laws may be amended or repealed, and new By-laws may be adopted, by the shareholders or by GE s board of directors, except that GE s board of directors has no authority to amend or repeal any By-law which is adopted by the shareholders after April 20, 1948, unless such authority is granted to the GE board of directors by the specific provisions of a By-law adopted by the shareholders. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF EURO NOTES 
 
 The following description of the particular terms of the Euro Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. We encourage you to read the applicable indenture for additional information.

Wherever particular provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture or terms defined therein are referred to, such provisions or definitions are incorporated by reference as a part of the statements made and the statements are qualified in their entirety by such reference. 
 
 We may issue Euro Notes at any time and from time to time in one or more series under the Euro Notes Indenture. The Euro Notes Indenture give us the ability to reopen a previous issue 

of a series of Euro Notes and issue additional Euro Notes of the same series, subject to compliance with the applicable requirements set forth in the Euro Notes Indenture. The Euro Notes Indenture does not limit the amount of Euro Notes or other secured or unsecured debt that we or our subsidiaries may issue.

 Interest on the Euro Notes Generally 
 
 Interest on the Euro Notes is computed on the basis of (i) the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and (ii) the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on such series of Euro Notes, to but excluding the next scheduled Euro Notes Interest Payment Date for such series of Euro Notes, as the case may be. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Markets Association. 
 
 Interest payable on the Euro Notes on any Euro Notes Interest Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date shall be the amount of interest accrued from, and including, the next preceding Euro Notes Interest Payment Date for such series of Euro Notes in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, such Euro Notes Interest Payment Date, redemption date or maturity date, as the case may be. If any interest payment date for a Euro Note falls on a day that is not a business day, the interest payment will be made on the next succeeding day that is a business day, but no additional interest will accrue as a result of the delay in payment. If the maturity date or any redemption date of the Euro Note falls on a day that is not a business day, the related payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding business day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next succeeding business day. The rights of holders of beneficial interests of Euro Notes to receive the payments of interest on such notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. 
 
 Optional Redemption 

The Euro Notes of each series will be redeemable at any time prior to February 26, 2023 (in the case of the 2023 Notes), February 17, 2025 (in the case of the 2025 Notes), February 28, 2027 (in the case of the 2027 Notes), February 17, 2029 (in the case of the 2029 Notes) and February 17, 2037 (in the case of the 2037 Notes), as a whole or in part, at our option, on at least 30 days , but not more than 60 days , prior notice mailed (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream) to the registered address of each holder of the notes to be redeemed, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 
 
 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and 
 
 the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on an annual basis (ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below) in the case of the 2023 Notes, 15 basis points, in the case of the 2025 Notes, 15 basis points, in the case of the 2027 Notes 20 basis points, in the case of the 2029 Notes, 20 basis points, and, in the case of the 2037 Notes, 20 basis points together with, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed to, but not including, the date of redemption. 
 Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, we may redeem all or a portion of the Euro Notes of each series at our option at any time on or after February 26, 2023 (in the case of the 2023 Notes), February 17, 2025 (in the case of the 2025 Notes), February 28, 2027 (in the case of the 2027 Notes), February 17, 2029 (in the case of the 2029 Notes) and February 17, 2037 (in the case of the 2037 Notes), at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 
 If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all of the notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Euro Notes Trustee or paying agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on and after such redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on such notes (or such portion thereof) called for redemption. 
 
 Comparable Government Bond Rate means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the Comparable Government Bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11 00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us. 
 
 Comparable Government Bond means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the notes to be redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate. 
 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to each note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due 

after the related redemption date but for such redemption provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not a Euro Notes Interest Payment Date with respect to such Euro Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced (solely for the purposes of this calculation) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date. 
 
 We will, or will cause the Euro Notes Trustee on our behalf to, mail notice of a redemption to holders of the applicable notes to be redeemed by first-class mail (or otherwise transmit in accordance with applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream) at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the applicable series of notes or portions thereof called for redemption. On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with the paying agent or set aside, segregate and hold in trust (if we are acting as paying agent), funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, such notes to be redeemed on that redemption date. If fewer than all of the notes of such series are to be redeemed, the Euro Notes Trustee will select, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the particular notes or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding 
 notes not previously called by such method as the Euro Notes Trustee deems fair and appropriate provided that if the applicable notes are represented by one or more global notes, beneficial interests in the applicable notes will be selected for redemption by Euroclear and Clearstream in accordance with their respective standard procedures therefor provided, however, that no notes of a principal amount of 100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. 
 
 We may at any time, and from time to time, purchase Euro Notes of any series at any price or prices in the open market or otherwise. 
 
 Payment of Additional Amounts 
 
 We will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to or on account of a beneficial owner of a Euro Note who is not a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that every net payment by us of the principal of and interest on such Euro Note, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment, by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of the United States, will not be less than the amount that would have been payable had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, we will not pay additional amounts for or on account of 
 
 (a) any such tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner of a Euro Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such person, if such person is an estate, a trust, a partnership or a corporation) and the United States, including, without limitation, such person (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having, or having had, a permanent establishment therein or (ii) the presentation, where required, by the holder of any such Euro Note for payment on a date more than 15 calendar days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later 
 
 (b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge 

(c) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the holder or beneficial owner s past or present status as a personal holding company or foreign personal holding company or controlled foreign corporation or passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes or as a corporation which accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or as a private foundation or other tax-exempt organization 
 
 (d) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payments on or in respect of any Euro Note 
 
 (e) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with certification, information or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or beneficial owner of such Euro Note, if such compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the United States or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
 
 (f) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure by the holder or beneficial owner (or any financial institution through which the holder or beneficial owner holds any Euro Note or through which payment on the Euro Note is made) to comply with any certification, information, identification, documentation or other reporting requirements (including entering into and complying with an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service) imposed pursuant to, or complying with any requirements imposed under an intergovernmental agreement entered into between the United States and the government of another country in order to implement the requirements of, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect on the date of issuance of the Euro Notes or any successor or amended version of these provisions 
 
 (g) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of such beneficial owner s past or present status as the actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of GE or as a direct or indirect affiliate of GE 
 
 (h) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be deducted or withheld by any paying agent from a payment on a Euro Note upon presentation of such note, where required, if such payment can be made without such deduction or withholding upon presentation of such note, where required, to any other paying agent or any combination of two or more of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h), nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment on a Euro Note to a United States Alien Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to 

such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the additional amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of the Euro Note. 

The term United States Alien Holder means any beneficial owner of a Euro Note that is not, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or if such trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. Except as specifically provided under this heading Payment of Additional Amounts, we will not be required to make any payment for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision. 
 
 Redemption for Tax Reasons 
 
 The Euro Notes will mature and be redeemed at par on their respective maturity dates and are not redeemable prior to maturity except as described above under Optional Redemption or upon certain tax events described below. 
 
 We may redeem the Euro Notes prior to maturity in whole, but not in part, on not more than 60 days notice and not less than 30 days notice at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Euro Notes plus any accrued interest and additional amounts to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption if we determine that, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or 
 any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of issuance of the Euro Notes, we have or will become obligated to pay additional amounts with respect to the Euro Notes as described above under Payment of Additional Amounts . 
 
 If we exercise our option to redeem the Euro Notes, we will deliver to the Euro Notes Trustee a certificate signed by an authorized officer stating that we are entitled to redeem the Euro Notes and an opinion of independent tax counsel to the effect that the circumstances described above exist. 
 
 Issuance in Euros 
 
 All payments of interest and principal on the Euro Notes, including payments made upon any redemption of the Euro Notes, will be payable in euros. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Euro Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euro. Any payment in respect of the Euro Notes so made in U.S. dollars will 

not constitute an event of default under the Euro Notes or the Euro Notes Indenture. Neither the Euro Notes Trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. 
 
 As used herein, market exchange rate means the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of euros as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the United States Federal Reserve Board. 
 
 Additional Issues 
 
 We may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the holders of any series of Euro Notes, create and issue additional Euro Notes of such series ranking equally and ratably with such series of Euro Notes in all respects, or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of those additional Euro Notes provided that, if such additional Euro Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Euro Notes of the applicable series offered hereby, such additional Euro Notes will have a different ISIN and or any other identifying number. Any such additional Euro Notes will have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the applicable series of Euro Notes. 
 
 Book-Entry System 
 
 Global Clearance and Settlement 
 
 Each series of Euro Notes has been issued in the form of one or more global notes in fully registered form, without coupons, and deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear Bank S.A. N.V. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, soci t anonyme Clearstream ). Except as described herein, certificates will not be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the global notes. 
 
 Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to a common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee. 
 
 Beneficial interests in the global notes are represented, and transfers of such beneficial interests are effected, through accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Those beneficial interests are in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. Investors may hold Euro Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. 
 
 Owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to have Euro Notes registered in their names, and will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Euro Notes in definitive form. Except as provided below, beneficial owners will not be considered the owners or holders of the Euro Notes under the Euro Notes Indenture, including for purposes of receiving any reports delivered by us or the Euro Notes Trustee pursuant to the Euro Notes Indenture. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of the clearing systems and, if such person is not a participant of the clearing systems, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Euro Notes Indenture. Under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or a beneficial owner desires to give or take any action which a holder of Euro Notes is entitled to give or take under the Euro Notes Indenture, the clearing systems would authorize their participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take action and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to give or take such action or 

would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the clearing systems to their participants, by the participants to indirect participants and by the participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in certificated form. These limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in global notes. 
 
 Persons who are not Euroclear or Clearstream participants may beneficially own Euro Notes held by the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream only through direct or indirect participants in Euroclear and Clearstream. So long as the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream is the registered owner of the global note, the common depositary for all purposes will be considered the sole holder of the Euro Notes represented by the global note under the Euro Notes Indenture and the global notes. 
 
 Certificated Notes 
 
 If the applicable depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for any of the global notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 90 days, or if we have been notified that both Clearstream and Euroclear have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available, we will issue the Euro Notes in definitive form in exchange for the applicable global notes. We will also issue the Euro Notes in definitive form in exchange for the global notes if an event of default has occurred with regard to the Euro Notes represented by the global notes and has not been cured or waived. In addition, we may at any time and in our sole discretion determine not to have the Euro Notes represented by the global notes and, in that event, will issue the Euro Notes in definitive form in exchange for the global notes. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the global notes will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of the Euro Notes represented by the global notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Euro Notes registered in its name. The Euro Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued as registered in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 thereafter, unless otherwise specified by us. The Euro Notes in definitive form can be transferred by presentation for registration to the registrar at our office or 
 agency for such purpose and must be duly endorsed by the holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to us or the registrar duly executed by the holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. We may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of definitive Euro Notes. 
 
 The Euro Notes Trustee, Paying Agent, Calculation Agent, Transfer Agent and Security Registrar 
 
 The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee, transfer agent and security registrar with respect to the Euro Notes and maintains various commercial and investment banking relationships with us and with affiliates of ours. The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, will act as paying agent with respect to the Euro Notes. 

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Euro Notes will be payable at the office of the paying agent or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the holders of the Euro Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of holders provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the 

Euro Notes represented by one or more global notes deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear will be made through the facilities of the common depositary. We may change the paying agent without prior notice to the holders, and we or any of our subsidiaries may act as paying agent. 
 
 Ranking 
 
 The senior Euro Notes outstanding will 
 
 be general obligations, 
 
 rank equally with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of GE (except to the extent such other indebtedness is secured by collateral that does not also secure the Euro Notes), and 
 
 with respect to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries, effectively rank below all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 A substantial portion of our assets are owned through our subsidiaries, many of which have significant debt or other liabilities of their own which will be structurally senior to the Euro Notes. None of our subsidiaries will have any obligations with respect to the Euro Notes. Therefore, GE s rights and the rights of GE s creditors, including holders of Euro Notes, to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon any such subsidiary s liquidation may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s other creditors. 
 
 Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets 
 
 Under the Euro Notes Indenture, we may not consolidate with or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease our properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, any person (as defined below), referred to as a successor person unless 
 
 the successor person expressly assumes our obligations with respect to the Euro Notes Indenture and the debt securities issued thereunder, 
 
 immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing, and 
 
 we have delivered to the Euro Notes Trustee the certificates and opinions required under the Euro Notes Indenture. 
 As used in the Euro Notes Indenture, the term person means any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization, government or agency or political subdivision thereof. 
 
 Events of Default 
 
 Each of the following will be an event of default under the Euro Notes Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities issued thereunder 
 
 our failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on that series of debt securities when such principal or premium, if any, becomes due, 

our failure to pay any interest on that series of debt securities for 30 days after such interest becomes due, 
 
 our failure to deposit any sinking fund payment for 30 days after such payment is due by the terms of that series of debt securities, 
 
 our failure to perform, or our breach, in any material respect, of any other covenant or warranty in the Euro Notes Indenture with respect to that series of debt securities, other than a covenant or warranty included in the Euro Notes Indenture solely for the benefit of another series of debt securities, for 90 days after either the Euro Notes Trustee has given us or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have given us and the Euro Notes Trustee written notice of such failure to perform or breach in the manner required by the Euro Notes Indenture, 
 
 specified events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, or 
 
 any other event of default we may provide for that series of debt securities, 
 provided, however, that no event described in the fourth bullet point above will be an event of default until an officer of the Euro Notes Trustee responsible for the administration of the Euro Notes Indenture has actual knowledge of the event or until the Euro Notes Trustee receives written notice of the event at its corporate trust office. 
 An event of default under one series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default under any other series of debt securities. If an event of default for a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, either the Euro Notes Trustee or the holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the debt securities of that series due and immediately payable by a notice in writing to us (and to the Euro Notes Trustee if given by the holders). Upon such declaration, we will be obligated to pay the principal amount of that series of debt securities. 
 
 The right described in the preceding paragraph does not apply if an event of default occurs as described in the sixth bullet point above which applies to all outstanding series of debt securities. If such an event of default occurs and is continuing, either the Euro Notes Trustee or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of all of the debt securities then outstanding, treated as one class, may declare the principal amount of all of the debt securities then outstanding to be due and payable immediately by a notice in writing to us (and to the Euro Notes Trustee if given by the holders). Upon such declaration, we will be obligated to pay the principal amount of the debt securities. 
 
 After any declaration of acceleration of a series of debt securities, but before a judgment or decree for payment has been obtained, the event of default giving rise to the declaration of 
 acceleration will, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences will, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled if 
 
 we have paid or deposited with the Euro Notes Trustee a sum sufficient to pay 
 
 all overdue interest, 
 
 the principal and premium, if any, due otherwise than by the declaration of acceleration and any interest on such amounts, 
 
 any interest on overdue interest, to the extent legally permitted, and 

all amounts due to the Euro Notes Trustee under the Euro Notes Indenture, and 
 
 all events of default with respect to that series of debt securities, other than the nonpayment of the principal which became due solely by virtue of the declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived. 
 If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Euro Notes Trustee will generally have no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Euro Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless the holders offer reasonable indemnity to the Euro Notes Trustee. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will generally have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Euro Notes Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Euro Notes Trustee for the debt securities of that series, provided that 
 
 the direction is not in conflict with any law or the Euro Notes Indenture, 
 
 the Euro Notes Trustee may take any other action it deems proper which is not inconsistent with the direction, and 
 
 the Euro Notes Trustee will generally have the right to decline to follow the direction if an officer of the Euro Notes Trustee determines, in good faith, that the proceeding would involve the Euro Notes Trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law. 
 A holder of a debt security of any series may only pursue a remedy under the Euro Notes Indenture if 
 
 the holder gives the Euro Notes Trustee written notice of a continuing event of default for that series, 
 
 holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series make a written request to the Euro Notes Trustee to institute proceedings with respect to such event of default, 
 
 the holders offer reasonable indemnity to the Euro Notes Trustee, 
 
 the Euro Notes Trustee fails to pursue that remedy within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request and offer of indemnity, and 
 
 during that 60-day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series do not give the Euro Notes Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request. 
 However, these limitations do not apply to a suit by a holder of a debt security demanding payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on a debt security on or after the date the payment is due. 
 
 We are required to furnish to the Euro Notes Trustee annually a statement by some of our officers regarding our performance or observance of any of the terms of the Euro Notes Indenture and specifying all of our known defaults, if any. 

Modification and Waiver 
 
 When authorized by a board resolution, we may enter into one or more supplemental indentures with the Euro Notes Trustee without the consent of the holders of the debt securities in order to 
 evidence the succession of another person to us, or successive successions, and the assumption of our covenants, agreements and obligations by the successor, 
 
 add to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of any series of debt securities or to surrender any of our rights or powers, add any additional events of default for any series of debt securities for the benefit of the holders of any series of debt securities, 
 
 add to or change any provision of the Euro Notes Indenture to the extent necessary to issue debt securities in bearer form or uncertificated form, 
 
 add to, change or eliminate any provision of the Euro Notes Indenture applying to one or more series of debt securities, provided that if such action adversely affects the interests of any holder of any series of debt securities in any material respect, such addition, change or elimination will become effective with respect to that series only when no such security of that series remains outstanding, 
 
 convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property to or with the Euro Notes Trustee or to surrender any right or power conferred upon us by the Euro Notes Indenture, 
 
 establish the forms or terms of any series of debt securities, 
 
 provide for uncertificated securities in addition to certificated securities, 
 
 evidence and provide for successor trustees and to add to or change any provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture to the extent necessary to appoint a separate trustee or trustees for a specific series of debt securities, 
 
 correct any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency under the Euro Notes Indenture, 
 
 make other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Euro Notes Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of debt securities in any material respect, 
 
 supplement any provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture necessary to defease and discharge any series of debt securities, provided that such action does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any series of debt securities in any material respect, 
 
 comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which any debt securities are listed or traded, 
 
 add to, change or eliminate any provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or interests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect, or 

provide for the payment by us of additional amounts in respect of taxes imposed on certain holders and for the treatment of such additional amounts as interest and for all matters incidental thereto. 
 
 When authorized by a board resolution, we may enter into one or more supplemental indentures with the Euro Notes Trustee in order to add to, change or eliminate provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture or to modify the rights of the holders of one or more series of debt securities under the Euro Notes Indenture if we obtain the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture, treated as one class. However, without the consent of the holders of each outstanding debt security affected by the supplemental indenture, we may not enter into a supplemental indenture that 
 
 except with respect to the reset of the interest rate or extension of maturity pursuant to the terms of a particular series, changes the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any debt security, or reduces the principal amount of, or any premium or rate of interest on, any debt security, 
 
 reduces the amount of principal of an original issue discount security or any other debt security payable upon acceleration of the maturity thereof, 
 
 changes the place or currency of payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, 
 
 impairs the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after such payment becomes due for any debt security, 
 
 reduces the percentage in principal amount of outstanding debt securities of any series, the consent of whose holders is required for modification of the Euro Notes Indenture, for waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture or for waiver of certain defaults of the Euro Notes Indenture, 
 
 makes certain modifications to the provisions for modification of the Euro Notes Indenture and for certain waivers, except to increase the principal amount of debt securities necessary to consent to any such change or to provide that certain other provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holders of each outstanding debt security affected by such change, 
 
 makes any change that adversely affects in any material respect the right to convert or exchange any convertible or exchangeable debt security or decreases the conversion or exchange rate or increases the conversion price of such debt security, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of such debt securities, or 

changes the terms and conditions pursuant to which any series of debt securities are secured in a manner adverse to the holders of such debt securities in any material respect. 
 Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may waive past defaults or noncompliance with restrictive provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture. However, the consent of holders of each outstanding debt security of a series is required to 
 
 waive any default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, or 

waive any covenants and provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture that may not be amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of the series affected. 
 In order to determine whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding debt securities have taken an action under the Euro Notes Indenture as of a specified date 
 the principal amount of an original issue discount security that will be deemed to be outstanding will be the amount of the principal that would be due and payable as of that date upon acceleration of the maturity to that date, 
 
 if, as of that date, the principal amount payable at the stated maturity of a debt security is not determinable, for example, because it is based on an index, the principal amount of the debt security deemed to be outstanding as of that date will be an amount determined in the manner prescribed for the debt security, 
 
 the principal amount of a debt security denominated in one or more foreign currencies or currency units that will be deemed to be outstanding will be the U.S.-dollar equivalent, determined as of that date in the manner prescribed for the debt security, of the principal amount of the debt security or, in the case of a debt security described in the two preceding bullet points, of the amount described above, and 
 
 debt securities owned by us or any other obligor upon the debt securities or any of our or their affiliates will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding. 
 
 An original issue discount security means a debt security issued under the Euro Notes Indenture which provides for an amount less than the principal amount thereof to be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of maturity. Some debt securities, including those for the payment or redemption of which money has been deposited or set aside in trust for the holders, and those which have been legally defeased under the Euro Notes Indenture, will not be deemed to be outstanding. 
 
 We will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for determining the holders of outstanding debt securities of any series entitled to give or take any direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action under the Euro Notes Indenture. In limited circumstances, the Euro Notes Trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders of outstanding debt securities. If a record date is set for any action to be taken by holders of a particular series, the action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding debt securities of that series on the record date. To be effective, the action must be taken by holders of the requisite principal amount of debt securities within a specified period following the record date. For any particular record date, this period will be 180 days or such shorter period as we may specify, or the Euro Notes Trustee may specify, if it sets the record date. This period may be shortened or lengthened by not more than 180 days. 
 
 Defeasance 
 
 Subject to the exceptions, and subject to compliance with the applicable requirements set forth in the Euro Notes Indenture, we may discharge our obligations under the Euro Notes Indenture with respect to any series of Euro Notes as described below. 
 
 When we use the term defeasance, we mean discharge from some or all of our obligations under the Euro Notes Indenture. If we deposit with the Euro Notes Trustee funds or government 

securities sufficient to make payments on the debt securities of a series on the dates those payments are due and payable and comply with all other conditions to defeasance set forth in the Euro Notes Indenture, then, at our option, either of the following will occur 
 
 we will be discharged from our obligations with respect to the debt securities of that series legal defeasance ), or 
 
 we will no longer have any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants under the Euro Notes Indenture, and the related events of default will no longer apply to us, but some of our other obligations under the Euro Notes Indenture and the debt securities of that series, including our obligation to make payments on those debt securities, will survive covenant defeasance ). 
 
 If we legally defease a series of debt securities, the holders of the debt securities of the series affected will not be entitled to the benefits of the Euro Notes Indenture, except for 
 
 the rights of holders of that series of debt securities to receive, solely from a trust fund, payments in respect of such debt securities when payments are due, 
 
 our obligation to register the transfer or exchange of debt securities, 
 
 our obligation to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, and 
 
 our obligation to maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust. 
 We may legally defease a series of debt securities notwithstanding any prior exercise of our option of covenant defeasance in respect of such series. 
 
 We will be required to deliver to the Euro Notes Trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities to recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes and that the holders would be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related defeasance had not occurred. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect. 
 
 Satisfaction and Discharge 
 
 We may discharge our obligations under the Euro Notes Indenture while securities remain outstanding if (1) all outstanding debt securities issued under the Euro Notes Indenture have become due and payable, (2) all outstanding debt securities issued under the Euro Notes Indenture will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year of the date of deposit or (3) all outstanding debt securities issued under the Euro Notes Indenture are scheduled for redemption in one year, and in each case, we have deposited with the Euro Notes Trustee an amount sufficient to pay and discharge all outstanding debt securities issued under the Euro Notes Indenture on the date of their scheduled maturity or the scheduled date of the redemption and paid all other amounts payable under the Euro Notes Indenture. 
 
 Highly Leveraged Transaction 
 
 The general provisions of the Euro Notes Indenture do not afford holders of the debt securities issued thereunder protection in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction involving GE that may adversely affect holders of the debt securities. 

Notices 
 Notices to holders of the Euro Notes will be sent by mail or email to the registered holders, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the applicable depositary. 
 
 Title 
 We may treat the person in whose name a debt security is registered on the applicable record date as the owner of the debt security for all purposes, whether or not it is overdue. 
 
 Governing Law 
 
 The Euro Notes Indenture and the Euro Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 
 
 Regarding the Trustee 
 
 GE and affiliates of GE maintain various commercial and investment banking relationships with The Bank of New York Mellon and its affiliates in their ordinary course of business. The Bank of New York Mellon also acts as trustee under certain other indentures with GE and its affiliates. 
 
 If an event of default occurs under the Euro Notes Indenture and is continuing, the Euro Notes Trustee will be required to use the degree of care and skill of a prudent person in the conduct of that person s own affairs. The Euro Notes Trustee will become obligated to exercise any of its powers under the Euro Notes Indenture at the request of any of the holders of any debt securities issued under the Euro Notes Indenture only after those holders have offered the Euro Notes Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it. 
 
 If the Euro Notes Trustee becomes one of our creditors, its rights to obtain payment of claims in specified circumstances, or to realize for its own account on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise will be limited under the terms of the Euro Notes Indenture. The Euro Notes Trustee may engage in certain other transactions however, if the Euro Notes Trustee acquires any conflicting interest (within the meaning specified under the Trust Indenture Act), it will be required to eliminate the conflict or resign. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF DOLLAR NOTES 
 
 The following description of the particular terms of the Dollar Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. We encourage you to read the applicable indenture for additional information. 
 
 General 
 
 The Dollar Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of August 1, 1995 (the Dollar Notes Base Indenture ), by and among GECS, GE, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), as trustee (the Dollar Notes Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 22, 2012, pursuant to which General Electric Capital Corporation GECC succeeded to and assumed the full outstanding principal amount of the Dollar Notes (the Dollar Notes Base Indenture as so supplemented, the Dollar Notes Indenture ). In 2015, the Dollar Notes were assumed by GE upon its merger with GECC. 

As of January 31, 2022, a total of 210,896,000 aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes was outstanding. The Dollar Notes will mature on August 21, 2035. The Dollar Notes bear interest from August 21, 1995 at the annual rate of 7 1 2 , payable semi-annually on February 21 and August 21 of each year (each, a Dollar Notes Interest Payment Date ), to the persons in whose names the Dollar Notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding February 7 and August 7, respectively. The Dollar Notes Indenture does not limit the amount of Dollar Notes or other unsecured, subordinated debt which may be issued thereunder or limit the amount of other debt, secured or unsecured, whether junior or senior to, or pari passu with, the Dollar Notes which may be issued by GE, and no other indenture or instrument to which GE is a party limits the amount of other debt, secured or unsecured, senior to the Dollar Notes which may be issued by GE. 
 
 The statements under this heading are subject to the detailed provisions of the Dollar Notes Indenture. Wherever particular provisions of the Dollar Notes Indenture or terms defined therein are referred to, such provisions or definitions are incorporated by reference as a part of the statements made and the statements are qualified in their entirety by such reference. 
 
 Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In any case where a Dollar Notes Interest Payment Date or the date of maturity of the principal on the Dollar Notes shall not be a business day, then payment of principal or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding day which is a business day, with the same force and effect as if made on such Dollar Notes Interest Payment Date or the date of maturity, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date. The term business day as used with respect to the Dollar Notes means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions are generally authorized or obligated by law or regulation to close in The City of New York. 
 
 The Dollar Notes are unsecured and will be subordinated in right of payment to all Superior Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company as set forth in the Dollar Notes Indenture. 
 
 No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of the Dollar Notes, but the GE may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
 
 Listing 
 
 The Dollar Notes are listed on the NYSE. We have no obligation to maintain such listing, and we may delist the Dollar Notes at any time. 
 
 Global Notes, Delivery and Form 
 
 The Dollar Notes are represented by one or more fully registered global notes that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (the Depository and registered in the name of the Depository s nominee. 
 
 Beneficial interests in the global note will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by the Depository (in respect of its participants) and by its participants. Except as described herein, Dollar Notes in definitive form will not be issued. Except as set forth below, the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of the Depository or to a successor of the Depository or its nominee. 

The Depository has advised as follows it is a limited-purpose trust company which was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (the Participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions in such securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the Depository s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly indirect participants ). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by the Depository only through Participants or indirect participants. 
 
 The Depository advises that pursuant to procedures established by it ownership of beneficial interests in the global note will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by the Depository (with respect to Participants), by the Participants (with respect to indirect participants and certain beneficial owners) and by the indirect participants (with respect to all other beneficial owners). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities which they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in the global note is limited to such extent. 
 
 So long as a nominee of the Depository is the registered owner of the global note, such nominee for all purposes will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Dollar Notes under the Dollar Notes Indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in the global note will not be entitled to have Dollar Notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Dollar Notes in definitive form, and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof under the Dollar Notes Indenture. 
 
 Neither GE, the Dollar Notes Trustee, any paying agent nor any registrar of the Dollar Notes will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global note, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. 
 
 Principal and interest payments on the Dollar Notes registered in the name of the Depository s nominee will be made in immediately available funds to the Depository s nominee as the registered owner of the global note. Under the terms of the Dollar Notes Indenture, GE and the Dollar Notes Trustee will treat the persons in whose names the Dollar Notes are registered as the owners of such Dollar Notes for the purpose of receiving payment of principal and interest on such Dollar Notes and for all other purposes whatsoever. Therefore, neither GE, the Dollar Notes Trustee nor any paying agent has any direct responsibility or liability for the payment of principal or interest on the Dollar Notes to owners of beneficial interests in the global note. The Depository has advised GE and the Dollar Notes Trustee that its current practice is, upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest, to immediately credit the accounts of the Participants with such payment in amounts proportionate to their respective holdings in principal amount of beneficial interests in the global note as shown in the records of the Depository. The Depository s current practice is to credit such accounts, as to interest, in next-day funds and, as to principal, in same-day funds. Payments by Participants and indirect participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in street name , and will be the responsibility of the Participants or indirect participants. 
 
 If the Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, the Company will issue 

Dollar Notes in definitive form in exchange for the global note. In addition, the Company may at any time determine not to have the Dollar Notes represented by a global note and, in such event, will issue Dollar Notes in definitive form in exchange for the global note. In either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the global note will be entitled to have Dollar Notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest registered in its name and will be entitled to physical delivery of such Dollar Notes in definitive form. Dollar Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued in denominations of 1,000 and integral multiples thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. 
 
 Same-Day Settlement 
 
 The Dollar Notes will trade in the Depository's Same-Day Funds Settlement System until maturity, and secondary market trading activity in the Dollar Notes will therefore settle in immediately available funds. No assurance can be given as to the effect, if any, of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the Dollar Notes. 
 
 Subordination 
 
 The Dollar Notes are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Dollar Notes Indenture, to all indebtedness for borrowed money of GE, whether currently outstanding or hereafter incurred, which is not by its terms subordinate to other indebtedness of GE (the Superior Indebtedness ). In the event of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, and any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings in connection therewith, relative to GE or its property, and, except as otherwise provided in the Dollar Notes Indenture, in the event of any proceedings for voluntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of GE, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, all principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Superior Indebtedness will be paid in full before any payment is made by GE on the Dollar Notes. In the event that pursuant to the terms of the Dollar Notes Indenture the Dollar Notes are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of an Event of Default, as provided in the Dollar Notes Indenture, and the previous sentence is not applicable, the holders of the Dollar Notes shall be entitled to payment from GE only after the Superior Indebtedness outstanding at the time the Dollar Notes so becomes due and payable because of such Event of Default shall first have been paid in full or such payment shall have been provided for. 
 
 In addition, although the Dollar Notes are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness for borrowed money of the subsidiaries of GE to unaffiliated third parties (the Subsidiary Indebtedness ), the Subsidiary Indebtedness is structurally superior in right of payment to the Dollar Notes. 
 
 Modification of the Dollar Notes Indenture 
 
 The Dollar Notes Indenture contains provisions permitting GE and the Dollar Notes Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2 3 in aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes at the time outstanding, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Dollar Notes Indenture or any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of Dollar Notes, provided that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things (i) extend the fixed maturity of the Dollar Notes or reduce the principal amount thereof (including the amount payable upon acceleration of the maturity thereof), reduce the redemption premium thereon or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, without the consent of the holder of each Dollar Note so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of such 

Dollar Notes, the consent of the holders of which is required for any supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holder of each such Dollar Note so affected. 
 
 Events of Default 
 
 An Event of Default with respect to the Dollar Notes is defined in the Dollar Notes Indenture as being default in payment of any principal or premium, if any, on any Dollar Notes default for 30 days in payment of any interest on any Dollar Notes default in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation on the Dollar Notes default for 60 days after notice in performance of any other covenant in respect of the Dollar Notes in the Dollar Notes Indenture a default, as defined, with respect to any other series of notes outstanding under the Dollar Notes Indenture or as defined in any other indenture or instrument evidencing or under which GE has outstanding any indebtedness for borrowed money, as a result of which such other series or such other indebtedness of GE shall have been accelerated and such acceleration shall not have been annulled within 10 days after written notice thereof (provided, that under the Dollar Notes Indenture the resulting Event of Default with respect to such series may be remedied, cured or waived by the remedying, curing or waiving of such other default under such other series or such other indebtedness) or certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization in respect of GE. The Dollar Notes Indenture requires GE to file with the Dollar Notes Trustee annually a written statement as to the presence or absence of certain defaults under the terms thereof. No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of notes under the Dollar Notes Indenture necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of notes issued thereunder. 
 
 The Dollar Notes Indenture provides that if an Event of Default with respect to the Dollar Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Dollar Notes Trustee thereunder or the holders of 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Dollar Notes may declare the principal of all the Dollar Notes to be due and payable immediately, but under certain conditions such declaration may be annulled by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Dollar Notes then outstanding. The Dollar Notes Indenture provides that past defaults with respect to the Dollar Notes (except, unless theretofore cured, a default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any of the Dollar Notes, or the payment of any sinking fund instalment or analogous obligation on the Dollar Notes) may be waived on behalf of the holders of all the Dollar Notes by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Dollar Notes then outstanding. 
 
 The Dollar Notes Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Dollar Notes Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the holders of Dollar Notes issued thereunder unless such holders shall have offered to the Dollar Notes Trustee reasonable indemnity. The Dollar Notes Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued thereunder at the time outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available 
 to the Dollar Notes Trustee thereunder, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Dollar Notes Trustee, with respect to the Dollar Notes, provided that the Dollar Notes Trustee may decline to follow any such direction if it determines that the proceedings so directed would be illegal or involve it in any personal liability. 
 
 Certain Covenants of the Company

 2. Affiliate means any corporation or business entity owned in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by General Electric Company.

Any change to an individual s status by reason of such reclassification or subsequent treatment will apply prospectively only. 
 7. Employer means General Electric Company and any other Affiliate, or any successor or successors of an Affiliate, that with the approval of the Plan Sponsor, adopts the Plan. 
 8. Executive means an Employee who has been classified by the Employer as an Officer Band Company Employee.

 15. Plan Sponsor means General Electric Company. 
 16. Policy means the universal life insurance policy issued on the life of the Participant in connection with this Plan. 
 17. Premium Bonus has the meaning set forth in Section 7.2. 
 18. Retire or Retirement has the meaning set forth in Section 8.2(c). 
 19. Retirement-Eligible has the meaning set forth in Section 8.2. 
 20. Voluntary Premium Contribution has the meaning set forth in Section 7.4. 
 3. ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT 
 3.1 Eligibility Requirements. The Plan is closed to new participants as of January 1, 2020 (the Closing Date ). Therefore, in order to be eligible to participate in the Plan, the Employee must have been a Participant in the Plan as of the Closing Date. To be a Participant in the Plan as of the Closing Date, the Employee must have been a Participant on December 31, 2019. 
 (a) Eligibility Requirements Before January 1, 2020. Before January 1, 2020, in order to be eligible to participate in the Plan, an Employee must have (i) been hired as, or promoted to, an Executive position before January 1, 2018 and (ii) have been Actively-at-Work on the date that coverage was scheduled to begin. Actively-at-Work has the meaning given to that term under the Policy. If an Executive did not meet the Actively-at-Work requirement when he was first eligible to participate in the Plan, he would have been eligible for coverage as soon as he met the Actively-at-Work requirement. 
 3.2 Enrollment Procedure . When an Executive became eligible to participate in the Plan, he received an enrollment kit from the Plan Administrator. The kit contained 
 (a) A personalized life insurance exhibit showing illustrative projections of the benefits and cost of the life insurance Policy 
 (b) A Plan participation election form 
 (c) An application for the Policy 
 (d) A form for Certification of Trustee(s) and Proposed Insured, which was required if the Executive elected to assign the ownership of his Policy to a trust and 
 (e) An Illustration Certification. 
 2 

The Executive must have completed the forms and returned them to the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days to have enrolled in the Plan. This was the Executive s only opportunity to enroll in the Plan without providing evidence of good health unless the Executive could not meet the Actively-at-Work requirement . An eligible Employee who did not enroll in the Plan when first eligible could enroll later upon providing evidence of good health to the satisfaction of the Insurer if the Employee met the eligibility requirements described in Section 3.1 and continued to be an Executive. 
 3.3 Effective Date of Coverage . The coverage under the Plan began as soon as practicable after the Executive completed and returned the enrollment forms to the Plan Administrator, the form was accepted by the Insurer and the required premiums were paid. The Policy had an issue date of April 1 coincident with or immediately following the date on which the Executive became eligible to participate in the Plan and began accumulating cash value on that issue date. The Executive was provided with temporary term insurance coverage between the coverage start date and the Policy issue date. However, that temporary term insurance coverage did not accumulate any cash value. 
 3.4 Effect of Smoking Habit . The coverage under the Plan is provided by a universal life insurance policy that uses smoker-distinct rates for insurance coverage. As prescribed by Section 7.1, the Premium Bonuses provided by the Company are based on the rates applicable to non-smokers, which are lower than those applicable to smokers. Consequently, a Policy for a Participant who is a smoker will develop lower cash value than a Policy that covers an otherwise identical Participant who is a non-smoker. The owner of a Policy insuring a Participant classified as a smoker may request a change in the Policy to non-smoker status if the Participant has ceased using all tobacco products for at least one year. Any change in smoker status is subject to the Insurer s approval and the effect on the insurance rates will be prospective only. 
 4. LIFE INSURANCE POLICY RIGHTS 
 4.1 Ownership . The coverage under the Plan is provided through a universal life insurance policy. The Participant will be the owner of the life insurance policy unless he assigns ownership to a trust or another person. The Policy may be assigned in accordance with its terms. Any assignment shall be effective only after the Insurer receives the properly completed assignment form, and only if the form is received while the Participant is still alive. 
 4.2 Beneficiary Designation . The owner of the Policy may designate a beneficiary to receive life insurance benefits under the Policy. If the owner fails to name a beneficiary or if all of the named beneficiaries pre-decease the Participant or are deemed to die contemporaneously with the Participant, then the Participant s estate shall be the beneficiary. 
 The owner of the Policy can change the beneficiary designation at any time. Any beneficiary designation shall be effective only after the Insurer receives the properly completed designation form, and only if the form is received while the Participant is still alive. 
 4.3 Cash Value Account . The Plan is designed such that the Policy will accumulate cash value to provide for continuation of coverage after Retirement. The owner of the Policy owns all of the cash value in the Policy. 
 5. AMOUNT OF COVERAGE WHILE EMPLOYED 
 5.1 Coverage Formula . The initial benefit amount shall be 1,000,000 for all Vice Presidents and 2,000,000 for all Senior Vice Presidents. On the Benefit Adjustment Date each year, the amount of coverage will be increased by 4 , provided that the Participant on that date (i) is employed by the Company, (ii) satisfies the Actively-at-Work requirement, (iii) has not 
 3 

yet attained age 60 and (iv) has participated in the Plan for at least one year. The Benefit Adjustment Date shall be April 1 of each year. 
 5.2 Evidence of Insurability . An Executive who enrolled in the Plan when first eligible and before January 1, 2020, as described in Section 3.1, was eligible to receive the initial coverage and any annual increases in coverage without providing evidence of good health provided that, with respect to the increases, the Executive met the conditions stipulated in Section 5.1. An Executive who did not enroll in the Plan when first eligible may have been able to enroll later upon providing evidence of good health to the satisfaction of the Insurer if the Employee met the applicable eligibility requirements described in Sections 3.1 and 5.1, continued to be an Executive, and otherwise enrolled before January 1, 2020. An Executive who enrolled late in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence was eligible to receive the initial benefit amount and any annual increases in coverage that the Executive would have received if the Executive had enrolled when first eligible. 
 6. TARGET AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AFTER RETIREMENT 
 6.1 Target Amount of Post-Retirement Coverage . In general, the target post-Retirement amount of coverage for a Participant is the highest coverage amount attained while a Participant (prior to Plan Maturity Date). 
 6.2 Retirement or Disability Prior to Plan Maturity Date . Participation in the Plan ends on the Plan Maturity Date. If a Participant has not yet reached his Plan Maturity Date when he Retires or becomes disabled, he will continue to be eligible to participate in the Plan until the earlier of the Plan Maturity Date or the date his Participation ends for a reason described in Section 8. While a Participant, the Company will continue to pay Premium Bonuses (in the case of Retirement) or pay Policy premiums (in the case of disability) in accordance with the Plan up to the Plan Maturity Date. During this period, the amount of coverage under the Policy will equal the amount in force at the onset of Retirement or disability. 
 7. PLAN BENEFITS 
 7.1 Determination of Annual Premiums . The annual premiums for each Participant s Policy will be actuarially determined (using actuarial assumptions, including whether the Participant is classified as a non-smoker by the Insurer) so that each Participant (i) pays for the cost of the current life insurance benefit, as described in Section 5 and (ii) adds to the cash value an actuarially determined amount, so that on the Plan Maturity Date, the cash value will have accumulated to an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide a level of paid-up insurance (in an amount described in Section 6) until December 31 of the year in which the Participant turns age 94 provided that, for a Participant hired or promoted to Executive on or after January 1, 2008, the cash value will have accumulated to an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide a level of paid-up insurance until December 31 of the year in which the Participant turns age 84. However, there is no guarantee that the annual premiums will result in a cash value that is sufficient to provide a level of paid-up insurance through these ages. 
 7.2 Premium Bonus . The owner of the Policy is required to pay the annual premium for the Policy by April 1 of each calendar year, except to the extent provided in Sections 7.3, 8.4, and 8.5. While the Executive is a Participant, the Company will either pay the Participant a taxable annual Premium Bonus to facilitate the Participant s payment of premiums for the Policy or, in the case of a Participant on a leave of absence or disability, pay the premium to the extent provided in Section 8.4 or Section 8.5. Except to the extent provided in Section 7.3, the Company will pay the Premium Bonus each calendar year generally on or about the premium due date. The amount of the Premium Bonus will equal the annual premium described in Section 
 4 

7.1. No premiums or Premium Bonuses will be calculated or paid for a period after the Plan Maturity Date. 
 7.3 Six-Month Delay . To the extent a Participant is a specified employee, within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, and any Premium Bonus is deemed to be deferred compensation paid on account of his separation from service (under 409A), the Company will pay any Premium Bonus, otherwise payable within 6 months following his separation from service, on the date that is 6 months following the Participant s separation from service. The Participant shall be in compliance with the terms of the Plan if he pays the annual premium for the Policy at that time. 
 7.4 Voluntary Premium Contributions . A Participant or owner of a Policy may pay voluntary premiums to the Policy, subject to prior approval from the Insurer provided that a Participant or owner of a Policy may not pay any premiums to the Policy in excess of the required premiums while the Company is either paying the Participant a taxable annual Premium Bonus or, in the case of a Participant on a leave of absence or disability, paying the premium to the extent provided in Section 8.4 or Section 8.5. 
 8. TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION 
 8.1 Length of Cost Sharing and Plan Participation . A Participant shall continue to participate in the Plan and receive the Premium Bonuses or premium payments, as applicable, until the earliest of 
 (a) The Plan Maturity Date or 
 (b) Other events enumerated below 
 1. The Participant separates from service with all Employers prior to Retirement-Eligibility, unless such separation is due to disability 
 2. The owner of the Policy (as described in Section 4.1) exercises any policy ownership rights that would change the coverage (including complete or partial surrenders, loans, or withdrawals) 
 3. The Participant s employment position is downgraded from an Executive position prior to Retirement-Eligibility 
 4. The owner of the Policy fails to pay the premiums described in Section 7.1 when due 
 5. The Participant otherwise does not abide by the rules of the Plan 
 6. The Participant requests that participation be terminated or 
 7. The Plan Sponsor terminates the Plan or Premium Bonuses in accordance with Section 9. 
 8.2 Participation at Retirement . The following rules apply at Retirement 
 (c) On or After Plan Maturity Date . If a Participant Retires on or after his Plan Maturity Date, the Company will not pay any additional Premium Bonuses. All of the 
 5 

annual premiums scheduled for the Policy under the Plan will have been completed by the Plan Maturity Date. 
 (d) Prior to Plan Maturity Date . If a Participant Retires prior to his Plan Maturity Date, he will continue to be eligible to participate in the Plan, meaning that the Company will continue to pay him Premium Bonuses in accordance with the Plan until his Plan Maturity Date. The amount of coverage during the period between Retirement and the Plan Maturity Date is specified in Section 6.2. 
 (e) Definition of Retirement . Retirement means separation from service with the Company after becoming Retirement-Eligible. A Company Employee is Retirement-Eligible as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, upon turning age 60 and completing 10 years of continuous service. 
 8.3 Borrowing or Withdrawing Cash Value . If the owner of the Policy withdraws or borrows from the Policy s cash value account prior to the Plan Maturity Date, the Company will cease to pay any premiums (as described in Section 8.4 and 8.5) or Premium Bonuses. 
 8.4 Leave of Absence . If a Participant takes an approved leave of absence, the Company will pay the Policy premiums for the duration of the Participant s leave, and coverage will continue at the level that was in effect on the last day the Participant worked. The Participant will remain responsible for income taxes resulting from the Company premium payments. If the Participant does not return to work at the end of the leave, the Company discontinues paying the Policy premiums. 
 8.5 Disability . If the Participant is unable to work because of a disability, as defined by the Plan Administrator, the Company will pay the Policy premiums and coverage will continue at the level of coverage that was in effect on the last day the Participant worked for 
 (f) Up to 12 months if the disability is not work-related or 
 (g) Up to 18 months if the Participant is disabled by illness or injury that is work-related as determined by the Plan Administrator s interpretation of the workers compensation laws. 
 If the Participant remains totally disabled after continuous service ends, the Company will continue Policy premium payments until the Plan Maturity Date provided that the Participant remains totally disabled. The Participant is considered totally disabled if unable to perform the duties of any job whether for the Company or any other employer for which the Participant is reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. The Participant will still be responsible for any taxes due on premiums that were paid by the Company or otherwise that relate to the Participant s coverage. 
 If the Participant is deemed to no longer be totally disabled and does not return to work, the Participant will not be eligible for continued premium payments by the Company. 
 8.6 Termination of Employment Prior to Retirement-Eligibility 
 If a Participant separates from service with all Employers before Retirement-Eligibility, his participation in the Plan will end immediately, but he will be able to keep the cash value of the Policy as of that date. 
 8.7 Downgrade . If a Participant s employment position is downgraded from an Executive position, but he is Retirement-Eligible, then he will continue to participate in the Plan. 
 6 

The coverage amount (and the target paid-up coverage amount used to determine the target cash value at Plan Maturity Date) will be frozen at the coverage amount in effect on the date of the downgrade. 
 If a Participant s employment position is downgraded from an Executive position, and he is not Retirement-Eligible, then his participation in the Plan will end immediately, but he will be able to keep the cash value of the Policy as of that date. 
 8.8 Rehire . If a former Participant was rehired by an Employer in (or re-promoted to) an Executive position on or after January 1, 2018, he is not eligible to enroll or re-enroll in the Plan. If a former Participant was rehired by an Employer in (or re-promoted to) an Executive position before January 1, 2018, he must have been enrolled or re-enrolled in the Plan on December 31, 2019, in order to be a Participant in the Plan as of the Closing Date. 
 9. PLAN AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION 
 The Plan Sponsor reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace, or terminate the Plan at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion, with or without notice, retroactively or prospectively, to the full extent permitted by law. No individual has a vested right to any benefit under the Plan and no provision of the Plan or any communication regarding the Plan shall be interpreted to provide or imply such a right. Such action may be taken by the Plan Sponsor s Board of Directors or an officer authorized by the Board. 
 10. ADMINISTRATION

 If you declined GE Leadership Life coverage, you did not receive the special payments GE makes to fund the coverage (see Section 1.4, HOW IS COVERAGE FUNDED ), and you are not eligible for the GE Life Insurance provided under the GE Life, Disability and Medical Plan. 
 1.2 HOW DO I ENROLL 
 This Plan is closed to new participants as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, in order to have enrolled before the Plan was closed, you must have completed the consent for this Plan and the GE Leadership Life Insurance enrollment application form that was provided through your personal workflow, and your coverage must have become effective before January 1, 2020 (see Section 1.5, WHEN DID COVERAGE BEGIN ). You would have received a link to your personal workflow when you initially became eligible. 
 1.3 HOW DO I NAME A BENEFICIARY 
 You must have named your beneficiary (i.e., the person who receives the benefits from the Plan at your death) on the enrollment application form when you enrolled. If you named more than one beneficiary, you should have indicated on the enrollment application what percentage of the benefits each beneficiary should receive. If percentages aren t specified, the beneficiaries will receive equal amounts. 
 You may have, if you wished, designated one or more contingent beneficiaries. This is the person or persons who receive benefits if none of your primary beneficiaries are alive at the time of your death. 
 If you have no beneficiary at your death, benefits will be paid to your estate or as otherwise required by law. 
 The order in which the death benefit proceeds are paid is as follows 
 Entire death benefit is disbursed to primary beneficiaries per the allocations assigned by you. 
 If a primary beneficiary pre- or co-deceases you, the primary beneficiary s portion generally will be disbursed to the remaining primary beneficiaries per the allocations assigned by you. The exact allocation of these benefits will depend on whether you have designated a per stirpes or per capita inheritance structure. 
 If there are no surviving primary beneficiaries, the entire death benefit is disbursed to the contingent beneficiaries.

If no contingent beneficiary is named, or all of your beneficiaries pre- or co-decease you, the entire death benefit is paid to your estate. 
 1.3.1 MINORS AS A BENEFICIARIES 
 The insurer will not make payment to a minor child because minors do not have the capacity to act on their own behalf with respect to the proceeds of life insurance. A parent, while they may be the natural guardian of the child, is not automatically the guardian of the property of the child. The parent would need to apply for appointment as guardian of the child s property with the courts. In the absence of these guardianship papers, the insurer would generally have to hold onto the proceeds until the minor reaches majority age under state law. 
 1.3.2 UPDATE YOUR BENEFICIARY 
 To update your beneficiary designation, you may call the GE Executive and Leadership Life Service Center at 1-800-799-4777 to request a beneficiary designation form. 
 Any beneficiary designation shall be effective only after the Company receives the properly completed designation form, and only if the form is received while you are still alive. 
 1.3.3 IN CASE OF YOUR DEATH 
 In case of your death, your beneficiary should call the GE Benefits Center at 1-800-252-5259 to be connected with the GE Survivor Support Center. The Survivor Support Center will assist your beneficiary in submitting a benefit claim under the Plan. 
 1.4 HOW IS COVERAGE FUNDED 
 Unless you are a specified employee (as discussed below), the Company funds your GE Leadership Life coverage as follows 
 1. The Company advances the premium to the insurance company. 
 2. The insurance company adds the premium to your policy s cash accumulation fund (see Section 2.4, WHAT IS THE CASH VALUE from which the costs of your insurance coverage are deducted. The balance earns tax-deferred interest at rates set by the insurance company and accumulates over time to build your policy s cash value. 
 3. Premiums increase over time to pay for the higher costs of coverage as you age and as your earnings increase. These increases are effective on April 1 each year. 
 4. Provided you remain eligible for the Plan, the final premium payment will be made in the calendar year in which you turn 65 years old. If you became eligible for coverage at age 55 or older, the Company will make premium payments for 10 calendar years, as long as you remain eligible. 
 If you are a specified employee, within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Code section 409A, and any premium advance is deemed to be deferred compensation paid on account of your separation from service (under Code 409A), the Company will pay any 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20) 
 4 

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

premium advancements, otherwise payable within 6 months following your separation from service, on the date that is 6 months following your separation from service. 
 
 1.5 WHEN DID COVERAGE BEGIN 
 The date your coverage began depended on when you became eligible and when you enrolled. 
 If you became eligible because you just joined the Company, and you enrolled within 90 days of becoming eligible... 
 Then your coverage became effective on your date of hire or the first of the month in which your application was approved, whichever was later. 
 If you became eligible because you were promoted to an eligible position, and you enrolled within 90 days of becoming eligible... 
 Then your coverage became effective on the first day of the second month following your promotion or the first of the month in which the application was approved, whichever was later, provided you were actively at work on the coverage effective date. 
 For example, if you were promoted effective June 15 to a position eligible for the Plan and you enrolled by July 16 within 90 days ), your coverage was effective August 1, provided you were actively at work on August 1. 
 If you were not actively at work when coverage otherwise would have begun... 
 Then your coverage became effective when you returned to work, provided your application was complete and approved by the insurer. In the meantime, if you were covered under GE Life Insurance, your GE Life Insurance coverage continued until your GE Leadership Life Insurance coverage became effective. 
 If you enrolled more than 90 days after becoming eligible, and you provided proof of good health acceptable to the insurance company... 
 Then your coverage went into effect on the first day of the month after the insurance company approved your application and determined that your proof of good health was satisfactory. 
 Your policy should have been delivered shortly after your application was approved. 
 1.6 HOW DOES THE PLAN AFFECT MY TAXES 
 Although GE funds the coverage, you are responsible for the income tax on the premium that GE pays into your policy. GE divides the annual premium by the number of pay periods you have between April 1 and March 31. That prorated amount is added to each paycheck as a special payment. Income taxes are withheld and then the special payment is deducted. 
 However, the cash value of your policy grows on a tax-deferred basis, and death benefits paid to your beneficiary are not subject to income tax. 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20) 
 5 

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

Additionally, if you assign ownership of your policy, consistent with Section 2.3, CAN I ASSIGN OWNERSHIP OF MY POLICY , after your coverage begins and you die within three years of the assignment, the Internal Revenue Service will consider the proceeds from your insurance policy to be part of your estate for tax purposes. 
 1.7 WHEN DOES THE COMPANY STOP FUNDING MY COVERAGE 
 You will continue to participate in the Plan until the earliest of the following dates 
 The date you resign or terminate employment with the Company before you are eligible to Retire, unless you are Totally Disabled (as described in Section 3.4, WHAT IF I AM DISABLED 
 The date you otherwise become ineligible or do not abide by the rules of the Plan 
 The date you withdraw or borrow from the cash value prior to the Company s final premium (see Section 2.4, WHAT IS THE CASH VALUE 
 The date you request that your participation be terminated or 
 The date GE terminates the Plan. 
 In these cases, the Company will not advance any further premium payments to the insurance company. However, your life insurance coverage can continue if you pay the premiums directly to the insurance company. See Section 3.0, EVENTS AFFECTING COVERAGE , for more information. 

RETIREMENT DEFINED 
 
 Retirement or Retire generally means separation from service from the Company after age 60 and after completing 10 years of continuous service.

2.0 HOW THE PLAN WORKS 
 This Section describes your coverage amount, special provisions for cigarette smokers, assigning ownership of your policy, the cash value of your policy, how benefits are paid and what benefits you may be eligible for in the case of terminal illness. 
 2.1 YOUR COVERAGE AMOUNT 
 Your coverage amount is two times your annual pay until you reach age 65, when reductions in coverage begin. See Section 3.1, WHAT HAPPENS TO MY COVERAGE AT AGE 65 for more information. 
 Your pre-age 65 coverage amount will change if your salary or incentive compensation changes. These changes become effective on April 1 each year based on your annual pay as of the last day of the preceding February, provided that you are actively at work on April 1 and you are younger than age 65. If you are not actively at work on April 1, changes will become effective upon your return to active work. If you are age 65 or older, your coverage amount will no longer be adjusted according to your pay. 
 
 WHAT PAY COUNTS 
 
 For the purposes of the Plan, your annual pay is defined as your annual salary rate, plus 100 of your incentive compensation earned in the preceding calendar year. Incentive compensation includes 
 Awards from the Company s Incentive Compensation Plan and 
 Awards from a sales commission or other variable incentive compensation plan. 
 
 If you participate in a sales commission plan with a depressed base salary structure, your annual pay is the greater of 
 Your pre-determined equivalent point (base salary plus targeted commission) or 
 Your base salary plus actual commissions earned. 
 
 If you participate in a variable incentive compensation plan , your annual pay until the first April 1 after your coverage begins will be the greater of 
 Your salary on becoming an Executive Band employee or 
 Your salary plus incentive compensation as a non-Executive Band employee for the preceding calendar year. 

2.2 WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR CIGARETTE SMOKERS OR NICOTINE USERS 
 Coverage for cigarette smokers costs more than coverage for non-smokers. Under the Plan, you are considered to be a cigarette smoker if, on your enrollment date, you have smoked a cigarette or used a nicotine substitute within the past 12 months. 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20) 
 7 

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

The Company will pay the extra cost to provide coverage at two times annual pay during the first 24 months of a cigarette smoker s coverage. After 24 months of coverage under the Plan, the additional payments GE makes to fund the coverage at two times annual pay will end. At that time, cigarette smokers can choose to either 
 Reduce coverage to 1.2 times annual pay or 
 Make the additional payments necessary to maintain coverage at two times annual pay. 
 2.2.1 IF YOU HAVE QUIT SMOKING CIGARETTES AND HAVE NOT USED NICOTINE IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS 
 Former cigarette smokers and nicotine users qualify for the lower non-smoker rates once they have stopped smoking cigarettes and have not used any nicotine substitutes for at least 12 consecutive months. To apply for the lower non-smoker rates, you will need to submit a change application to the GE Executive and Leadership Life Service Center. The insurance company will decide whether to approve your change application. If the application is approved, your coverage at the lower rates goes into effect on the first day of the month after the date of approval. The effect of this change on your insurance rates will be prospective only. 
 If your coverage had previously been reduced to 1.2 times your pay, you may increase it to 2 times your pay by filing a change application and undergoing medical underwriting at the 
 expense of the insurance company. Approval for the increase is at the discretion of the insurer. 
 2.3 CAN I ASSIGN OWNERSHIP OF MY POLICY 
 You may designate an owner other than yourself (i.e., assign ownership) of your GE Leadership Life Insurance policy at any time. 
 If you wish to assign ownership of your policy, call the GE Executive and Leadership Life Service Center at 1-800-799-4777 to request the necessary forms to assign ownership. 
 Please see Section 1.6, HOW DOES THE PLAN AFFECT MY TAXES for how an assignment may impact your estate s taxes upon your death. 
 2.3.1 TRUST OWNERSHIP 
 If you assign ownership of your insurance policy to an irrevocable trust, GE adds one special payment to your paycheck in an amount equal to the total annual premium. If trust assignment occurs after enrollment, the special payment is equal to the remainder of the annual premium. Taxes will be withheld from this payment and GE will not deduct the premium from that paycheck. Instead, you and your trustee will be sent an invoice for the gross amount of the special payment. You may wish to review this with your financial advisor to determine how to pay the invoice. 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20)

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

2.4 WHAT IS THE CASH VALUE 
 Your policy s cash accumulation fund is designed to provide funding to continue a reduced level of insurance coverage after GE s final premium. It builds most quickly in the last 10 years of your participation in the Plan, as the costs of coverage increase based on your age and earnings. 
 To accomplish its intended goal, the accumulation fund needs to build without disruption. However, because GE Leadership Life Insurance coverage is provided through an individual policy, you (or the policy s owner, if you have assigned ownership) may borrow or withdraw from your cash value. Withdrawals during the first 10 years that the policy is in effect are subject to cash surrender charges. 
 If a loan or withdrawal is taken from the policy s cash value, your participation in the Plan ends. Additionally, you will not be eligible for GE Life Insurance provided under the GE Life, Disability and Medical Plan. 
 The cash value helps to provide the death benefit that will be paid to your beneficiary. The cash value is not paid in addition to the death benefit. 
 You are not permitted to make direct contributions to the accumulation fund while the Company is paying premiums on your behalf, except 
 As required to maintain unreduced coverage after age 65 and 
 For cigarette smokers or nicotine users to maintain coverage at two times annual pay. 
 2.4.1 WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CASH VALUE AFTER THE LAST PREMIUM PAYMENT 
 The cash value in your policy after the Company s final premium is designed to cover the cost of your coverage until a specified age. If you have at least 10 years of participation in the Plan as of January 1, 2018, the cash value in your policy after the Company s final premium is designed to cover the cost of your coverage until December 31st of the year in which you turn age 99. If you have less than 10 years of participation in the Plan as of January 1, 2018, the cash value in your policy after the Company s final premium is designed to cover the cost of your coverage until December 31st of the year in which you turn age 84. In addition, the cash value is designed to continue to accumulate while covering the cost of your coverage until the applicable specified age (e.g., age 84 or 99). However, there is no guarantee that the premiums will result in a cash value that is sufficient to provide insurance through the specified age. The performance of the cash value and the longevity of the policy cannot be guaranteed. Actual interest rates and mortality experience after the last premium payment, as well as policy loans or withdrawals you make from the policy, will affect your policy s cash value and the death benefit payable to your beneficiary. You will receive an Annual Statement summarizing the performance and cash value of your policy. If the cash value proves to be insufficient, you may need to make additional premium payments.

2.4.2 SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE AT AGE 100 
 On January 1 of the year in which you reach 100 years of age, the cash value of your policy will be paid out. This payment will be taxable to the extent that there is a gain in the contract. Upon written request, the policy can also be continued until death, at which time the cash value would be paid as an income, tax-free benefit to your designated beneficiary. Ask your tax advisor about any possible tax consequences. 
 2.5 HOW ARE BENEFITS PAID 
 Your beneficiary or beneficiaries will be given the choice between a lump sum or a special interest-bearing account. 
 The interest-bearing account is established to provide your beneficiary with immediate access to the entire amount of your death benefit. The balance of the account will earn interest at a guaranteed minimum interest rate (specified at the time the draft account is created), from the date it is established until the entire amount is withdrawn. Your beneficiary can withdraw all or part of the account balance at any time without charge or penalty, simply by writing drafts which may be subject to a minimum withdrawal 
 amount. However, the account is not a bank account and not a checking, savings, or money market account. 
 Please Note The insurance company may receive investment earnings from operating the account that are greater than the amount of interest that the insurance company pays to your beneficiary on the balance of the account. The performance results of any investments that the insurance company makes with the account do not affect the interest rate the insurance company pays to your beneficiary on the balance of the account. 
 If there are discrepancies between the information in this document and your policy, the terms of the policy apply. Actual coverage in the event of a loss will apply as provided by the terms, conditions, and exclusions of the policy. 
 2.5.1 IN CASE OF YOUR DEATH 
 In case of your death, your beneficiary should call the GE Benefits Center at 1-800-252-5259 to be connected with the GE Survivor Support Center. The Survivor Support Center will assist your beneficiary in submitting a benefit claim under the Plan. 
 2.6 WHAT IF I AM TERMINALLY ILL 
 If you are diagnosed as terminally ill with 12 months or less to live, you may request an advance payment from your insurance policy, known as an accelerated death benefit (i.e., a Living Benefit ). 
 Living Benefits are subject to the law of the state where you were living at the time your GE Leadership Life Insurance policy went into effect. The applicable law will determine the amount available to you. The maximum amount most commonly available for Living Benefits 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20) 
 10 

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

is the greater of 250,000 or 10 of the coverage amount. However, in no case will the Living Benefit exceed the coverage amount minus 25,000. 
 For more information on the laws that apply to the GE Leadership Life policy issued to you, or if you need to access this benefit, contact the GE Executive and Leadership Life Service Center at 1-800-799-4777 or email at leaderlife aon.com . 
 Please Note To claim a Living Benefit, you will need to provide a written diagnosis from your doctor satisfactory to the insurance company. You will also be subject to any additional limitations and requirements established by the insurance company. Any Living Benefit payment will be deducted from the life insurance benefit before the remainder is paid to your beneficiary after your death.

3.0 EVENTS AFFECTING COVERAGE 
 Special provisions apply to your GE Leadership Life coverage when certain events occur. This Section provides details about the various changes that can occur. 
 3.1 WHAT HAPPENS TO MY COVERAGE AT AGE 65 
 If you continue to be eligible to participate in the Plan at age 65, in most cases, GE pays the final premium in the year you turn 65 (regardless of whether you are still working). Your insurance coverage begins to reduce when you reach age 65. All reductions go into effect on the January 1 after your 65th birthday. 
 
 On the January 1 after you reach... 
 
 Your coverage is reduced... 
 Age 65 
 To 75 of your pre-age 65 coverage 
 Age 66 
 To 50 of your pre-age 65 coverage 
 Age 67 
 To 33 1 3 of your pre-age 65 coverage, which continues for as long as you continue your policy 
 
 If your birthday is January 1, applicable reductions go into effect on your 65th, 66th and 67th birthdays. 
 Decreases are rounded to the nearest 100 and subtracted from the face amount. The new face amount is not rounded. 
 
 EXAMPLES HOW COVERAGE REDUCES AT 65 
 
 Non-smokers (and smokers who pay extra premiums) 
 Brian has GE Leadership Life Insurance coverage of 300,000, or 2 times his annual pay of 
 150,000, in effect at age 65. On the January 1 after his 65th birthday, his coverage reduces to 75 of his pre-age 65 coverage, or 225,000. On the January 1 after his 66th birthday, his coverage reduces by an additional 25 , to 50 of his pre-age 65 coverage, or 150,000. On the January 1 after he reaches age 67, his coverage reduces for the final time to 331 3 of his pre-age 65 coverage to 100,000 which stays in effect as long as the policy continues. 
 
 Smokers who elect reduced coverage 
 Joan, who also earns 150,000, has GE Leadership Life Insurance coverage of 180,000 in effect at age 65 less than 2 times her annual pay because she is a smoker who chose a reduced level of coverage (1.2 times her annual pay) rather than pay additional premiums. On the January 1 after her 65th birthday, her coverage reduces to 75 , or 135,000 and on the January 1 after her 66th birthday, by an additional 25 , to 50 of her pre-age 65 coverage, or 90,000. On the January 1 after she reaches age 67, her coverage reduces for the final time, by an additional 16.67 , to 331 3 of her pre-age 65 coverage, or 60,000 which stays in effect as long as the policy continues. 
 
 COVERAGE DECISIONS AT AGE 65 
 The GE Executive and Leadership Life Service Center will notify you approximately two months before you ll need to make a decision about your coverage election at age 65.

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

3.2 WHAT ARE MY OTHER COVERAGE OPTIONS AT AGE 65 
 Your cash value is intended to fund reduced coverage after you reach age 65. However, if you prefer, you may elect one of three other options when you reach age 65 
 Unreduced coverage you may choose to continue any amount of coverage up to and including the full, pre-age 65 coverage by paying additional premiums over 5 or 10 years 
 Partial withdrawal you may withdraw a portion of your cash value. The coverage amount will also be reduced by the same amount of the withdrawal or 
 Full withdrawal termination you may withdraw your entire cash value which will cancel your policy. You ll have no further insurance coverage from GE Leadership Life Insurance. 
 You may decide to take one of the above actions on your policy at any time after you reach age 65. 
 If you become eligible for the Plan after you reach age 55, you may elect unreduced coverage when you reach age 65. However, you may not borrow or withdraw from your cash value until you complete 10 years of participation in the Plan if you do, your participation in the Plan will end and GE will discontinue its premium payments. 
 3.3 WHAT IF I AM LAID OFF OR ENTITLED TO SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
 The Company will continue its premium payments for up to 12 months and your coverage will continue at the level that was in effect on the last day you worked, if you 
 Are either 
 Unable to work because of layoff or other permanent job-loss event, or 
 Entitled to receive benefits under the GE Executive Severance Plan, and 
 Execute (and do not revoke) a release satisfactory to the Company. 
 At the end of this period of continued coverage (not to exceed 12 months), the Company discontinues paying the policy premiums. Your options in this event are described in Section 3.6, WHAT IF I LEAVE THE COMPANY After the end of this period of continued coverage (not to exceed 12 months), you will receive more detailed information about these options. 
 3.4 WHAT IF I AM DISABLED 
 If you are unable to work because of a disability, as defined under the GE Long-Term Disability Income Plan, the Company will continue its premium payments and coverage will continue at the level of coverage that was in effect on the last day you worked for 
 Up to 12 months if your disability is not work-related or 
 Up to 18 months if you are disabled by an illness or injury that is work-related as determined by Workers Compensation. 
 If you remain Totally Disabled after your continuous service ends, the Company will continue its premium payments (until age 65 or the 10th policy year, whichever is later) and your coverage will continue at your existing level of GE Leadership Life Insurance coverage until 

GE LEADERSHIP LIFE INSURANCE (LELI-20) 
 14 

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

you reach age 65, provided that you remain Totally Disabled. You are considered Totally Disabled if you are unable to perform the duties of any job whether for the Company or any other employer for which you are reasonably suited by education, training, or experience. You will still be responsible for any taxes due on premiums that were paid by the Company or otherwise related to your coverage. 
 If you are deemed to no longer be Totally Disabled, and you do not return to work, you will not be eligible for continued premium payments by the Company. Your options in this event are described in Section 3.6, WHAT IF I LEAVE THE COMPANY 
 3.5 WHAT IF I TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
 If you take an approved leave of absence, the Company will pay its premiums into your policy for the duration of your leave, and coverage will continue at the level that was in effect on the last day you worked. You will remain responsible for income taxes resulting from the Company premium payments. If you do not return to work at the end of your leave, the Company will discontinue paying the policy premiums. Your options in this event are described in Section 3.6, WHAT IF I LEAVE THE COMPANY 
 3.6 WHAT IF I LEAVE THE COMPANY 
 GE stops paying premiums into your policy as of 
 The date your employment with the Company ends for any reason other than Total Disability or Retirement or 
 The first date on which 
 The period of continued coverage (not to exceed 12 months) ends following a layoff or separation from service that entitles you to benefits under the GE Executive Severance Plan 
 Your approved leave of absence ends or 
 You are no longer considered Totally Disabled. 
 Because your policy is individually owned, your coverage is portable. That means you may 
 Continue coverage by paying the necessary premiums directly to the insurance company 
 Continue coverage for a limited time by using your accumulated cash value or 
 Withdraw the cash value and cancel the policy. If you do this, you ll have no remaining insurance coverage from GE Leadership Life Insurance. Withdrawals during the first 10 years that the policy is in effect are subject to cash surrender charges. 
 If you leave the Company, you are responsible for communicating directly with the insurance company regarding your policy.

Go to OneHR.ge.com for benefits information, forms, transactions and more. 

3.6.1 PAYMENT OF TAXES 
 The Company pays the premiums in advance. After your employment ends and regardless of whether you keep the policy or cancel it, you will still be responsible for the taxes due on any premiums that were paid in advance by GE. Income taxes that have not been withheld prior to your last paycheck are still your responsibility. You will be sent an invoice for any income tax due. 
 3.6.2 IF YOU WERE REHIRED 
 If you leave the Company and you 
 Were later rehired as an Executive, Senior Executive or Officer Band Company Employee on or after January 1, 2018 or 
 Were later rehired as an Executive, Senior Executive or Officer Band Company Employee before January 1, 2018, but you failed to enroll or be re-enrolled on December 31, 2019, 
 You are not eligible to enroll (or re-enroll) in the Plan. 
 If you left the Company and were rehired into an eligible leadership position before January 1, 2018, you needed to re-enroll as if you were a new employee by December 31, 
 2019. The Company makes premium payments toward a new policy on your behalf foras long as you remain eligible. However, you were not eligible for a new policy if the Company continued to fund your existing policy. The Company will only fund one policy. 
 3.7 WHAT IF I CHANGE TO AN INELIGIBLE POSITION 
 If you are participating in the Plan because you are an Executive, Senior Executive or Officer Band Company Employee, and you then transfer to or are re-classified as a non-eligible position, GE will continue your participation in GE Leadership Life Insurance without interruption. (Note, however, that if you transfer to a GE business or affiliate that does not participate in the Plan, your coverage generally will end.

 Exhibit 10(d) 
 GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan 
 Effective as of January 1, 2023 

 Introduction 
 The GE Supplementary Pension Plan consists of two parts as set forth herein. Part I describes Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefits, and Part II describes Executive Retirement Installment Benefits. 
 Effective January 1, 2023 in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising its aviation, healthcare, and energy businesses, respectively, the Plan is renamed the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan, and benefits and liabilities under this Plan attributable to certain individuals are transferred to two newly established plans, as described in Appendix A. Each such plan is a continuation of this Plan with respect to the individuals transferred to it. After December 31, 2022, no individual whose benefit is transferred to another plan (nor any of their beneficiaries) shall accrue additional benefits or service, or have any rights, under, or with respect to, this Plan (even if such individual is subsequently employed by, or has service with, the Company or its Affiliates), unless the individual s benefit is transferred back to the Plan in accordance with Appendix A. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective January 1, 2011, Part I of the Plan is closed. Accordingly, an Employee shall be eligible for a Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefit only if he participated in this Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (and shall actually receive such benefit only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). For purposes of determining whether an Employee participated in the Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (a) any period of service described in Section XV(b) shall be disregarded and (b) an Employee shall be deemed to have met such requirement if he waived participation in the GE Pension Plan, but was otherwise eligible to participate in this Plan and is not an Excluded Employee or Ineligible Employee under the GE Pension Plan. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective December 31, 2020, benefits under Part I of the Plan are frozen, and no Employee shall accrue benefits under Part I of the Plan after such date. Prior to January 1, 2021, Part I and Part II of the Plan provided mutually exclusive benefits, and eligible Employees earned their entire benefits under the Plan either under Part I or Part II, but not both. However, Employees who are eligible for and participating under Part I of the Plan on December 31, 2020, shall commence participation under Part II of the Plan on January 1, 2021. An Employee will be considered to be eligible for and participating under Part I of the Plan and will be eligible to participate under Part II of the Plan only if, on December 31, 2020, the Employee (A) was assigned to the GE executive or higher career band (B) was employed by the Company and (C) was enrolled in the GE Pension Plan (i.e., had not waived or suspended participation in the GE Pension Plan). 
 Further notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Part II of the Plan is closed effective January 1, 2021. Accordingly, an Employee shall be eligible for an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit only if he was eligible for and participating under Part I or Part II of the Plan on December 31, 2020 (and shall actually receive such benefit only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). For the avoidance of doubt, an Employee who was previously eligible for Part II of the Plan will not be eligible to accrue future Benefit Service under Part II of the Plan if, on December 31, 2020, the Employee (A) was not assigned to the GE executive or higher career band or (B) was not employed by the Company. 

The Pension Board may adopt such rules as it deems necessary to determine which Part of the Plan applies to which Employees. 
 As described in Section XXIII, certain provisions of Part I apply to Part II, but no provisions of Part II apply to Part I (except that the service disregard rule in Section XV(b) shall apply in determining which Part of the Plan applies to which Employees).

Part I Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefits (closed to new participants and frozen) 
 As more fully described in the Introduction (and subject to the rules thereof), this Part I of the Plan is closed effective January 1, 2011, and an Employee shall be eligible to participate under this Part I (and not Part II) only if he participated in the Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (and shall actually receive a benefit under this Part only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). In addition, effective December 31, 2020, benefits under Part I of the Plan are frozen, and no Employee shall accrue benefits under Part I of the Plan on and after such date. Employees who were eligible for and participating under this Part I of the Plan on December 31, 2020, shall commence participation under Part II of the Plan on January 1, 2021. 
 Section I. Eligible Employees

 (c) no individual shall accrue a benefit under this Part I in respect of any period after December 31, 2020. 
 An employee of any other company who participates in the GE Pension Plan, though the employing company does not participate in the GE Pension Plan, shall be eligible for benefits under this Plan, provided that such employee meets the job position requirement specified above, and the employee s participation in the Supplementary Pension Plan is accepted by the Pension Board. 
 An Employee who was eligible to participate in this Plan by virtue of his assigned position level or position of equivalent responsibility throughout any consecutive three years of the fifteen year period ending on either the last day of the month preceding his termination of Service date for retirement or December 31, 2020, and who meets the other requirements specified in this Section shall be eligible for the benefits provided herein even though he does not meet the eligibility requirements on the date his Service terminates. 
 The Chief Executive Officer of General Electric Company, or his delegate, may approve the continued participation in the Plan of an individual who is localized outside the

United States as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate and who otherwise meets all of the eligibility conditions set forth herein during such localization. The designated individual s service and pay while localized, with appropriate offsets for local country benefits, shall be counted in calculating his Supplementary Pension. Such calculation and the individual s entitlement to any benefits herein shall be determined consistent with the principles of the Plan as they apply to participants who are not localized, provided that the Chief Executive Officer, or his delegate, may direct such other treatment, if any, as he deems appropriate. 
 An Employee who was eligible to participate under this Part I of the Plan and who, before becoming entitled to a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan, left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates shall not again become eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan during any period of reemployment with the Company that commences on or after January 1, 2021.

An Employee s Pension Benefit Service that is reinstated after December 31, 2020, for purposes of the GE Pension Plan pursuant to Section XXI.3.a (Eligibility for Reinstatement) of such plan shall be reinstated for purposes of this Plan only if such Employee has been continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until the date of such reinstatement. 
 (n) Pension Qualification Service - Pension Qualification Service shall have the same meaning herein as in the GE Pension Plan except that for periods before January 1, 1976 the term Credited Service used in determining such Pension Qualification Service shall mean only Service for which an Employee is credited with a past service annuity or a future service annuity under the GE Pension Plan (plus his first year of Service where such year is recognized as additional Credited Service under that Plan), except as the Pension Board may otherwise provide by rules and regulations issued with respect to this Plan. Pension Qualification Service that is credited to an Employee under the GE Pension Plan after 
 8 

December 31, 2020, including service with an Affiliate that is credited as Pension Qualification Service under Section XVI.2 (Transfer to and from Non-Participating Companies) of the GE Pension Plan, will continue to be credited as Pension Qualification Service under this Plan provided, however, that an Employee who leaves the Service of the Company and all Affiliates at any time and is subsequently rehired by the Company or an Affiliate on or after January 1, 2021 
 (1) will not have any Pension Qualification Service attributable to any earlier period of employment with the Company or an Affiliate reinstated, regardless of whether such Pension Qualification Service is reinstated under Section XXI.3.a (Eligibility for Reinstatement) or any other provision of the GE Pension Plan 
 (2) will not be credited with any Pension Qualification Service attributable to service with an Affiliate that does not participate in this Plan, regardless of whether such service is credited as Pension Qualification Service under Section XVI.2 (Transfer to and from Non-Participating Companies) or any other provision of the GE Pension Plan and 
 (3) will not be credited with Pension Qualification Service for purposes of this Plan with respect to the Employee s period of reemployment.

 (p) Separation from Service - Separation from Service means an Employee s termination of employment with the Company and all Affiliates (defined for purposes of this Plan as any company or business entity in which General Electric Company has a 50 or more interest whether or not a participating employer in the Plan) provided that, Separation from Service for purposes of the Plan shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Section 409A and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. For purposes of clarity, any references in this Plan to Service in the context of determining the time or form of benefits will not extend beyond an Employee s Separation from Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the spinoffs of GE HealthCare and GE Energy from the Company shall not be treated as a Separation from Service. 
 (q) Service of the Company or an Affiliate - An Employee is in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate if the Employee is employed by the Company or an Affiliate or has terminated employment with the Company and all Affiliates but has not had his protected service (also referred to as continuous service terminated under established Company procedures.

 All other terms used in this Plan which are defined in the GE Pension Plan shall have the same meanings herein as therein, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Plan. 
 Section III. Amount of Supplementary Pension at or After Normal Retirement 
 (a) The annual Supplementary Pension payable to an eligible Employee who retires on or after his normal retirement date within the meaning of the GE Pension Plan shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the Employee s Annual Retirement Income, over the sum of 
 (1) the Employee s Annual Pension Payable under the GE Pension Plan 
 (2) of the Employee s Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit 
 (3) the Employee s annual excess benefit, if any, payable under the GE Excess Benefit Plan (as amended and renamed from time to time) and 
 (4) The Employee s annual benefit, if any, payable under the GE Executive Special Early Retirement Option and Plant Closing Retirement Option Plan (as amended and renamed from time to time). 
 Such Supplementary Pension shall be subject to the limitations specified in Section IX. An eligible Employee who did not retire hereunder before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement on or after his normal retirement date within the meaning of the GE Pension Plan in order to receive a Supplementary Pension computed under this Section III(a). 
 (b) The Supplementary Pension of an Employee who continues in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate after his normal retirement date shall not commence before his actual retirement date following Separation from Service, regardless of whether such Employee has attained age 70- and commenced receiving his pension under the GE Pension Plan. 
 (c) Consistent with established Company procedures, if an eligible Employee commences his Supplementary Pension at the time set forth in Section X(a) but remains in protected service for other purposes, his initial 
 10 

Supplementary Pension Plan benefit shall be based on his service credits earned up to the commencement date of his Supplementary Pension Plan benefit. Following the eligible Employee s break in protected service, the dollar amount (but not the time or form of distribution) of the eligible Employee s Supplementary Pension Plan benefit shall be adjusted consistent with such procedures to take into account any additional service credits the eligible Employee may have earned under the GE Pension Plan and any related offsets. For periods on and after January 1, 2021, service credits described in this Section III(c) shall not include Pension Benefit Service, which shall not be credited under Part I of this Plan to any Employee after December 31, 2020. 
 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, an individual who is not eligible for a benefit under the GE Pension Plan shall not be eligible for a Supplementary Pension, and benefits under this Plan shall be determined consistently with the intent not to duplicate benefits that are payable from another plan. 
 Section IV. Amount of Supplementary Pension at Optional or Disability Retirement 
 (a) The annual Supplementary Pension payable to an eligible Employee who, following attainment of age 60, retires hereunder on an optional retirement date within the meaning of Section V.1. of the GE Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section III(a) (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) but taking into account only Pension Benefit Service and Average Annual Compensation to the earlier of the actual date of optional retirement or December 31, 2020. Such Supplementary Pension shall be subject to the limitations specified in Section IX. In the event such Employee is a New Plan Participant on the date of his termination of Service, such Supplementary Pension, as so limited, shall be reduced to reflect commencement before his normal retirement date by applying the methodology provided under Section V.3. of the GE Pension Plan. Consistent with the foregoing, such reduction shall equal 5 12 for each month from the first month following such Employee s Separation from Service to his normal retirement date. Said reduction shall not be imposed, however, in the event such Employee s Separation from Service occurs on or after the Employee s (1) attainment of at least age 62 and (2) completion of at least 25 years of Pension Qualification Service. An eligible Employee who did not retire hereunder before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement on an optional retirement date within the meaning of Section V.1 of the GE Pension Plan in order to receive a Supplementary Pension computed under this Section IV(a). 
 (b) The annual Supplementary Pension payable to an eligible Employee who retires on a Disability Pension under Section VII of the GE Pension Plan and who qualifies as disabled by receiving income replacement benefits under a Company plan for a period of not less than three months and otherwise meeting the requirements under Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(4) and regulations and other guidance issued 
 11 

thereunder shall first be computed in the manner provided by Section III(a) (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) taking into account only Pension Benefit Service and Average Annual Compensation to the earlier of the actual date of disability retirement or December 31, 2020. Such Supplementary Pension shall be subject to the limitations specified in Section IX. In the event the Employee is a New Plan Participant, such Supplementary Pension, as so limited, shall be reduced by 25 consistent with the methodology provided under Section VII.3. of the GE Pension Plan to reflect commencement before the Employee s earliest optional retirement age. An eligible Employee who did not retire hereunder before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement on a Disability Pension under Section VII of the GE Pension Plan in order to receive a Supplementary Pension computed under this Section IV(b). 
 If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the GE Pension Plan is discontinued thereunder as a result of the cessation of the Employee s disability prior to the attainment of age 60, the Supplementary Pension provided under this Section IV(b) shall be forfeited and the Employee shall only be eligible for a Supplementary Pension to the extent he separately qualifies under another provision set forth herein. 
 Section V. Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees 
 (a) A former Employee whose Service with the Company is terminated on or after June 27, 1988, before attainment of age 60 and after completion of 25 or more years of Pension Qualification Service who does not withdraw his contributions from the GE Pension Plan before retirement and who meets one of the following conditions shall be eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Plan commencing at the time set forth in Section X.(a). An eligible Employee who did not meet such requirements before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until meeting one of the following conditions to be eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Plan. 
 (1) The Employee s Service is terminated because of a Plant Closing. 
 (2) The Employee s Service is terminated for transfer to a Successor Employer. The conditions of this paragraph (2) shall not be satisfied, however, if the transferred Employee retires under the GE Pension Plan before July 1, 2000 and prior to the later of (A) his termination of service with the Successor Employer and (B the first of the month following attainment of age 60. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section V(a) shall not apply if all Plan liabilities with respect to the Employee are transferred to a spin-off plan maintained by such Successor Employer or an affiliate thereof. 
 (3) The Employee s Service terminated after one year on layoff with protected service. 
 12 

Effective July 1, 1994 and regardless of whether the Employee terminated Service on, before or after such date, for purposes of this Section V(a) and any other provision of this Plan, a former Employee will be deemed to have withdrawn his contributions from the GE Pension Plan at such time the payment of benefits attributable to such contributions commences, regardless of whether such contributions are paid in the form of a lump sum or an annuity. 
 (b) The Supplementary Pension, if any, for Employees who meet the conditions in Section V(a) shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section IV(a) (other than the requirement to remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement), including the imposition of the reduction described therein to reflect a commencement date occurring before normal retirement date in the case of Employees who are New Plan Participants on the date of their termination of Service. For purposes of making this calculation, the Employee s (1) Pension Benefit Service to the earlier of the Service termination date or December 31, 2020, shall be considered (2) Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months before the earlier of such Service termination date or December 31, 2020 and (3) Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee s retirement date was the earlier of such Service termination date or December 31, 2020. 
 (c) No Supplementary Pension shall be payable to any former Employee who elects to accelerate the commencement of his pension under the GE Pension Plan under Section XI.4.b(iii) therein, nor shall any death or survivor benefits be payable hereunder with respect to such an Employee. 
 (d) In the event a former Employee whose Service with the Company was terminated under circumstances entitling him to a benefit pursuant to this Section V is reemployed, such Employee will retain a non-forfeitable interest in a benefit equal to the amount payable under this provision attributable to such Employee s first period of service (with the calculation of any offsets determined in accordance with established administrative practices and based upon assumptions in effect as of such Employee s first termination date). The same principle shall apply in determining the non-forfeitable interest hereunder of similarly-situated Employees with less than 25 years of Pension Qualification Service who, as a result of Company or Pension Board action, attained a non-forfeitable interest in their Supplementary Pension upon transfer to a successor employer and are subsequently re-employed by the Company. 
 (e) In the event General Electric Company announces its intention to dispose of a predominant share of the businesses of General Electric Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries, Employees of any such GE Capital operations to be disposed of or discontinued in connection with such action will be eligible for Special Benefit Protection treatment as described in this Section V by meeting the conditions for such treatment set forth in this Section V, except that they will only be required to have completed at least 10 years (instead of 25 years) of Pension Qualification Service as of 
 13 

their termination because of a Plant Closing, transfer to Successor Employer or layoff after one year on protected service. This paragraph (e) shall not apply to an Employee who terminates Service for any other reason, or is assigned to (or offered employment with) any continuing operation of the Company or any Affiliate (including a continuing GE Capital operation). This paragraph (e) also shall not apply unless the Employee executes a Release on such terms and in such manner as the Company may require in its absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pension Board may in its absolute discretion prescribe such additional conditions and other rules as it deems necessary or advisable in applying this paragraph (e), including the designation of groups of employees who shall and shall not be eligible for this Special Benefit Protection treatment. 
 This paragraph (e) is intended to serve as a special retention arrangement in connection with General Electric Company s announcement to dispose of a predominant share of the businesses of General Electric Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries. This paragraph (e) shall not apply to any employee who terminates service prior to such an announcement or is on protected service at the time of such announcement, except as otherwise provided by the Pension Board in its absolute discretion. 
 (f) Employees of the General Electric Company GE corporate division who are laid off as a result of the November 9, 2021 announcement to restructure into three industry leading public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy (the Transition will be eligible for Special Benefit Protection treatment described in this Section V by meeting the conditions for such treatment set forth in this Section V, except that the service eligibility requirement will be met if they have completed at least 10 years (instead of 25 years) of Pension Qualification Service as of their Separation from Service, or would have completed at least 10 years of Pension Qualification Service by December 31, 2023. This paragraph (f) shall not apply to an Employee who (i) is laid off from any other business or division of GE, (ii) is laid off from the corporate division of GE for any other reason, (iii) is assigned to (or offered employment with) any continuing operation of the Company or any Affiliate or their successor entities or (iv) as of March 1, 2022, is an executive officer and Senior Vice President or above of GE. This paragraph (f) also shall not apply unless the Employee executes a Release on such terms and in such manner as the Company may require in its absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pension Board may in its absolute discretion prescribe such additional conditions and other rules as it deems necessary or advisable in applying this paragraph (f), including the designation of groups of employees who shall and shall not be eligible for this Special Benefit Protection treatment. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing and any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the employment of an Employee who vests in a Supplementary Pension pursuant to this paragraph (f) is terminated for Cause or if the Pension Board determines in its sole discretion that such Employee has engaged in conduct that (i) constitutes a breach of the Release, (ii) results 
 14 

in (or has the potential to cause) material harm financially, reputationally, or otherwise to the Company or an Affiliate or their successor entities or (iii) occurred prior to the Employee s Separation from Service and would give rise to a termination for Cause (regardless of whether such conduct is discovered before, during or after the Employee s Separation from Service), the Employee shall forfeit the Employee s right to any unpaid Supplementary Pension under this Plan and may be required to repay any Supplementary Pension amounts previously paid under the Plan to the extent recovery is permitted by law. The remedy under this subsection (f) is not exclusive and shall not limit any right of the Company or any Affiliate under applicable law, including (but not limited to) a remedy under (i) Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange or national securities association on which shares of the Company may be traded, and or (iii) any Company policy adopted with respect to compensation recoupment. 
 Section VI. Survivor Benefits 
 If a survivor benefit applies with respect to an Employee s Supplementary Pension pursuant to Section X below, his Supplementary Pension shall be reduced in the same manner as the pension payable under the GE Pension Plan is reduced under such circumstances in accordance with the principles of Section IX of the GE Pension Plan. 
 Section VII. Payments Upon Death 
 If an eligible Employee dies in active Service or following retirement on a Supplementary Pension, or if a former Employee entitled to a Supplementary Pension pursuant to Section V dies prior to such retirement, (1) the principles of Section X of the GE Pension Plan (disregarding any references therein to Employee contributions) shall apply to determine whether a death benefit is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under this Supplementary Pension Plan, and (2) any such death benefit shall be computed and paid in accordance with such principles, based on the Supplementary Pension payable under this Plan provided, however, that 
 (a) with respect to any pre-retirement death benefit attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits where a Surviving Spouse otherwise would have a choice to receive such benefit as an annuity in accordance with the principles of Section X.9 of the GE Pension Plan (Preretirement Spouse Benefit) or as a lump sum in accordance with the principles of either Section X.2 (Five Year Certain (Death After Optional Retirement Age)) or Section X.3 (Five Year Certain (Death After 15 Years Pension Qualification Service)) of the GE Pension Plan, the lump sum value of such benefit under each applicable paragraph shall be determined (in the case of the Preretirement Spouse Benefit, based on the actuarial assumptions described in paragraph 3 of Section XV of the GE Pension Plan), and then the Surviving Spouse shall receive whichever resulting lump sum value is larger as of the first day of the month following the Employee s death. For purposes of clarity, such Surviving Spouse shall not be eligible to receive 
 15 

an annuity in the form of the Preretirement Spouse Benefit under the principles of Section X.9 of the GE Pension Plan 
 (b) with respect to any post-retirement death benefit attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits under the principles of Section X.11 of the GE Pension Plan (Five Year Certain (No Survivor Benefit)), the calculation of the lump sum shall be determined without making any discount to present value. Consistent with the foregoing, such lump sum shall equal the excess of (1) 5 times the Employee s Supplementary Pension payable as a single life annuity over (2) the total payments under this Plan to the Employee and 
 (c) no pre-retirement death benefit shall be payable under this Section VII to an Employee who dies in active Service while reemployed after the Employee left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates, if the Employee left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates (1) on or after January 1, 2021, and (2) before becoming entitled to a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan. 
 Section VIII. Employees Retired Before July 1, 1973

 (4) the Employee s annual excess benefit, if any, payable under the GE Excess Benefit Plan (as amended and renamed from time to time) and 
 (5) The Employee s annual benefit, if any, payable under the GE Executive Special Early Retirement Option and Plant Closing Retirement Option Plan (as amended and renamed from time to time) 
 exceeds 60 of his Average Annual Compensation (with such Supplementary Pension and the amounts set forth in (2), (4) and (5) above determined before imposition of any applicable reduction factor or adjustment for optional or disability retirement, a survivor benefit or otherwise), such Supplementary Pension (as so determined) shall be reduced by the amount of the excess. Any further reductions or 
 16 

adjustments prescribed herein, including those applicable to Employees who are New Plan Participants on the date of their termination of Service, shall be applied against such reduced Supplementary Pension. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan (other than Section XIV(e)) to the contrary, the amount of Supplementary Pension and any death or survivor benefit payable to or on behalf of any Employee who is or was an Officer shall be determined in accordance with such general rules and regulations as may be adopted by a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors for such purpose, subject to the limitation that any such Supplementary Pension or death benefit may not exceed the amount which would be payable hereunder in the absence of such rules and regulations. 
 Section X. Payment of Supplementary Pension Benefits 
 (a) Time and Form of Payment. This Section governs the time and form of payment of the Supplementary Pension on and after the retirement of an eligible Employee. See Section VII above for certain additional rules regarding Payments on Death. 
 (1) General Provisions. Supplementary Pensions shall be payable in monthly installments, each equal to 1 12th of the annual amount determined under the applicable Section. In addition, the provisions of the GE Pension Plan with respect to the following shall apply to amounts payable under this Plan 
 (A) The date of the last payment of any Supplementary Pension. 
 (B) Treatment of amounts payable to a missing person. 
 In no event shall the accelerated payment option of Section XI.4.b(iii) of the GE Pension Plan apply with respect to this Plan. 
 (2) Grandfathered Plan Benefits. Payment of Supplementary Pensions provided for herein which are attributable to Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be in the same form and commence as of the same date as distribution is made pursuant to the Participant s election under the GE Pension Plan (subject to the special rule in Section III(b) of this Plan for Employees over age 70- ). 
 (3) Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 (A) Time of Payment . 
 (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) below (relating to disability pensions), all payments of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month after the Employee s Separation 
 17 

from Service or the Employee s attainment of age 60, if later provided, however, that if an Employee is a Specified Employee, payment of any Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit shall not be made within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. In the event distribution to a Specified Employee is so delayed, payment of the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit shall begin on the first day of the seventh month following Separation from Service and the first such payment shall be increased to reflect the missed payments (with interest accumulated in accordance with Pension Board procedures). 
 (ii) Payment of Supplementary Pensions attributable to disability as provided for in Section IV(b) shall commence on the first day of the month after the Employee s Separation from Service provided, however, that the Employee shall forfeit any payments attributable to months prior to the first date on which a Disability Pension is actually paid under Section VII of the GE Pension Plan. For this purpose, any retroactive payments that may be made under the GE Pension Plan shall be disregarded and no corresponding retroactive payments shall be made hereunder. 
 (B) Form of Payment. Unless an Employee makes an effective election pursuant to paragraph (B)(i) below, such benefits shall be paid as a 50 Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.1 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto (for Employees who are married at the time their Supplementary Pension begins) or as a single life annuity in accordance with the principles of Section XV, X.11 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto (for Employees who are not married at the time their Supplementary Pension begins) provided, however, that 
 (i) As an alternative to the normal distribution forms set forth in this paragraph (B), a married Employee may elect to receive all payments of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits as a single life annuity as described above, a 100 Alternative Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.3 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto, or a 75 Alternative Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.10 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto. In the case of a disability pension payable under Section IV(b) above, however, the 100 
 18 

Alternative Survivor Benefit shall not be available. An election under this paragraph may not be made more than 60 days following the date as of which payment is otherwise to commence in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) above. For purposes of clarity, if an Employee is a Specified Employee for whom the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit is delayed in accordance with paragraph (3)(A)(i) above, an election under this paragraph may be made anytime within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. If such Specified Employee dies during the six-month delay, the Specified Employee will be treated as if he retired before death, without regard to such delay, and commenced receiving his benefit either in accordance with his actual election under this paragraph as to the form of distribution, or in accordance the rules in paragraph (3)(B) above if no such election was made before death. 
 (ii) Regardless of the initial form of payment for Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, the revocation feature provided in Section IX.8 of the GE Pension Plan shall not apply to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 (b) Impact of Reemployment. If an Employee is reemployed by the Company or an Affiliate, the following provisions shall apply with respect to the determination of the Employee s Supplementary Pension 
 (1) Grandfathered Plan Benefits . If the Employee s pension under the GE Pension Plan is suspended or may not commence for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions of that plan, the Employee s Supplementary Pension attributable to Grandfathered Plan Benefits that would otherwise be payable during such re-employment shall be forfeited under this Plan. For this purpose, any addition to the Employee s Supplementary Pension which he may earn hereunder following such re-employment shall not cause such Grandfathered Plan Benefits to be reclassified as Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. Upon the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service, the Employee s original distribution election, if any, with respect to such original Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be disregarded and such original Grandfathered Plan Benefit (adjusted for any additional accrual or reduction) will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan in effect at the time of such subsequent Separation from Service applicable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. If such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such original Grandfathered Plan Benefits (as so adjusted) will be determined in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions then applicable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to Grandfathered Specified Employees. 
 19 

(2) Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits . If the Employee is rehired after having commenced receiving his Supplementary Pension, and in accordance with the terms of the GE Pension Plan, the Employee would have had his pension therefrom suspended upon such re-employment, the Employee shall forfeit any benefits from this Plan attributable to his Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit that would otherwise be payable during such re-employment. Upon the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service 
 (A) If the Employee s Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit is the same or has decreased, then 
 (i) the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit earned during the first period of employment will resume immediately in the same form of distribution and with the same conversion and reduction factors that applied to the original distribution of such benefit 
 (ii) if such original distribution form was a 50 Survivor Benefit, 75 Alternative Survivor Benefit or 100 Alternative Survivor Benefit, any survivor benefits will be payable only if the Surviving Spouse was married to the Participant at the time of his original retirement and 
 (iii) such benefit will be reduced, as necessary, if the Employee s Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit decreases as a result of his second period of employment. 
 If such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, then any death or survivor benefits attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits will be based on such original form of distribution with payment commencing on the first of the month following death. Survivor benefits will be payable only if the Surviving Spouse was married to the Employee at the time of his original retirement and is otherwise eligible to receive payments hereunder. 
 (B) If the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit payable upon such subsequent Separation from Service has increased as a result of the Employee s second period of employment, then the above provisions set forth in paragraph (2)(A) will govern the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit earned during the first period of employment (as applicable), and the following will apply to any additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit 
 (i) the additional benefit amount shall be distributed separately commencing on the first of the month following such subsequent Separation from Service based upon the Employee s age, marital status and 
 20 

the otherwise applicable Plan terms at that time and any new distribution election made by the Employee in accordance with Section X(a)(3) above, and 
 (ii) if such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit will be determined separately in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions. 
 (3) If an Employee is rehired under circumstances where he previously accrued a non-forfeitable interest in his Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit but had not commenced receiving such benefit prior to his reemployment, the following shall apply 
 (A) Such Employee shall forfeit the dollar amount of any Plan Benefits that would otherwise be paid while re-employed. However, such Employee will continue to retain an interest in the Plan (herein referred to as his retained interest equal to the original non-forfeitable amount, as determined in accordance with Section V(d) above. 
 (B) Such retained interest and any additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit to which the Employee is entitled shall be payable following the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service at the time and in the manner provided in Section X(a)(3). If the Employee dies before retirement, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such retained interest will be determined in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions. 
 (C) If the Employee continues in service after attaining age 60, the Employee s retained interest shall commence after his subsequent Separation from Service at the time and in the manner provided in Section X(a)(3) and shall be calculated using reduction and conversion factors applicable to an age 60 commencement (but based on the spouse at actual retirement, if any). 
 (c) Beneficiary and Spousal Consent. An Employee s beneficiary for the purposes of this Plan shall be the beneficiary designated by him under the GE Pension Plan, except in those instances where a separate beneficiary designation is in effect under this Plan. The provisions of the GE Pension Plan with respect to the designation or selection of a beneficiary shall apply to the designation or selection of a beneficiary under this Plan. For purposes of clarity, the requirement in the GE Pension Plan for a Spouse s Consent to the designation or selection of a beneficiary, or the election of alternative distribution forms hereunder, shall apply under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, any elections governing beneficiaries made in accordance with 
 21 

Section VII(b) of this Plan, as restated July 1, 1991, or subsequent actions of the Company related thereto, shall continue to apply. No such elections, however, shall direct a different time or form of payment of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits from the time and form of payment prescribed under this Plan, nor shall any Employee who did not make such an election before this restatement be permitted to submit such an election. 
 (d) With respect to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, any provision of this Section X or other provision of this Plan that refers to the time or form of benefits under the GE Pension Plan shall be deemed to be a reference to the terms of the GE Pension Plan in effect on December 31, 2008. 
 (e) The Company shall be entitled to withhold all applicable withholding taxes, including, but not limited to, federal income taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act FICA taxes, and state income taxes, from an Employee s Supplementary Pension.

If any attempt is made to alienate, pledge or charge any such interest or any such benefit for any debt, liabilities in tort or contract, or otherwise, of any Employee, retired employee, Surviving Spouse, or beneficiary, contrary to the prohibitions of the preceding sentence, then the Pension Board in its discretion may suspend or forfeit the interests of such person and during the period of such suspension, or in case of forfeiture, the Pension Board shall hold such interest for the benefit of, or shall make the benefit payments to which such person would otherwise be entitled (in the same time and form) to the designated 
 29 

beneficiary or to some member of such Employee s, retired employee s, Surviving Spouse s or beneficiary s family to be selected in the discretion of the Pension Board.

 (c) No Employee and no other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Plan that are not expressly granted in this Plan. Participation in this Plan does not give any person any right to be retained in the Service of his employer. The right and power of the Company to dismiss or discharge any Employee is expressly reserved. 
 (d) Except to the extent that the same are governed by the federal law (including Section 409A of the Code), the law of the State of New York shall govern the construction and administration of this Plan.

 (c) An Employee who is reemployed by the Company on or after January 1, 2021, after becoming entitled to or after commencing an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit shall not be eligible for any benefits under the Plan with respect to the Employee s period of reemployment, and the amount of the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit to which such Employee was entitled prior to reemployment shall not change as a result of the Employee s reemployment. 
 (d) In the case of reemployment by the Company before January 1, 2021, any post-reemployment benefit 
 (1) shall be subject to the principles of this Part II as if it were a separate benefit but 
 (2) shall be calculated by subtracting (i) any benefit payable for the period prior to such reemployment from (ii) any benefit determined as of the subsequent Termination Date and payable as of the subsequent Separation from Service, taking into account for purposes of this clause (ii) all Benefit Service and Compensation (including pre-reemployment Benefit Service and Compensation) as of the subsequent Termination Date. 
 Consistent with the foregoing, if a post-reemployment benefit is payable consistent with the principles of this Part II, such benefit shall be paid at the time and in the form prescribed by Section XIX (Time and Form of Payment), and the provisions of Section XX (Payments Upon Death) shall apply separately to the post-reemployment benefit, in both cases disregarding how any pre-reemployment benefit is being or has been paid. 
 (e) If an Employee was eligible for an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit, leaves the Service of the Company and all Affiliates before becoming entitled to such benefit, and is rehired by the Company on or after January 1, 2021, such Employee shall not become entitled to the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit for which the Employee was previously eligible, and such Employee s prior Benefit Service, Annual Average Compensation, and Eligibility Service shall be forfeited. Such Employee also shall not be eligible for any post-reemployment benefit under the Plan. 
 (f) If an Employee was eligible for an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit, has a Termination Date before becoming entitled to such benefit, and remains continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate following such Termination Date until the Employee is reemployed by the Company (including reemployment following a transfer to the Company from an Affiliate) on or after January 1, 2021 
 40 

(1) such Employee shall have the Eligibility Service, Benefit Service, and Annual Average Compensation that were credited to the Employee as of the Employee s Termination Date reinstated as of the Employee s first day of reemployment with the Company 
 (2) such Employee shall be credited with Eligibility Service for service with an Affiliate to the extent such service is RSP Service as defined in the GE Retirement Savings Plan, regardless of whether the Employee is described in subsection (a) of the definition of Eligibility Service in Section XXII and 
 (3) the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit to which such Employee may become entitled during a period of reemployment with the Company shall be calculated taking into account only the Employee s Benefit Service and Compensation as of the Employee s most recent Termination Date preceding the Employee s first period of reemployment with the Company that begins on or after January 1, 2021. 
 (g) Principles similar to those in subsections (a) through (f) shall apply if an Employee is reemployed more than once. 
 (h) Prior to January 1, 2021, if an Employee ceased to be eligible to continue accruing Benefit Service solely because he was no longer assigned to the GE executive or higher career band, his Executive Retirement Installment Benefit was calculated taking into account his Compensation as an Employee attributable to periods after he was no longer so assigned, even though he could earn Benefit Service only during periods while so assigned. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit of such an Employee who was not assigned to the GE executive or higher career band on December 31, 2020, shall be calculated taking into account only his Compensation as an Employee earned through December 31, 2020, regardless of whether such Employee is again assigned to the GE executive or higher career band on or after January 1, 2021. Further notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit of an Employee who ceases to be eligible to continue accruing Benefit Service on or after January 1, 2021, solely because he is no longer assigned to the GE executive or higher career band shall be calculated taking into account only his Compensation earned as an Employee prior to such change in career band. An Employee described in this Section XXI(h) who is again assigned to the GE executive or higher career band during a period of time beginning on or after January 1, 2021, shall not accrue Benefit Service during such period.

Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the entities within GE HealthCare and GE Energy are no longer participating companies under the Plan. Each individual whose benefit is a HealthCare Benefit Liability or an Energy Benefit Liability is an Affected Transferee. Except as otherwise set forth in this Appendix A (with respect to Reverse Plan Spin-Offs), an Affected Transferee who becomes employed by the Company on or after the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be ineligible to participate in the Plan. 
 The HealthCare Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the Plan for (i) active employees of GE HealthCare, (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare business, and (iii) certain former employees whose last employer of record within General Electric Company and its Affiliates is not attributable to any of General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare, or energy businesses (or is attributable to General Electric Company s aviation or energy businesses in limited cases), in each case as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the Plan for (i) active employees of GE Energy, and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 Consistent with treatment under the GE Pension Plan, benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses will remain in the Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. (For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals who have accrued GE Pension Plan benefits as of the Plan Spin-Off Date, the HealthCare Benefit Liabilities and the Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan for individuals whose benefits under the GE Pension Plan are transferred as of the Plan Spin-Off Date to the GE HealthCare Pension Plan or the GE Energy Pension Plan, as applicable.) 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the Plan , shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the Plan (even if the Affected Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or its Affiliates, unless the Affected Transferee s benefit is transferred back to this Plan in 
 46

 Section III. Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under the Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy or (2) is hired by an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from this Plan to the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable (each such transfer to a Spin-Off Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Sections I and II of this Appendix A and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as an Affected Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be (i) if the individual does not have a benefit under the GE Pension Plan, the date of such individual s transfer of employment or hire, as applicable, or (ii) if the individual has a benefit under the GE Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such individual s benefit under the GE Pension Plan. 
 
 If the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off occurs after the Affected Transferee s transfer of employment or hire, such Affected Transferee shall continue to accrue service and benefits (if applicable) for the period until the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off (unless the Affected Transferee s new position involves a change in status under the terms of the Spin-Off Plan), such that the Affected Transferee s benefit under the Spin-Off Plan after 
 47 

the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be the same as if the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the applicable transfer of employment or rehire. 
 
 Immediately after the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off, each Affected Transferee included in the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall cease to be a participant in the Plan (and shall become a participant in the Spin-Off Plan). No individual whose benefits are transferred from the Plan to the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan shall have any claims or rights against General Electric Company or any of its Affiliates in respect of benefits under the Plan. 
 
 Section IV. Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under a Spin-Off Plan (1) transfers employment directly to General Electric Company or an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy or (2) is hired by General Electric Company or an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Plan is still an Affiliate of General Electric Company (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from the applicable Spin-Off Plan to the Plan (each such transfer to the Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective (i) if the Transferred Participant does not have a benefit under the GE HealthCare Pension Plan or GE Energy Pension Plan, upon the date of the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, as applicable, or (ii) if the Transferred Participant has a benefit under the GE HealthCare Pension Plan or GE Energy Pension Plan, the date that the Transferred Participant s benefit under such pension plan transfers to the GE Pension Plan (the Transfer Date ). Each such Transferred Participant shall resume participation in the Plan upon the Transfer Date. Regardless of whether the Transfer Date is the same as the date of the change in employment, the Transferred Participant s status under the Plan as of the Transfer Date shall be the same as if the Reverse Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the change in employment (preserving the Transferred Participant s status under the Spin-Off Plan immediately prior to such change in employment, unless the Transferred Participant s new position involves a change in status under the Plan), with service crediting and benefit accrual (if applicable) for periods after the change in employment being determined in accordance with the Plan s rules for the Transferred Participant s new position. (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under the applicable Spin-Off Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the Plan immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off.

 Exhibit 10(e) 

GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan 
 Effective as of January 1, 2023 

 Introduction 
 The GE Supplementary Pension Plan consists of two parts as set forth herein. Part I describes Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefits, and Part II describes Executive Retirement Installment Benefits. 
 Effective January 1, 2023 in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare, and energy businesses, respectively, the benefits and liabilities under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (renamed the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan) attributable to certain individuals are transferred to this Plan, as described in Appendix A. After December 31, 2022, no individual whose benefit is transferred to this Plan from the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (nor any of their beneficiaries) shall accrue additional benefits or service, or have any rights, under, or with respect to, the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (even if such individual is subsequently employed by, or has service with, the General Electric Company or the GE Affiliates), unless the individual s benefit is transferred back to the GE Supplementary Pension Plan in accordance with Appendix A. Because this Plan is a continuation of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, this document includes the provisions of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan that applied before January 1, 2023. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective January 1, 2011, Part I of the Plan is closed. Accordingly, an Employee shall be eligible for a Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefit only if he participated in this Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (and shall actually receive such benefit only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). For purposes of determining whether an Employee participated in the Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (a) any period of service described in Section XV(b) shall be disregarded and (b) an Employee shall be deemed to have met such requirement if he waived participation in the GE Pension Plan, but was otherwise eligible to participate in this Plan and is not an Excluded Employee or Ineligible Employee under the GE Pension Plan. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective December 31, 2020, benefits under Part I of the Plan are frozen, and no Employee shall accrue benefits under Part I of the Plan after such date. Prior to January 1, 2021, Part I and Part II of the Plan provided mutually exclusive benefits, and eligible Employees earned their entire benefits under the Plan either under Part I or Part II, but not both. However, Employees who are eligible for and participating under Part I of the Plan on December 31, 2020, shall commence participation under Part II of the Plan on January 1, 2021. An Employee will be considered to be eligible for and participating under Part I of the Plan and will be eligible to participate under Part II of the Plan only if, on December 31, 2020, the Employee (A) was assigned to the GE executive or higher career band (B) was employed by the Company and (C) was enrolled in the GE Pension Plan (i.e., had not waived or suspended participation in the GE Pension Plan). 
 Further notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Part II of the Plan is closed effective January 1, 2021. Accordingly, an Employee shall be eligible for an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit only if he was eligible for and participating under Part I or Part II of the Plan on December 31, 2020 (and shall actually receive such benefit only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). For the avoidance of doubt, an 

Employee who was previously eligible for Part II of the Plan will not be eligible to accrue future Benefit Service under Part II of the Plan if, on December 31, 2020, the Employee (A) was not assigned to the GE executive or higher career band or (B) was not employed by the Company. 
 The Pension Board may adopt such rules as it deems necessary to determine which Part of the Plan applies to which Employees. 
 As described in Section XXIII, certain provisions of Part I apply to Part II, but no provisions of Part II apply to Part I (except that the service disregard rule in Section XV(b) shall apply in determining which Part of the Plan applies to which Employees).

Part I Supplementary Pension Annuity Benefits (closed to new participants and frozen) 
 As more fully described in the Introduction (and subject to the rules thereof), this Part I of the Plan is closed effective January 1, 2011, and an Employee shall be eligible to participate under this Part I (and not Part II) only if he participated in the Plan on or before December 31, 2010 (and shall actually receive a benefit under this Part only if he meets all the other applicable requirements therefor). In addition, effective December 31, 2020, benefits under Part I of the Plan are frozen, and no Employee shall accrue benefits under Part I of the Plan on and after such date. Employees who were eligible for and participating under this Part I of the Plan on December 31, 2020, shall commence participation under Part II of the Plan on January 1, 2021.

The Chief Executive Officer of the Sponsor, or his delegate, may approve the continued participation in the Plan of an individual who is localized outside the United States as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate and who otherwise meets all of the eligibility conditions set forth herein during such localization. The designated individual s service and pay while localized, with appropriate offsets for local country benefits, shall be counted in calculating his Supplementary Pension.

 An Employee who was eligible to participate under this Part I of the Plan and who, before becoming entitled to a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan, left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates shall not again become eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan during any period of reemployment with the Company that commences on or after January 1, 2021.

In computing an Employee s Average Annual Compensation, his normal straight-time earnings shall be substituted for his actual Compensation for any month in which such normal straight-time 
 5

 6 

exclude from the computation of Compensation and subject to the powers of the Committee under Section IX hereof.

 Section IV. Amount of Supplementary Pension at Optional or Disability Retirement 
 (a) The annual Supplementary Pension payable to an eligible Employee who, following attainment of age 60, retires hereunder on an optional retirement date within the meaning of Section V.1. of the GE Pension Plan shall be computed in the manner provided by Section III(a) (for an Employee retiring on his normal retirement date) but taking into account only Pension Benefit Service and Average Annual Compensation to the earlier of the actual date of optional retirement or December 31, 2020. Such Supplementary Pension shall be subject to the limitations specified in Section IX. In the event such Employee is a New Plan Participant on the date of his termination of Service, such Supplementary Pension, as so limited, shall be reduced to reflect commencement before his normal retirement date by applying the methodology provided under Section V.3. of the GE Pension Plan. Consistent with the foregoing, such reduction shall equal 5 12 for each month from the first month following such Employee s Separation from Service to his normal retirement date. Said reduction shall not be imposed, however, in the event such Employee s Separation from Service occurs on or after the Employee s (1) attainment of at least age 62 and (2) completion of at least 25 years of Pension Qualification Service. An eligible Employee who did not retire hereunder before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until

retirement on an optional retirement date within the meaning of Section V.1 of the GE Pension Plan in order to receive a Supplementary Pension computed under this Section IV(a).

Such Supplementary Pension shall be subject to the limitations specified in Section IX. In the event the Employee is a New Plan Participant, such Supplementary Pension, as so limited, shall be reduced by 25 consistent with the methodology provided under Section VII.3. of the GE Pension Plan to reflect commencement before the Employee s earliest optional retirement age. An eligible Employee who did not retire hereunder before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement on a Disability Pension under Section VII of the GE Pension Plan in order to receive a Supplementary Pension computed under this Section IV(b). 
 If the Disability Pension payable to the Employee under the GE Pension Plan is discontinued thereunder as a result of the cessation of the Employee s disability prior to the attainment of age 60, the Supplementary Pension provided under this Section IV(b) shall be forfeited and the Employee shall only be eligible for a Supplementary Pension to the extent he separately qualifies under another provision set forth herein. 
 Section V. Special Benefit Protection for Certain Employees 
 (a) A former Employee whose Service with the Company is terminated on or after June 27, 1988, before attainment of age 60 and after completion of 25 or more years of Pension Qualification Service who does not withdraw his contributions from the GE Pension Plan before retirement and who meets one of the following conditions shall be eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Plan commencing at the time set forth in Section X.(a). An eligible Employee who did not meet such requirements before January 1, 2021, must additionally remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until meeting one of the following conditions to be eligible for a Supplementary Pension under this Plan. 
 (1) The Employee s Service is terminated because of a Plant Closing. 
 12 

(2) The Employee s Service is terminated for transfer to a Successor Employer. The conditions of this paragraph (2) shall not be satisfied, however, if the transferred Employee retires under the GE Pension Plan before July 1, 2000 and prior to the later of (A) his termination of service with the Successor Employer and (B the first of the month following attainment of age 60. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section V(a) shall not apply if all Plan liabilities with respect to the Employee are transferred to a spin-off plan maintained by such Successor Employer or an affiliate thereof. 
 (3) The Employee s Service terminated after one year on layoff with protected service. 
 Effective July 1, 1994 and regardless of whether the Employee terminated Service on, before or after such date, for purposes of this Section V(a) and any other provision of this Plan, a former Employee will be deemed to have withdrawn his contributions from the GE Pension Plan at such time the payment of benefits attributable to such contributions commences, regardless of whether such contributions are paid in the form of a lump sum or an annuity. 
 (b) The Supplementary Pension, if any, for Employees who meet the conditions in Section V(a) shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section IV(a) (other than the requirement to remain continuously in the Service of the Company or an Affiliate from January 1, 2021, until retirement), including the imposition of the reduction described therein to reflect a commencement date occurring before normal retirement date in the case of Employees who are New Plan Participants on the date of their termination of Service. For purposes of making this calculation, the Employee s (1) Pension Benefit Service to the earlier of the Service termination date or December 31, 2020, shall be considered (2) Average Annual Compensation shall be based on the last 120 completed months before the earlier of such Service termination date or December 31, 2020 and (3) Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit shall be determined as though the Employee s retirement date was the earlier of such Service termination date or December 31, 2020. 
 (c) No Supplementary Pension shall be payable to any former Employee who elects to accelerate the commencement of his pension under the GE Pension Plan under Section XI.4.b(iii) therein, nor shall any death or survivor benefits be payable hereunder with respect to such an Employee. 
 (d) In the event a former Employee whose Service with the Company was terminated under circumstances entitling him to a benefit pursuant to this Section V is reemployed, such Employee will retain a non-forfeitable interest in a benefit equal to the amount payable under this provision attributable to such Employee s first period of service (with the calculation of any offsets determined in accordance with established administrative practices and based upon assumptions in effect as of such Employee s first termination date). The same principle shall apply in determining the 
 13 

non-forfeitable interest hereunder of similarly-situated Employees with less than 25 years of Pension Qualification Service who, as a result of Company or Pension Board action, attained a non-forfeitable interest in their Supplementary Pension upon transfer to a successor employer and are subsequently re-employed by the Company. 
 (e) In the event General Electric Company announces its intention to dispose of a predominant share of the businesses of General Electric Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries, Employees of any such GE Capital operations to be disposed of or discontinued in connection with such action will be eligible for Special Benefit Protection treatment as described in this Section V by meeting the conditions for such treatment set forth in this Section V, except that they will only be required to have completed at least 10 years (instead of 25 years) of Pension Qualification Service as of their termination because of a Plant Closing, transfer to Successor Employer or layoff after one year on protected service. This paragraph (e) shall not apply to an Employee who terminates Service for any other reason, or is assigned to (or offered employment with) any continuing operation of the Company or any Affiliate (including a continuing GE Capital operation). This paragraph (e) also shall not apply unless the Employee executes a Release on such terms and in such manner as the Company may require in its absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pension Board may in its absolute discretion prescribe such additional conditions and other rules as it deems necessary or advisable in applying this paragraph (e), including the designation of groups of employees who shall and shall not be eligible for this Special Benefit Protection treatment. 
 This paragraph (e) is intended to serve as a special retention arrangement in connection with General Electric Company s announcement to dispose of a predominant share of the businesses of General Electric Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries. This paragraph (e) shall not apply to any employee who terminates service prior to such an announcement or is on protected service at the time of such announcement, except as otherwise provided by the Pension Board in its absolute discretion. 
 (f) Employees of the General Electric Company GE corporate division who are laid off as a result of the November 9, 2021 announcement to restructure into three industry leading public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy (the Transition will be eligible for Special Benefit Protection treatment described in this Section V by meeting the conditions for such treatment set forth in this Section V, except that the service eligibility requirement will be met if they have completed at least 10 years (instead of 25 years) of Pension Qualification Service as of their Separation from Service, or would have completed at least 10 years of Pension Qualification Service by December 31, 2023. This paragraph (f) shall not apply to an Employee who (i) is laid off from any other business or division of GE, (ii) is laid off from the corporate division of GE for any other reason, (iii) is assigned to (or offered employment with) any continuing operation of the Company or any Affiliate 
 14

This paragraph (f) also shall not apply unless the Employee executes a Release on such terms and in such manner as the Company may require in its absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pension Board may in its absolute discretion prescribe such additional conditions and other rules as it deems necessary or advisable in applying this paragraph (f), including the designation of groups of employees who shall and shall not be eligible for this Special Benefit Protection treatment. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing and any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the employment of an Employee who vests in a Supplementary Pension pursuant to this paragraph (f) is terminated for Cause or if the Pension Board determines in its sole discretion that such Employee has engaged in conduct that (i) constitutes a breach of the Release, (ii) results in (or has the potential to cause) material harm financially, reputationally, or otherwise to the Company or an Affiliate or their successor entities or (iii) occurred prior to the Employee s Separation from Service and would give rise to a termination for Cause (regardless of whether such conduct is discovered before, during or after the Employee s Separation from Service), the Employee shall forfeit the Employee s right to any unpaid Supplementary Pension under this Plan and may be required to repay any Supplementary Pension amounts previously paid under the Plan to the extent recovery is permitted by law. The remedy under this subsection (f) is not exclusive and shall not limit any right of the Company or any Affiliate under applicable law, including (but not limited to) a remedy under (i) Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange or national securities association on which shares of the Company may be traded, and or (iii) any Company policy adopted with respect to compensation recoupment. 
 Section VI. Survivor Benefits 
 If a survivor benefit applies with respect to an Employee s Supplementary Pension pursuant to Section X below, his Supplementary Pension shall be reduced in the same manner as the pension payable under the GE Pension Plan is reduced under such circumstances in accordance with the principles of Section IX of the GE Pension Plan. 
 Section VII. Payments Upon Death 
 If an eligible Employee dies in active Service or following retirement on a Supplementary Pension, or if a former Employee entitled to a Supplementary Pension pursuant to Section V dies prior to such retirement, (1) the principles of Section X of the GE Pension Plan (disregarding any references therein to Employee contributions) shall apply to determine whether a death benefit is payable to the beneficiary or Surviving Spouse of such Employee under this Supplementary Pension Plan, and (2) any such death benefit shall be computed and paid in accordance with such principles, based on the Supplementary Pension payable under this Plan provided, however, that 
 15 

(a) with respect to any pre-retirement death benefit attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits where a Surviving Spouse otherwise would have a choice to receive such benefit as an annuity in accordance with the principles of Section X.9 of the GE Pension Plan (Preretirement Spouse Benefit) or as a lump sum in accordance with the principles of either Section X.2 (Five Year Certain (Death After Optional Retirement Age)) or Section X.3 (Five Year Certain (Death After 15 Years Pension Qualification Service)) of the GE Pension Plan, the lump sum value of such benefit under each applicable paragraph shall be determined (in the case of the Preretirement Spouse Benefit, based on the actuarial assumptions described in paragraph 3 of Section XV of the GE Pension Plan), and then the Surviving Spouse shall receive whichever resulting lump sum value is larger as of the first day of the month following the Employee s death. For purposes of clarity, such Surviving Spouse shall not be eligible to receive an annuity in the form of the Preretirement Spouse Benefit under the principles of Section X.9 of the GE Pension Plan 
 (b) with respect to any post-retirement death benefit attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits under the principles of Section X.11 of the GE Pension Plan (Five Year Certain (No Survivor Benefit)), the calculation of the lump sum shall be determined without making any discount to present value. Consistent with the foregoing, such lump sum shall equal the excess of (1) 5 times the Employee s Supplementary Pension payable as a single life annuity over (2) the total payments under this Plan to the Employee and 
 (c) no pre-retirement death benefit shall be payable under this Section VII to an Employee who dies in active Service while reemployed after the Employee left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates, if the Employee left the Service of the Company and all Affiliates (1) on or after January 1, 2021, and (2) before becoming entitled to a Supplementary Pension under this Part I of the Plan. 
 Section VIII. Employees Retired Before July 1, 1973 
 Reserved-See Section VIII of this Plan prior to this reservation. 
 Section IX. Limitation on Benefits 
 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the sum of 
 (1) the Supplementary Pension otherwise payable to an Employee hereunder 
 (2) the Employee s Annual Pension Payable under the GE Pension Plan 
 (3) 100 of the Annual Estimated Social Security Benefit but before any adjustment for less than 35 years of Pension Benefit Service 
 16 

(4) the Employee s annual excess benefit, if any, payable under the GE Excess Benefit Plan and or any successor thereto and 
 (5) The Employee s annual benefit, if any, payable under the GE Executive Special Early Retirement Option and Plant Closing Retirement Option Plan and or any successor thereto 
 exceeds 60 of his Average Annual Compensation (with such Supplementary Pension and the amounts set forth in (2), (4) and (5) above determined before imposition of any applicable reduction factor or adjustment for optional or disability retirement, a survivor benefit or otherwise), such Supplementary Pension (as so determined) shall be reduced by the amount of the excess. Any further reductions or adjustments prescribed herein, including those applicable to Employees who are New Plan Participants on the date of their termination of Service, shall be applied against such reduced Supplementary Pension. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan (other than Section XIV(e)) to the contrary, the amount of Supplementary Pension and any death or survivor benefit payable to or on behalf of any Employee who is or was an Officer shall be determined in accordance with such general rules and regulations as may be adopted by a Committee appointed by the Board of Directors for such purpose, subject to the limitation that any such Supplementary Pension or death benefit may not exceed the amount which would be payable hereunder in the absence of such rules and regulations. 
 Section X. Payment of Supplementary Pension Benefits 
 (a) Time and Form of Payment. This Section governs the time and form of payment of the Supplementary Pension on and after the retirement of an eligible Employee. See Section VII above for certain additional rules regarding Payments on Death. 
 (1) General Provisions. Supplementary Pensions shall be payable in monthly installments, each equal to 1 12th of the annual amount determined under the applicable Section. In addition, the provisions of the GE Pension Plan with respect to the following shall apply to amounts payable under this Plan 
 (A) The date of the last payment of any Supplementary Pension. 
 (B) Treatment of amounts payable to a missing person. 
 In no event shall the accelerated payment option of Section XI.4.b(iii) of the GE Pension Plan apply with respect to this Plan. 
 (2) Grandfathered Plan Benefits. Payment of Supplementary Pensions provided for herein which are attributable to 
 17 

Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be in the same form and commence as of the same date as distribution is made pursuant to the Participant s election under the GE Pension Plan (subject to the special rule in Section III(b) of this Plan for Employees over age 70- ). 
 (3) Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 (A) Time of Payment . 
 (i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) below (relating to disability pensions), all payments of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month after the Employee s Separation from Service or the Employee s attainment of age 60, if later provided, however, that if an Employee is a Specified Employee, payment of any Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit shall not be made within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. In the event distribution to a Specified Employee is so delayed, payment of the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit shall begin on the first day of the seventh month following Separation from Service and the first such payment shall be increased to reflect the missed payments (with interest accumulated in accordance with Pension Board procedures). 
 (ii) Payment of Supplementary Pensions attributable to disability as provided for in Section IV(b) shall commence on the first day of the month after the Employee s Separation from Service provided, however, that the Employee shall forfeit any payments attributable to months prior to the first date on which a Disability Pension is actually paid under Section VII of the GE Pension Plan. For this purpose, any retroactive payments that may be made under the GE Pension Plan shall be disregarded and no corresponding retroactive payments shall be made hereunder. 
 (B) Form of Payment. Unless an Employee makes an effective election pursuant to paragraph (B)(i) below, such benefits shall be paid as a 50 Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.1 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto (for Employees who are married at the time their Supplementary Pension begins) or as a single life annuity in accordance with the principles of Section XV, X.11 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto (for Employees who are not married 
 18 

at the time their Supplementary Pension begins) provided, however, that 
 (i) As an alternative to the normal distribution forms set forth in this paragraph (B), a married Employee may elect to receive all payments of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits as a single life annuity as described above, a 100 Alternative Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.3 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto, or a 75 Alternative Survivor Benefit in accordance with the principles of Section IX.10 and other provisions of the GE Pension Plan applicable thereto. In the case of a disability pension payable under Section IV(b) above, however, the 100 Alternative Survivor Benefit shall not be available. An election under this paragraph may not be made more than 60 days following the date as of which payment is otherwise to commence in accordance with paragraph (3)(A) above. For purposes of clarity, if an Employee is a Specified Employee for whom the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit is delayed in accordance with paragraph (3)(A)(i) above, an election under this paragraph may be made anytime within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. If such Specified Employee dies during the six-month delay, the Specified Employee will be treated as if he retired before death, without regard to such delay, and commenced receiving his benefit either in accordance with his actual election under this paragraph as to the form of distribution, or in accordance the rules in paragraph (3)(B) above if no such election was made before death. 
 (ii) Regardless of the initial form of payment for Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, the revocation feature provided in Section IX.8 of the GE Pension Plan shall not apply to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 (b) Impact of Reemployment. If an Employee is reemployed by the Company or an Affiliate, the following provisions shall apply with respect to the determination of the Employee s Supplementary Pension 
 (1) Grandfathered Plan Benefits . If the Employee s pension under the GE Pension Plan is suspended or may not commence for any month in accordance with the re-employment provisions of that plan, the Employee s Supplementary Pension attributable to Grandfathered Plan Benefits that would otherwise be payable during such re-employment shall be forfeited under this Plan. For this purpose, any addition to the Employee s Supplementary 
 19 

Pension which he may earn hereunder following such re-employment shall not cause such Grandfathered Plan Benefits to be reclassified as Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. Upon the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service, the Employee s original distribution election, if any, with respect to such original Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be disregarded and such original Grandfathered Plan Benefit (adjusted for any additional accrual or reduction) will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan in effect at the time of such subsequent Separation from Service applicable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. If such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such original Grandfathered Plan Benefits (as so adjusted) will be determined in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions then applicable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to Grandfathered Specified Employees. 
 (2) Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits . If the Employee is rehired after having commenced receiving his Supplementary Pension, and in accordance with the terms of the GE Pension Plan, the Employee would have had his pension therefrom suspended upon such re-employment, the Employee shall forfeit any benefits from this Plan attributable to his Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit that would otherwise be payable during such re-employment. Upon the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service 
 (A) If the Employee s Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit is the same or has decreased, then 
 (i) the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit earned during the first period of employment will resume immediately in the same form of distribution and with the same conversion and reduction factors that applied to the original distribution of such benefit 
 (ii) if such original distribution form was a 50 Survivor Benefit, 75 Alternative Survivor Benefit or 100 Alternative Survivor Benefit, any survivor benefits will be payable only if the Surviving Spouse was married to the Participant at the time of his original retirement and 
 (iii) such benefit will be reduced, as necessary, if the Employee s Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit decreases as a result of his second period of employment. 
 If such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, then any death or survivor benefits attributable to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits will be based on such 
 20 

original form of distribution with payment commencing on the first of the month following death. Survivor benefits will be payable only if the Surviving Spouse was married to the Employee at the time of his original retirement and is otherwise eligible to receive payments hereunder. 
 (B) If the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit payable upon such subsequent Separation from Service has increased as a result of the Employee s second period of employment, then the above provisions set forth in paragraph (2)(A) will govern the Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit earned during the first period of employment (as applicable), and the following will apply to any additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit 
 (i) the additional benefit amount shall be distributed separately commencing on the first of the month following such subsequent Separation from Service based upon the Employee s age, marital status and the otherwise applicable Plan terms at that time and any new distribution election made by the Employee in accordance with Section X(a)(3) above, and 
 (ii) if such subsequent Separation from Service is by reason of death, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit will be determined separately in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions. 
 (3) If an Employee is rehired under circumstances where he previously accrued a non-forfeitable interest in his Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit but had not commenced receiving such benefit prior to his reemployment, the following shall apply 
 (A) Such Employee shall forfeit the dollar amount of any Plan Benefits that would otherwise be paid while re-employed. However, such Employee will continue to retain an interest in the Plan (herein referred to as his retained interest equal to the original non-forfeitable amount, as determined in accordance with Section V(d) above. 
 (B) Such retained interest and any additional Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefit to which the Employee is entitled shall be payable following the Employee s subsequent Separation from Service at the time and in the manner provided in Section X(a)(3). If the Employee dies before retirement, any survivor or death benefits attributable to such retained interest will be determined in accordance with this Plan s pre-retirement death and survivor benefit provisions. 
 21 

(C) If the Employee continues in service after attaining age 60, the Employee s retained interest shall commence after his subsequent Separation from Service at the time and in the manner provided in Section X(a)(3) and shall be calculated using reduction and conversion factors applicable to an age 60 commencement (but based on the spouse at actual retirement, if any). 
 (c) Beneficiary and Spousal Consent. An Employee s beneficiary for the purposes of this Plan shall be the beneficiary designated by him under the GE Pension Plan, except in those instances where a separate beneficiary designation is in effect under this Plan. The provisions of the GE Pension Plan with respect to the designation or selection of a beneficiary shall apply to the designation or selection of a beneficiary under this Plan. For purposes of clarity, the requirement in the GE Pension Plan for a Spouse s Consent to the designation or selection of a beneficiary, or the election of alternative distribution forms hereunder, shall apply under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, any elections governing beneficiaries made in accordance with Section VII(b) of this Plan, as restated July 1, 1991, or subsequent actions of the Company related thereto, shall continue to apply. No such elections, however, shall direct a different time or form of payment of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits from the time and form of payment prescribed under this Plan, nor shall any Employee who did not make such an election before this restatement be permitted to submit such an election. 
 (d) With respect to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits, any provision of this Section X or other provision of this Plan that refers to the time or form of benefits under the GE Pension Plan shall be deemed to be a reference to the terms of the GE Pension Plan in effect on December 31, 2008. 
 (e) The Company shall be entitled to withhold all applicable withholding taxes, including, but not limited to, federal income taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act FICA taxes, and state income taxes, from an Employee s Supplementary Pension. The actuarially determined present value of an Employee s Supplementary Pension is required by law to be subject to FICA taxation (Social Security tax, Medicare tax, and if applicable, additional Medicare tax) on the date on which the present value of the Employee s Supplementary Pension becomes reasonably ascertainable (generally, the date on which the Employee makes an effective election as to the form of payment). As a condition of participation in the Plan, the Employee shall be required to make arrangements to satisfy the required FICA tax withholding, including being required to remit to the Company the amount necessary to satisfy his or her withholding requirements. The Company shall have the power and the right to withhold the amount necessary to satisfy an Employee s FICA tax obligation from the amount payable under the Plan or to establish other means to satisfy such obligation, including, to the extent permitted by law, the Company s payment of any required tax on the Employee s behalf 
 22 

subject to repayment by the Employee, as specified under a policy adopted by the Pension Board.

Such process is intended to comply with Section 503 of ERISA and shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

 (g) Principles similar to those in subsections (a) through (f) shall apply if an Employee is reemployed more than once. 
 (h) Prior to January 1, 2021, if an Employee ceased to be eligible to continue accruing Benefit Service solely because he was no longer assigned to the GE executive or higher career band, his Executive Retirement Installment Benefit was calculated taking into account his Compensation as an Employee attributable to periods after he was no longer so assigned, even though he could earn Benefit Service only during periods while so assigned. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Executive Retirement Installment Benefit of such an Employee who was not assigned to the GE executive or higher career band on December 31, 2020, shall be calculated taking into account only his Compensation as an Employee earned through December 31, 2020, regardless of whether such Employee is again assigned to the GE executive or higher career band on or after January 1, 2021.

An Employee described in this Section XXI(h) who is again assigned to the Sponsor s executive or higher career band during a period of time beginning on or after January 1, 2021, shall not accrue Benefit Service during such period.

Appendix A 
 Transfer of GE Energy Benefits and Liabilities from GE Supplementary Pension Plan 
 
 Section I. Allocation of Employees 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the Energy Benefit Liabilities (as defined below) are transferred to this Plan (the Plan Spin-Off ). The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan for (i) active employees of GE Energy, and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. (For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals who have accrued GE Pension Plan benefits as of the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan for individuals whose benefits under the GE Pension Plan are transferred as of the Plan Spin-Off Date to the GE Energy Pension Plan.) The participants transferred to this Plan are the GE Energy Transferees. No GE Energy Transferee shall have any claims against General Electric Company or any of its affiliates (other than the Sponsor while it is an affiliate of General Electric Company) in respect of benefits under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan or the Plan. 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s energy business will remain in the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the GE Energy Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan , shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan (even if the GE Energy Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or the GE Affiliates, unless the GE Energy Transferee s benefit is transferred back to the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan in accordance with this Appendix A). Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, this Plan assumes the Energy Benefit Liabilities as a continuation of the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan and each GE Energy Transferee is a participant in this Plan. Each GE Energy Transferee s status under this Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the GE Energy Transferee s status under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each GE Energy Transferee s service with General Electric Company and the GE Affiliates credited under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under this Plan, and (ii) no GE Energy Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, vesting, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or the corporate spin-offs of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses. 
 46 

Section II. Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities 
 The Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of each GE Energy Transferee under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan immediately before the Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under this Plan immediately after the Plan Spin-Off. 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off, the Sponsor and its Affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under this Plan and for all payment obligations hereunder. 
 
 Section III. Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan (1) transfers employment directly to a GE Affiliate that is part of GE Energy or (2) is hired by a GE Affiliate that is part of GE Energy, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from the GE Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable, to this Plan (each such transfer to this Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be effective (i) if the individual does not have a benefit under the GE Aerospace Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan, upon the date of such individual s transfer of employment or hire, as applicable, or (ii) if the individual has a benefit under the GE Aerospace Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such individual s benefit under such pension plan to the GE Energy Pension Plan (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Sections I and II of this Appendix A and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as a GE Energy Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such GE Energy Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date. 
 
 Immediately after the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off, each GE Energy Transferee included in the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall cease to be a participant in the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable, and shall become a participant in the Plan. Regardless of whether the Subsequent Spin-Off Date is the same as the date of the change in employment, the GE Energy Transferee s status under the Plan as of the Subsequent Spin-Off Date shall be the same as if the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the change in employment (preserving the GE Energy Transferee s status under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan (as applicable) immediately prior to such change in employment, unless the GE HealthCare Transferee s new position involves a change in status under the Plan), with service crediting and benefit accrual (as applicable) for periods after the change in employment being determined in accordance with the Plan s rules for the GE Energy Transferee s new position. 
 47 

Section IV. Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under this Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an Affiliate that is part of GE Aerospace or GE HealthCare or (2) is hired by an Affiliate that is part of GE Aerospace or GE HealthCare, the benefits and liabilities for such individual (each such individual, a Transferred Participant shall be transferred from this Plan to the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable (each such transfer from the Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective (i) if the Transferred Participant does not have a benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan, upon the date of the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, as applicable, or (ii) if the Transferred Participant has a benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such Transferred Participant s benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan (the Transfer Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 If the Reverse Plan Spin-Off occurs after the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, such Transferred Participant shall continue to accrue service and benefits (if applicable) for the period until the Reverse Plan Spin-Off (unless the Transferred Participant s new position involves a change in status under the terms of the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable), such that the Transferred Participant s benefit under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan (as applicable) after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be the same as if the Reverse Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the applicable transfer of employment or hire. 
 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under this Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Supplementary Pension Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off.

Document 
 Exhibit 10(ee) 

General Electric Company 
 Annual Executive Incentive Plan 
 (As amended and restated effective January 1, 2023) 
 I. Purpose 
 The General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan (the Plan is an annual performance-based bonus plan that incentivizes and rewards eligible executive leaders of the Company for delivering on financial, operating and strategic goals of their business during a Plan Year. 
 II. Eligibility 
 The Company has the sole discretion to determine who is eligible to participate in the Plan. It is expected, however, that the following principles shall normally apply. 
 Eligibility shall generally be limited to employees who (i) are assigned to a job band at the Executive Band level or above in a participating country, (ii) are compensated through the Company s payroll and (iii) receive written notification of their eligibility from the Company. To remain eligible, employees must remain so employed for the entire Plan Year and through the date in the following year that awards are paid under the Plan (the Active Employment Requirement ). 
 In its sole discretion, the Company may waive the Active Employment Requirement in any case it deems appropriate, so long as the eligible employee remained so employed (as an eligible employee) for a minimum of three consecutive months during the Plan Year. For example, the Active Employment Requirement could be waived for otherwise eligible employees who 
 (1) are on an approved leave of absence during the Plan Year 
 (2) are newly hired or newly promoted into the Executive Band or higher positions before October 1 st of the Plan Year 
 (3) terminate employment during the Plan Year due to death, Disability, Retirement or involuntary termination without Cause or 
 (4) become ineligible to participate in the Plan during the Plan Year as the result of a transfer to a nonparticipating Affiliate or to an ineligible position. 
 Any awards made in connection with a waiver of the Active Employment Requirement shall be prorated as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. No proration shall apply for the period of any approved leave of absence. 
 An otherwise eligible employee who gives notice of his or her intention to resign or who participates in another Company-sponsored bonus or incentive plan (for the entire Plan Year) is ineligible to receive an award under this Plan. 
 Receipt of an award (including an award that is deferred) for one Plan Year does not create a right to an award for any other Plan Year. All awards (including the amounts thereof) are made at the sole discretion of the Company, regardless of the individual s, business s or Company s performance. 

III. Awards 
 The Company shall determine each eligible employee s award under the Plan as follows 
 Individual Target 
 Prior to or at the beginning of each Plan Year, each eligible employee s target award amount (the Individual Target is determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The Individual Target is based on the eligible employee s job band and is equal to a percentage of the eligible employee s base salary as of December 31 st of the Plan Year. Any Individual Target may be changed by the Company from time to time in its sole discretion. Being assigned an Individual Target does not guarantee that a bonus of any amount will be awarded. 
 Business Performance Target 
 At the beginning of each Plan Year, the financial, operating and strategic goals for each business (and Corporate as a business) are determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the General Electric Company Board of Directors (the MDCC ). Based on these performance goals, a threshold, target and maximum level of performance for each business is established by the MDCC, along with a related payout percentage. The MDCC then determines the weighting of these goals and payout percentages to set the Business Performance Target for each business. 
 Business Performance Factor 
 After the end of the Plan Year, the MDCC will assess each business s quantitative performance against its Business Performance Target and qualitative performance in risk management, compliance and other areas. In assessing overall business performance, the MDCC may (in its discretion) take into account the impact of external market conditions, corporate transaction activity and other considerations. This assessment is used by the MDCC to determine an overall percentage by which the Individual Target of each eligible employee within that business shall be adjusted (the Business Performance Factor ). 
 If an eligible employee has transferred employment from one Company business to another during a Plan Year (while remaining an eligible employee), his or her Business Performance Factor will be adjusted based on when such transfer occurs. If the transfer of employment occurs during the first quarter of a Plan Year, only the Business Performance Factor of the eligible employee s second business shall be used. Conversely, if the transfer of employment occurs during the last quarter of a Plan Year, only the Business Performance Factor of the first business shall be used. If the transfer of employment occurs during the second or third quarter of a Plan Year, the average Business Performance Factor of both businesses shall be used. 
 Individual Performance Factor 
 Finally, each eligible employee s people leader will determine (subject to approval by the MDCC) a further factor by which to adjust his or her Individual Target based on his or her individual and or team performance, leadership, risk management, compliance, integrity and other factors (the Individual Performance Factor ). These determinations 
 2 

may not permit the size of the business s bonus pool (the sum of Individual Targets for its eligible employees, as adjusted for the Business Performance Factor) to increase. 
 Other Adjustments 
 The Company retains complete discretion to further adjust the award amount for any individual for any reason (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, the MDCC shall retain any discretion that is not delegated as described in Section V). For example, the Company may modify award levels to address internal and external factors related to individual, business unit and Company performance and current and future projected business conditions, including factors such as internal parity, industry trends and market competitiveness, retention, dispute resolution and discipline. 
 Consistent with the purposes of the Plan, and due to the factors that will be taken into consideration, while the Company may determine a minimum aggregate payout amount during the Plan Year, individual awards amounts, if any, will vary from year to year and will not be determined before or during the Plan Year. 
 IV. Payment of Awards 
 Awards under the Plan will be reviewed and approved by the Company following the end of the Plan Year. All individual awards are subject to review by successively higher levels of senior management, and review and approval by the MDCC. 
 If not deferred, all approved awards will be paid as soon as practicable after such review, but in any event not later than March 15 of the year following the Plan Year (or such other date for participating countries outside of the United States as the Company may determine). Subject to Sections VIII and X, under no circumstances will an individual s award under the Plan be considered final unless and until after it is calculated, determined, and paid to the individual, and all other conditions are satisfied, including any terms and conditions applicable to deferred awards. Awards, net of any deferred amounts, will be issued via Company payroll (in the employee s local currency) and are subject to all applicable payroll deductions and tax withholdings. 
 V. Administration and Interpretation 
 The Plan shall be administered by the MDCC, who shall have the full power to construe and interpret the Plan in its sole discretion, including exercising any and all authority and responsibility given to the Company in this document (including the Appendix). 
 Without limiting the foregoing, the MDCC shall have the power to 
 (1) determine who is eligible to participate in the Plan 
 (2) determine whether to waive the Active Employment Requirement for any individual 
 (3) determine Individual Targets 
 (4) establish the performance goals for each business (including Corporate) and its Business Performance Target 
 (5) determine the Business Performance Factor for each business 
 3 

(6) adjust each business s Business Performance Target and or Business Performance Factor to reflect extraordinary or unusual events 
 (7) otherwise determine the amount of awards consistent with the terms of the Plan and 
 (8) establish or amend any rules or administrative procedures necessary or appropriate for Plan administration. 
 The MDCC may delegate its authority and responsibility under the Plan, except with respect to the determination of (i) awards for individuals as described in the charter of the MDCC and or (ii) the Business Performance Factor. Accordingly, the Chief Executive Officer CEO or the Chief Human Resources Officer CHRO ), or the delegatee of either, may exercise the MDCC s authority and responsibility under the Plan with respect to the determination of awards for other individuals (excluding the determination of the Business Performance Factor). 
 Nothing contained in the Plan shall be interpreted or construed as a promise of employment by the Company for the Plan Year, or any other time period, or a guarantee of payment of an award. 
 VI. Severability 
 The Plan (including any rules or administrative procedures established hereunder) represents the full and complete understanding between the Company and eligible employees with regard to terms of the Plan and any awards hereunder. The terms of the Plan (including any rules or administrative procedures) shall control in the event of inconsistencies with any other Company documents or any statements made by Company employees concerning the Plan. 
 If a final determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (or duly assigned arbitrator) that any provision contained in the Plan is unlawful, the Plan shall be considered amended in that instance to apply to such extent as the court arbitrator may determine to be enforceable, but only to the extent consistent with the original intent of the drafter. Alternatively, if such a court arbitrator finds that any provision contained in this Plan is unlawful -- and that provision cannot be amended, consistent with the original intent of the drafter, so as to make it lawful -- such finding shall not affect the effectiveness of any other provision of this Plan. 
 VII. Non-Assignability and Accounting 
 The right to any awards (including any deferred awards) or any other rights under the Plan, are not assignable in any manner whatsoever (except to the extent of beneficiary designations made pursuant to established administrative procedures). Any account created with respect to a deferred award shall be unfunded, unsecured and shall not constitute a trust for the benefit of any employee. No employee may create a lien or any other encumbrance on any present or future interest he or she may have under the Plan. 
 VIII. Additional Limitations (Clawbacks) 
 The Plan will be administered in compliance with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange or 
 4 

national securities association on which shares of the Company may be traded, and any Company policy adopted with respect to compensation recoupment, to the extent the application of such rules, regulations and or policies is permissible under applicable local law. This Section VIII will not be the Company s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters. 
 IX. Deferrals 
 Eligible employees who are employed within the United States may elect to defer awards that may be granted under the Plan. All deferred awards shall be administered in accordance with established administrative procedures, including procedures relating to election requirements, the manner in which deferred awards may be invested and the time and form in which they are distributed. Such procedures are described in the Appendix. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deferrals shall be permitted under this Plan or be effective with respect to the 2023 Plan Year or thereafter . 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the HealthCare Benefit Liabilities and Energy Benefit Liabilities (each as defined below) are transferred to the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan sponsored by GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) and the GE Energy Annual Executive Incentive Plan sponsored by Ropcor, Inc., respectively (each a Spin-Off Plan ), as described below (the Plan Spin-Off ). Each individual whose benefit is a HealthCare Benefit Liability or an Energy Benefit Liability is an Affected Transferee. 
 
 The HealthCare Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under this Plan for (i) active employees of GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s healthcare business GE HealthCare and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare business and certain former employees whose last employer of record within General Electric Company and its Affiliates is not attributable to any of General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare, or energy businesses (or is attributable to General Electric Company s aviation or energy businesses in limited cases), in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 
 The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities with respect to awards that have been deferred under this Plan prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date for (i) active employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s energy business GE Energy and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses may remain in the Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 5 

For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals with deferred awards under this Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date who also have a benefit in the GE Pension Plan or Supplementary Pension Plan at that time, their deferred awards under this Plan will be transferred to the corresponding Spin-Off Plan sponsored by the same entity that will be responsible for their pension benefit (or retained in this Plan accordingly). 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in this Plan , shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from this Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under this Plan (even if the Affected Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or its Affiliates, unless the Affected Transferee s benefit is transferred back to this Plan as described below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, active and former eligible employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s energy business may continue to participate in this Plan with respect awards which are not deferred for so long as such entities r emain Affiliates of General Electric Company . Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees shall become participants in the applicable Spin-Off Plan. Each Affected Transferee s status under the applicable Spin-Off Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the Affected Transferee s status under this Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each Affected Transferee s service with General Electric Company and its Affiliates credited under this Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under the applicable Spin-Off Plan and (ii) no Affected Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or corporate spin-off of GE HealthCare or GE Energy. 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Plan and its affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under such Spin-Off Plan and for all payment obligations thereunder. No individual whose benefits are transferred to a Spin-Off Plan shall have any claims or rights against General Electric Company in respect of benefits under this Plan. 
 Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if (1) an individual s employment is directly transferred from General Electric Company or its Affiliate (that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy) to an employer within GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when such employing entity is an Affiliate of General Electric Company or (2) an employee who left the service of General Electric Company and all of its Affiliates is subsequently hired by GE HealthCare or GE Energy , at a time when the employing entity is an Affiliate of General Electric Company, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from this Plan to the applicable Spin-Off Plan (each such transfer to a Spin-Off Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of General Electric Company on the Subsequent Spin-Off Date and (ii) the transferred benefits and liabilities for an individual that becomes employed within GE Energy shall be limited to deferred amounts.) 
 
 6 

Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with this Section IX and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as an Affected Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such Affected Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date.

Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Transfer Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of General Electric Company on the Transfer Date.) Such Transferred Participant shall resume participation in this Plan with respect to future awards immediately upon the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, unless the position in which the Transferred Participant becomes employed involves a change in status under the terms of the Plan. 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Plan and applicable law. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under the applicable Spin-Off Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under this Plan immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. 
 
 The liabilities of the applicable Spin-Off Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off for benefits accrued under (or transferred to) the Spin-Off Plan with respect to Transferred Participants before the Transfer Date shall become liabilities of this Plan immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. 
 X. Amendment & Termination

APPENDIX ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY ANNUAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN (Effective commencing with the 2018 Plan Year) 
 Section 1. HISTORY AND APPLICABILITY OF PRIOR RULES 
 Prior to 2011, incentive compensation was payable under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan. For 2011 through 2017, incentive compensation was payable pursuant to independent Company action, which included a prior iteration of the GE Annual Executive Incentive Plan for 2015 through 2017. 
 The rules associated with deferrals of allotments payable under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan (including participant election requirements, the manner in which deferred incentive compensation allotments may be invested and the time and form in which they are distributed) are reflected in the GE Incentive Compensation Plan document and various administrative procedures (collectively, the Prior Rules ). The Prior Rules include, but are not limited to, the Special Administrative Procedures for the GE Incentive Compensation Plan to Ensure Compliance with Code Section 409A (the Special Procedures ). 
 When the Company ceased awarding incentive compensation under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan and began awarding it pursuant to independent Company action, the Company, through the action of the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, specifically made the Prior Rules applicable to deferrals of allotments pursuant to independent Company action. 
 These procedures are effective with respect to all awards made under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan for the 2018 plan year and later. The Special Procedures (which are partially repeated below in Section 2) are also effective for all such awards. The Prior Rules continue to be effective for awards made for earlier years. 
 Section 2. DEFERRAL OF AWARDS 
 2.1. In General 
 A participant may elect to defer any award for which he or she is eligible. For this purpose, awards under the Plan shall be considered New Allotments under the Special Procedures. For convenience, certain rules in the Special Procedures applicable to New Allotments are repeated in the remainder of this Section 2. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deferrals shall be permitted under this Plan or be effective with respect to the 2023 Plan Year or thereafter. 
 2.2. Elections 
 Elections to defer awards (including elections under Subsection 2.3 as to the form in which such deferred awards will be paid) shall be made no later than the end of the year preceding the year for which the award is made, in accordance with established administrative procedures. All such elections shall be irrevocable. 

2.3. Available Forms 
 A participant may choose to receive a deferred award in a lump sum or in installments of either 10, 15 or 20 years. If no election as to the form of payment is made in accordance with established administrative procedures, payments shall be made in 10-year installments. 
 2.4. Commencement 
 Payment of deferred awards (including any interest or dividend equivalents allocable thereto) shall commence on April 1 of the year following Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as is practicable provided, however, that in the case of a Specified Employee, no payments shall be made during the first six months following Separation from Service. 
 2.5. Re-employment 
 Any re-employment after Separation from Service shall be disregarded in determining whether deferred awards commence to be paid (or continue to be paid). 
 2.6. Death 
 If a participant dies before all payments of a deferred award have been made, payments shall continue to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at the same time and in the same form as if the participant had lived. 
 2.7. Compliance with Code Section 409A 
 The rules in this Section 2 are intended to ensure that the Plan complies with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and applicable guidance thereunder, and the Plan shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. 
 Without limiting the foregoing 
 (a) The rules in this Section 2 override anything to the contrary either in the Plan, any other administrative procedures or the communications and election materials provided to participants in the course of administering the Plan. 
 (b) Under no circumstances shall a scheduled payment of a deferred award be accelerated, nor shall a subsequent deferral be permitted with respect to such amounts. 
 2.8. Definitions 
 For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the designated meanings 
 Company means General Electric Company. 
 Separation from Service means a participant s termination of employment with the Company and all Affiliates (defined for this purpose as any company or business entity in which the Company has a 50 or more interest whether or not a participating employer in the Plan) provided that Separation from Service for purposes of the Plan shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. 

Specified Employee means a specified employee as described in the Company s Procedures for Determining Specified Employees under Code Section 409A, as amended from time to time. 
 Section 3. ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED AWARDS 
 3.1. In General 
 At the participant s election, deferred awards will be accounted for in one or more of the following three media cash, Standard and Poor s 500 Index S&P 500 Units or GE common stock Stock Units, or such additional media as described below. 
 3.2. Cash 
 The portion of any award accounted for in cash shall be credited with interest daily based upon the prior calendar month s average yield for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds with maturities of from ten to twenty years. 
 3.3. S&P 500 Units 
 The number of S&P 500 Units credited to a participant s account with respect to any deferral will be determined by dividing (1) the average closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s during the measurement period by (2) the dollar amount of the deferral to be accounted for in S&P 500 Units. The measurement period will be the 20 trading days ending on the date the Company approves awards under the Plan for the year (and including that date if it is a trading date). 
 Each portion of an account hypothetically invested in S&P 500 Units will be credited quarterly, on GE s dividend record date for the quarter, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional S&P 500 Units) based upon the consecutive prior calendar quarter s quarterly dividend as reported by Standard and Poor s. 
 3.4. Stock Units 
 The number of Stock Units credited to a participant s account with respect to any deferral will be determined by dividing (1) the average New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock during the measurement period by (2) the dollar amount of the deferral to be accounted for in Stock Units. The measurement period will be the 20 trading days ending on the date the Company approves awards under the Plan for the year (and including that date if it is a trading date). 
 Each portion of an account hypothetically invested in Stock Units will be credited quarterly, on GE s dividend record date for the quarter, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional Stock Units) based on the dividend declared on GE common stock for such quarter. 
 Effective as of the spin-off of GE HealthCare as an independent public company (the Spin-Off ), any accounts credited with Stock Units shall be credited with an additional number of shares of GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) common stock GE HealthCare Stock Units equal to (i) the number of Stock Units credited to such account as of the Spin-Off, multiplied by (ii) the distribution ratio used to determine the number of shares of GE HealthCare Stock per each share of GE common stock received by record holders of GE common stock upon the Spin-Off. Any dividends of GE HealthCare Stock 

will be credited, as applicable, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional GE HealthCare Stock Units) on the dividend record date. 
 At the one year anniversary of the Spin-Off, no notional investments in GE HealthCare Stock Units will continue to be permitted under this Plan, and any hypothetical investments remaining in GE HealthCare Stock Units will be automatically converted into a hypothetical cash investment as described in Section 3.2, as if such conversion were a switch as described in Section 3.5, until such time that a participant (or beneficiary) makes a switch as described in Section 3.5 or payment is made as described in Section 3.6. 
 If there is any change in the common stock represented by any deferred award or associated dividend equivalents previously credited, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, share distribution in the nature of a stock dividend, or other change in corporate structure, appropriate adjustments shall be made, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, to the shares of common stock represented by such deferred allotments or dividend equivalents. 
 3.5. Switching 
 Participants (and beneficiaries) may elect four times each calendar year to switch the media in which their accounts are hypothetically invested. Switches will be valued based on (1) the date they are properly effectuated in accordance with administrative procedures, and (2) the applicable New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock (or the applicable exchange closing price of GE HealthCare Stock, if applicable) and or the closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s. 
 A switch must involve at least 25 of a participant s account balance. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) prior to the Spin-Off, participants may elect to switch their hypothetical investment of Stock Units into a different media permitted under this Plan, even if such participant has already made four elections for the Plan Year and the switch would impact less than 25 of such participant s account balance, and (ii) following the Spin-Off, participants shall not be permitted to switch the hypothetical investment of their account into GE HealthCare Stock Units. 
 3.6. Payments 
 All payments of deferred awards (including any interest or dividend equivalents allocable thereto) will be made in cash. 
 For purposes of making payments, the portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in S&P 500 Units will be valued based on the average closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year the payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). 
 Similarly, the portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in Stock Units will be valued based on the average New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year a payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). The portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in GE HealthCare Stock Units will be valued based on the average closing price of such GE HealthCare Stock on the 

applicable stock exchange during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year a payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). 
 Section 4. GENERAL CONDITIONS 
 4.1. Creditable Compensation 
 Awards under the Plan shall be taken into account as creditable pay under the Company benefit plans to the same extent and in the same manner that they would have been had they been paid under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan, or pursuant to independent Company action. 
 4.2. Additional Rules 
 The Company has the sole discretion to interpret and apply these procedures and may apply other rules and procedures as it deems necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, rules for making deferral elections, valuing and crediting deferrals, valuing and crediting dividend equivalents, valuing and making switches, defining applicable measuring periods, determining closing prices and closing index values and determining what days constitute trading days. Such rules may or may not be communicated to participants, may or may not be reflected in formal administrative procedures, and may change from year to year. However, no rules or procedures may be applied that would cause a failure to comply with Code Section 409A.

The Plan was established as of January 1, 2021. Effective January 1, 2023, the Plan is amended and restated as set forth herein. The Plan shall be interpreted and administered consistently with the intent to be a top hat plan that is not subject to various provisions of ERISA. 
 The purpose of the Plan is to provide supplemental benefits that could have been payable under the GE Retirement Savings Plan (the RSP if not for limits imposed by the Code. The Plan provides company credits adjusted for deemed investment gains and losses. 
 Section II. Eligibility 
 An individual is eligible to participate in the Plan only if the individual is an Eligible Employee. To become an Eligible Employee during 2021 or a subsequent calendar year, an individual must be an Employee who is eligible to make and receive contributions under the RSP and is 
 (a) a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201(2) and 301(a)(3) of ERISA 
 (b) a salaried employee, as determined by the Plan Sponsor 
 (c) assigned by GE to the GE executive or higher career band, or have Earnings for the immediately preceding calendar year which exceeded the Section 401(a)(17) Limit for such preceding calendar year 1 and

 Once an individual is (or has been) an Eligible Employee, the requirement of provision (c) of this Section II is waived with respect to such individual until such individual s termination of employment with the Company (including all Affiliates). If a once-Eligible Employee is reemployed, the individual must meet all requirements of this Section II, 
 
 1 For the 2021 calendar year only, 2019 and 2020 each counted as the immediately preceding calendar year for purposes of this provision, such that an Employee whose Earnings for 2019 were in excess of the 401(a)(17) limit for 2019, or whose Earnings for 2020 were in excess of the 401(a)(17) limit for 2020, qualified under this provision. 

including provision (c), following reemployment in order to again become an Eligible Employee. 
 Section III. Company Credit 
 An Eligible Employee shall accrue a credit (the Company Credit for a calendar year if the Eligible Employee 
 (a) is eligible to receive a Company Retirement Contribution for such calendar year under the RSP and has Eligible Earnings for such calendar year and 
 (b) remains employed by the Company continuously from January 1st (or, if later, the date the individual became an Eligible Employee) through December 15th of such calendar year, unless the individual terminates employment with the Company during such calendar year due to one of the following reasons (or after having attained age 65) 
 (i) death 
 (ii) a determination that the Employee is disabled under Section VIII E 2 of the RSP 
 (iii) a layoff entitling the individual to severance benefits under the GE Layoff Benefit Plan for Salaried Employees or the GE Layoff Benefit Plan for Certain GE Affiliates, or an employer-initiated separation that is not for cause entitling the individual to severance benefits under the GE US Executive Severance Plan (or any mirror of such plans maintained by GE s energy business) or 
 (iv) transfer directly to a Successor Employer in connection with a Business Disposition. For the avoidance of doubt, this subparagraph (iv) does not apply if all Plan liabilities with respect to the Employee are transferred to a spin-off plan maintained by such Successor Employer or an affiliate thereof. 
 An Eligible Employee s Company Credit for each calendar year shall equal 7 of Eligible Earnings paid to such individual during such calendar year while the individual is an Eligible Employee. Such Company Credit shall be added to the Eligible Employee s Account by January 31st of the next following calendar year, as determined by the Plan Administrator. No adjustment shall be made for deemed investment gains or losses with respect to any period before the Company Credit is added to the Account. 
 Section IV. Investment Credits 
 Each Participant s Account shall be adjusted daily, or at such other frequency determined by the Plan Administrator that is at least annually, to reflect deemed investment gains and losses, based on the Participant s investment election for the Participant s Account. 
 A Participant s investment election shall be made in 1 increments (between 1 and 100 among the available hypothetical investment options under the Plan, in the form 
 2 

and during the period prescribed by the Plan Administrator, and shall apply uniformly to any future Company Credits. Once processed, the Participant s investment election shall become effective and continue to be effective until the Participant completes a new investment election in accordance with this paragraph or the Participant s Account is distributed. 
 A Participant may also elect to switch the deemed investment of the Participant s Account balance, in the form prescribed by the Plan Administrator, whereby 
 (a) 1 , or any multiple thereof (up to 100 ), of the aggregate notional investment in one hypothetical investment option is switched to a notional investment in another hypothetical investment option or 
 (b) the deemed investment of the Participant s Account balance is reallocated among one or more hypothetical investment options in such whole percentage(s) (between 1 and 100 as the Participant may designate. 
 The Participant may elect to make up to twelve such deemed investment switches per calendar quarter. The Participant may elect, in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator, to have the deemed investment of the Participant s Account automatically rebalanced on a periodic basis as designated by the Participant, and each such periodic rebalancing shall count as a deemed investment switch when applying the twelve per calendar quarter limit. In addition, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant s deemed investment switches shall be subject to such additional restrictions as may be established from time to time by the Plan Administrator in order to limit excessive, short-term, round-trip and other deemed investment switching practices by Participants. 
 The deemed investment alternatives which a Participant may elect for the deemed investment of the Participant s Account shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in its discretion and may include an alternative based on the performance of Company stock. If there is any change in the Company stock, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, share distribution in the nature of a stock dividend, or other change in corporate structure, appropriate adjustments shall be made, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, in the number of shares of Company stock represented by such alternative. The Plan Administrator may change or eliminate one or more deemed investment alternatives at any time, in its sole discretion, and shall have the discretion to reallocate balances if one or more deemed investment alternatives are eliminated. 
 With respect to any particular Company Credit, in the absence of a valid investment election by the deadline established by the Plan Administrator, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected a default deemed investment alternative designated by the Plan Administrator. 
 All benefits under the Plan are subject to the risk of loss (reduction of Account balance) due to the performance of the deemed investment alternative. No Participant or Beneficiary shall have a right to any adjustment to make up for investment results (whether a loss, gain that could have been greater or otherwise), and without regard to the cause of the investment result (whether by default, affirmative election of the Participant or Beneficiary, a decision of the Plan Administrator or otherwise).

Section V. Vesting 
 A Participant shall vest in the Participant s Account upon being credited with three years of RSP Service, or if earlier, upon 
 (a) attaining age 65 while employed by the Company or 
 (b) ceasing to be an Employee as the result of transferring directly to a Successor Employer in connection with a Business Disposition (consistent with the principles for vesting under such circumstances set forth in the RSP). For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph (b) does not apply if all Plan liabilities with respect to the Employee are transferred to a spin-off plan maintained by such Successor Employer or an affiliate thereof. 
 A Participant s Account that is not vested at the time of the Participant s Separation From Service shall be forfeited and is not subject to reinstatement under any circumstances. 
 Section VI. Payments to Participants 
 Upon a Participant s Separation From Service and subject to Section X, the Participant s Account shall be valued as of the close of trading on July 15th of the calendar year next following the Participant s Separation From Service (or if the New York Stock Exchange is not open for trading on such day, the next following day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading) and paid to the Participant in a cash lump sum by July 31st of such calendar year. 
 For purposes of the Plan, a payment that is made after the date prescribed by the Plan shall be treated as being made on time if made by the later of (a) the last day of the calendar year in which the prescribed payment date occurs or (b) the 15th day of the third calendar month that starts after the prescribed payment date. 
 Section VII. Payments Following Death 
 If a Participant dies before the Participant s Account has been paid, the Account shall be paid to the Participant s Beneficiary in a cash lump sum. The payment date shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and shall be no later than December 31st of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the Participant s death occurs. 
 A Participant may designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive the balance of the Participant s Account after the Participant s death, in writing on a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator. The Participant may change the Participant s designation of a Beneficiary at any time before the Participant s death. If a Participant s Account is community property, any designation of a Beneficiary shall be valid or effective only as permitted under applicable law. Any valid Beneficiary designation, and any valid change in a previous Beneficiary designation, shall become effective as of its date only once the Plan Administrator receives and accepts the Beneficiary designation form in accordance with administrative procedures, and no designation dated after the Participant s death shall be accepted. The most recent valid Beneficiary designation in effect at the time of the Participant s death shall apply. 
 4 

In the absence of an effective Beneficiary designation under the Plan, or if all persons so designated have predeceased the Participant, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be the Participant s designated beneficiary under the RSP or, if none, the Participant s estate. 
 If a Participant s Beneficiary is a minor, a person who has been declared incompetent, or a person incapable of handling the disposition of the person s property, the balance of the Participant s Account may be paid to the guardian, legal representative, or person having the care and custody of such Beneficiary.

 The remedy under this subsection (c) is not exclusive and shall not limit any right of the Company under applicable law, including (but not limited to) a remedy under (i) Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange or national securities association on which shares of the Company may be traded, and or (iii) any Company policy adopted with respect to compensation recoupment. 
 8 

(d) If the Company determines that a Participant is indebted to it on the effective date of the Separation From Service, including by reason of breaching a commitment to the Company, the Company reserves the right to offset the payment of any benefits under the Plan by the amount of such indebtedness, as determined by the Plan Administrator. Such offset will be made in accordance with all applicable laws (including the intent not to trigger taxes under Section 409A of the Code). 
 (e) No amount payable at any time under this Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or encumbrance of any kind (except as described in subsection (d) above). Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, commute, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey any such benefit, whether presently or subsequently payable, shall be void. Except as required by law or as described in Section X, no benefit payable under this Plan shall, prior to actual payment, in any manner be subject to seizure, garnishment, attachment, execution, sequestration or other legal process for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony, separate maintenance or liability of any Participant or Beneficiary, or be transferrable by operation of law in the event of a Participant s or any other person s bankruptcy or insolvency.

 (j) This Plan contains a complete statement of its terms. The Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated only in writing and then only as provided in Section XI. The legal or equitable rights or interests of any person in this Plan, and the Participating Employer s obligations or liabilities therefor, shall be exclusively determined by the express provisions of the Plan. 
 (k) If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the unlawfulness, invalidity, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of the Plan, each of which shall remain in full force and effect.

(l) Each reference in the Plan to a written document or delivery of a communication in writing shall include delivery by electronic means e.g. , by email or posting on an applicable website). 
 Section X. Taxation and Compliance with Section 409A of the Code 
 (a) All payments and benefits under the Plan are subject to all applicable deductions and withholdings, including obligations to withhold federal, state, and local income and employment taxes. Each recipient of benefits under the Plan (and not the Company) shall be solely responsible for the recipient s own tax liability with respect to such benefits (including imputed income), without regard to the amount withheld or reported to the Internal Revenue Service. 
 (b) The amount withheld shall be determined by the Company. The Company may deduct from other wages payable to the Participant any employment tax that the Company reasonably determines to be due with respect to the benefit under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or require the Participant or Beneficiary to remit to the Company or its designee an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax. Alternatively, the Company, in its discretion, may deduct such FICA amounts (plus an amount to cover associated federal and state income taxes) from the unpaid portion of a Participant s benefit, in a manner consistent with Treasury Department regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vi). 
 (c) The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted accordingly. To the extent that a provision of this Plan does not comply with Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be void and without effect. The Company does not warrant that the Plan will comply with Section 409A of the Code with respect to any Participant or with respect to any payment. In no event shall the Company (or any director, officer, employee, or affiliate thereof) be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty incurred by a recipient of benefits under the Plan as a result of the Plan s failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or any other requirements of applicable tax laws. 
 Section XI. Amendment or Termination 
 The Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors of GE or its designee, at any time and for any reason, in its sole discretion and with the result that benefits under the Plan may be changed or discontinued, retroactively or prospectively. 
 Termination of the Plan shall be a payment event, and payments shall be made only to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code. All payments related to termination of the Plan (to the extent permitted) shall be made at a time determined by the Plan Sponsor in its sole discretion, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. If the Plan Sponsor or the Plan Administrator determines that any provision of the Plan is or might be inconsistent with the restrictions imposed by Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed to be amended to the extent that the Plan Sponsor or the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to bring it into compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Any such deemed amendment shall be effective as of the earliest date such amendment is necessary under Section 409A of the Code. 
 10 

Section XII. Unfunded Plan 
 Benefits provided under this Plan are unfunded and unsecured obligations of the Participating Employer payable from its general assets. Participant Accounts, deemed investments, and all credits and other adjustments under the Plan are for measuring purposes only and do not correspond to actual investments or otherwise signify an individual account or funded benefits. 
 Nothing contained in this Plan shall require a Participating Employer to segregate any monies from its general funds, to create any trust or other funding vehicle, to make any special deposits, or to purchase any policies of insurance with respect to such obligations. If a Participating Employer elects to take any such action, such assets, investments and the proceeds therefrom shall at all times remain the sole property of the Participating Employer and subject to its creditors. To the extent the Participating Employer pursues individual insurance policies on one or more Participants to fund its obligations, such Participants shall provide any information as may be required by the insurance company for such purpose. No Participant, Beneficiary, or other individual shall have any economic interest or similar rights under the Plan or any ownership rights in such assets, investments or proceeds, whether by reason of being a named insured or otherwise. 
 Section XIII. Administration 
 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the management and control of the operation and administration of the Plan shall be vested in the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator has sole discretion to make all determinations with respect to eligibility and benefits under the Plan and such determinations shall be final and binding. The Plan Administrator shall act in good faith, but shall not be subject to the requirements of Title I, Part 4 of ERISA. 
 No liability shall attach to or be incurred by the stockholders, officers, directors or employees of the Company, in whatever capacity, under or by reason of the terms, conditions or agreements contained in the Plan or any law, rule or regulation, or for acts or decisions taken or omitted by any of them thereunder. 
 The Plan Administrator may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit. In accordance with its charter, the Plan Administrator may also delegate to other persons or other entities any or all of its authority, responsibilities, obligations and duties with respect to the Plan. If the Company, Plan Administrator or other plan fiduciary (an Advisee engages attorneys, accountants, actuaries, consultants, and other service providers (an Advisor to advise them on issues related to a Plan or the Advisee s responsibilities under the Plan 
 (a) The Advisor s client is the Advisee and not any employee, participant, dependent, beneficiary, claimant, or other person 
 (b) The Advisee will be entitled to preserve the attorney-client privilege and any other privilege accorded to communications with the Advisor, and all other rights to maintain confidentiality, to the full extent permitted by law and 
 11 

(c) No employee, participant, dependent, beneficiary, claimant or other person will be permitted to review any communication between the Advisee and any of its or his Advisors with respect to whom a privilege applies, unless mandated by a court order. 
 Section XIV. Claims and Appeals 
 The provisions of this Section XIV shall apply to any claim for a benefit under the Plan, regardless of the basis asserted for the claim and regardless of when the act or omission upon which the claim is based occurred. Any such claim shall be addressed through the claims and appeals process described in the handbook summary for this Plan, and no such claim may be filed in court, arbitration, or similar proceeding before the claimant has exhausted that process. Such process is intended to comply with Section 503 of ERISA and shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. 
 The claims administrator shall be the GE Pension Board, a committee whose members are appointed by the Board of Directors, or its designee or delegate. 
 Section XV. Limitations Period 
 (a) Any claim (i) for benefits (ii) to enforce rights under the Plan or (iii) otherwise seeking a remedy or judgment of any kind against the Plan, the Plan Administrator or the Company must be filed within the limitations period prescribed by this Section XV (and subsequent to exhaustion as described in Section XIV). 
 (b) The limitations period shall begin on the following date 
 (i) For a claim for benefits, the earliest of (1) the date the first benefit payment was actually made or allegedly due, or (2) the date the Plan, the Plan Administrator or the Company first repudiated the alleged obligation to provide such benefits, regardless of whether such repudiation occurred during administrative review pursuant to Section XIV. A repudiation described in clause (2) may be made in the form of a direct communication to the employee or a more general oral or written communication related to benefits payable under the Plan (for example, a summary of the Plan or an amendment to the Plan) 
 (ii) For a claim to enforce an alleged right under the Plan (other than a right to benefits), the date the Plan first denied the request made on behalf of the employee to exercise such right, regardless of whether such denial occurred during administrative review pursuant to Section XIV or 
 (iii) For any claim otherwise seeking a remedy or judgment of any kind against the Plan, the Plan Administrator or the Company, the earliest date on which the employee knew or should have known of the material facts on which such claim or action is based, regardless of whether the employee was aware of the legal theory underlying the claim. 
 12 

(c) The limitations period shall end on the first anniversary of the beginning date described in Section XV(b) provided, however, that if a request for administrative review pursuant to Section XIV is pending at such time, the limitations period shall be extended to end on the date that is 60 days after the final denial of such claim on administrative review. 
 (d) The limitations period described in this Section XV replaces and supersedes any limitations period that otherwise might be deemed applicable under state or federal law in the absence of this Section XV. A claim filed after the expiration of the limitations period shall be deemed time-barred, except that the Plan Administrator shall have discretion to extend the limitations period upon a showing of exceptional circumstances that, in the opinion of the Plan Administrator, provide good cause for an extension. The exercise of this discretion is committed solely to the Plan Administrator and is not subject to review. 
 (e) In the event of any claim brought by or on behalf of two or more employees, the requirements of this Section XV shall apply separately with respect to each employee.

 Section II. Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities

Document 
 Exhibit 10(ff) 

 GE Energy Annual Executive Incentive Plan 
 (Effective as of January 1, 2023) 
 I. Purpose 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the Energy Benefit Liabilities (as defined below) are transferred to this GE Energy Annual Executive Incentive Plan (the Plan ), as described below (the Plan Spin-Off ). The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities with respect to awards that have been deferred under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan for (i) active employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s energy business GE Energy and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. The participants transferred to this Plan are the GE Energy Transferees. 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of GE Energy may remain in the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan or be transferred to the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals with deferred awards under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date who also have a benefit in the GE Pension Plan or Supplementary Pension Plan at that time, their deferred awards under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan will be transferred to this Plan only if a GE Energy entity will be responsible for their pension benefit. 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the GE Energy Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan , shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan (even if the GE Energy Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or its Affiliates, unless the GE Energy Transferee s benefit is transferred back to the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan as described below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, active and former eligible employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s energy business may continue to participate in the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan in accordance with its terms with respect awards which are not deferred. 
 Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, this Plan assumes the Energy Benefit Liabilities as a continuation of the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan and each GE Energy Transferee is a participant in this Plan. Each GE Energy Transferee s status under this Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the GE Energy Transferee s status under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each GE Energy Transferee s service with General Electric Company and its Affiliates credited under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan 

immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under this Plan and (ii) no GE Energy Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or corporate spin-off of General Electric Company s healthcare business or GE Energy. 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under this Plan and for all payment obligations hereunder. 
 Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date but prior to the corporate spin-off of General Electric Company s energy business as an independent public company (the GE Energy Spin-Off , if (1) an individual s employment is directly transferred to GE Energy from an employer within General Electric Company and its Affiliates (that is not part of GE Energy) or (2) an employee who left the service of General Electric Company and all of its Affiliates is subsequently hired by GE Energy, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan (or, if applicable, the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan) to this Plan (each such transfer to this Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of Ropcor, Inc. on the Subsequent Spin-Off Date.) 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with this Section I and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as a GE Energy Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such GE Energy Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date. 
 Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date but prior to the GE Energy Spin-Off, if an individual with an accrued benefit under this Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an employer within General Electric Company and its Affiliates (that is not part of GE Energy) or (2) is hired by General Electric Company or its Affiliate (that is not part of GE Energy) (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from this Plan to the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan (or, if applicable, the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan) (each such transfer from this Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Transfer Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of Ropcor, Inc. on the Transfer Date.) Such Transferred Participant shall resume participation in the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan (or, if applicable, the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan) with respect to future awards immediately upon the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, unless the position in which the Transferred Participant becomes employed involves a change in status under the terms of such plan. 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Plan and applicable law. The accrued benefit of the Transferred 
 2 

Participant under this Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan or the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. 
 The liabilities under this Plan before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off for benefits accrued under (or transferred to) the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan or the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan, as applicable, with respect to Transferred Participants before the Transfer Date shall become liabilities under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan or the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. No individual whose benefits are transferred from this Plan to the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan or the GE HealthCare Annual Executive Incentive Plan shall have any claims or rights against GE Energy in respect of benefits under this Plan. 
 Because this Plan is a continuation of the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan for deferred awards of GE Energy Transferees, this document includes the provisions of the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan that applied before January 1, 2023. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no further awards shall be issued under this Plan after the Effective Date. 
 II. Eligibility 
 The Company has the sole discretion to determine who is eligible to participate in the Plan. It is expected, however, that the following principles shall normally apply. 
 Eligibility shall generally be limited to employees who (i) are assigned to a job band at the Executive Band level or above in a participating country, (ii) are compensated through the Company s payroll and (iii) receive written notification of their eligibility from the Company. To remain eligible, employees must remain so employed for the entire Plan Year and through the date in the following year that awards are paid under the Plan (the Active Employment Requirement ). 
 In its sole discretion, the Company may waive the Active Employment Requirement in any case it deems appropriate, so long as the eligible employee remained so employed (as an eligible employee) for a minimum of three consecutive months during the Plan Year. For example, the Active Employment Requirement could be waived for otherwise eligible employees who 
 (1) are on an approved leave of absence during the Plan Year 
 (2) are newly hired or newly promoted into the Executive Band or higher positions before October 1 st of the Plan Year 
 (3) terminate employment during the Plan Year due to death, Disability, Retirement or involuntary termination without Cause or 
 (4) become ineligible to participate in the Plan during the Plan Year as the result of a transfer to a nonparticipating Affiliate or to an ineligible position. 
 Any awards made in connection with a waiver of the Active Employment Requirement shall be prorated as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. No proration shall apply for the period of any approved leave of absence. 
 3 

An otherwise eligible employee who gives notice of his or her intention to resign or who participates in another Company-sponsored bonus or incentive plan (for the entire Plan Year) is ineligible to receive an award under this Plan. 
 Receipt of an award (including an award that is deferred) for one Plan Year does not create a right to an award for any other Plan Year. All awards (including the amounts thereof) are made at the sole discretion of the Company, regardless of the individual s, business s or Company s performance. 
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no awards shall be granted under the Plan on and after the Effective Date . 
 III. Awards 
 The Company shall determine each eligible employee s award under the Plan as follows 
 Individual Target 
 Prior to or at the beginning of each Plan Year, each eligible employee s target award amount (the Individual Target is determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The Individual Target is based on the eligible employee s job band and is equal to a percentage of the eligible employee s base salary as of December 31 st of the Plan Year. Any Individual Target may be changed by the Company from time to time in its sole discretion. Being assigned an Individual Target does not guarantee that a bonus of any amount will be awarded. 
 Business Performance Target 
 At the beginning of each Plan Year, the financial, operating and strategic goals for each business (and Corporate as a business) are determined by the compensation committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee ). Based on these performance goals, a threshold, target and maximum level of performance for each business is established by the Compensation Committee, along with a related payout percentage. The Compensation Committee then determines the weighting of these goals and payout percentages to set the Business Performance Target for each business. 
 Business Performance Factor 
 After the end of the Plan Year, the Compensation Committee will assess each business s quantitative performance against its Business Performance Target and qualitative performance in risk management, compliance and other areas. In assessing overall business performance, the Compensation Committee may (in its discretion) take into account the impact of external market conditions, corporate transaction activity and other considerations. This assessment is used by the Compensation Committee to determine an overall percentage by which the Individual Target of each eligible employee within that business shall be adjusted (the Business Performance Factor ). 
 If an eligible employee has transferred employment from one Company business to another during a Plan Year (while remaining an eligible employee), his or her Business Performance Factor will be adjusted based on when such transfer occurs. If the transfer of employment occurs during the first quarter of a Plan Year, only the Business Performance Factor of the eligible employee s second business shall be used. 
 4 

Conversely, if the transfer of employment occurs during the last quarter of a Plan Year, only the Business Performance Factor of the first business shall be used. If the transfer of employment occurs during the second or third quarter of a Plan Year, the average Business Performance Factor of both businesses shall be used. 
 Individual Performance Factor 
 Finally, each eligible employee s people leader will determine (subject to approval by the Compensation Committee) a further factor by which to adjust his or her Individual Target based on his or her individual and or team performance, leadership, risk management, compliance, integrity and other factors (the Individual Performance Factor ). These determinations may not permit the size of the business s bonus pool (the sum of Individual Targets for its eligible employees, as adjusted for the Business Performance Factor) to increase. 
 Other Adjustments 
 The Company retains complete discretion to further adjust the award amount for any individual for any reason (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Compensation Committee shall retain any discretion that is not delegated as described in Section V). For example, the Company may modify award levels to address internal and external factors related to individual, business unit and Company performance and current and future projected business conditions, including factors such as internal parity, industry trends and market competitiveness, retention, dispute resolution and discipline. 
 Consistent with the purposes of the Plan, and due to the factors that will be taken into consideration, while the Company may determine a minimum aggregate payout amount during the Plan Year, individual awards amounts, if any, will vary from year to year and will not be determined before or during the Plan Year. 
 IV. Payment of Awards 
 Awards under the Plan will be reviewed and approved by the Company following the end of the Plan Year. All individual awards are subject to review by successively higher levels of senior management, and review and approval by the Compensation Committee. 
 If not deferred, all approved awards will be paid as soon as practicable after such review, but in any event not later than March 15 of the year following the Plan Year (or such other date for participating countries outside of the United States as the Company may determine). Subject to Sections VIII and X, under no circumstances will an individual s award under the Plan be considered final unless and until after it is calculated, determined, and paid to the individual, and all other conditions are satisfied, including any terms and conditions applicable to deferred awards. Awards, net of any deferred amounts, will be issued via Company payroll (in the employee s local currency) and are subject to all applicable payroll deductions and tax withholdings. 
 V. Administration and Interpretation 
 The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee, who shall have the full power to construe and interpret the Plan in its sole discretion, including exercising any and all authority and responsibility given to the Company in this document (including the Appendix). 
 5 

Without limiting the foregoing, the Compensation Committee shall have the power to 
 (1) determine who is eligible to participate in the Plan 
 (2) determine whether to waive the Active Employment Requirement for any individual 
 (3) determine Individual Targets 
 (4) establish the performance goals for each business (including Corporate) and its Business Performance Target 
 (5) determine the Business Performance Factor for each business 
 (6) adjust each business s Business Performance Target and or Business Performance Factor to reflect extraordinary or unusual events 
 (7) otherwise determine the amount of awards consistent with the terms of the Plan and 
 (8) establish or amend any rules or administrative procedures necessary or appropriate for Plan administration. 
 The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority and responsibility under the Plan, except with respect to the determination of (i) awards for individuals as described in the charter of the Compensation Committee and or (ii) the Business Performance Factor. Accordingly, the Chief Executive Officer CEO or the Chief Human Resources Officer CHRO ), or the delegatee of either, may exercise the Compensation Committee s authority and responsibility under the Plan with respect to the determination of awards for other individuals (excluding the determination of the Business Performance Factor). 
 Nothing contained in the Plan shall be interpreted or construed as a promise of employment by the Company for the Plan Year, or any other time period, or a guarantee of payment of an award. 
 VI. Severability 
 The Plan (including any rules or administrative procedures established hereunder) represents the full and complete understanding between the Company and eligible employees with regard to terms of the Plan and any awards hereunder.

APPENDIX ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE GE ENERGY ANNUAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN (Effective commencing with the 2018 Plan Year) 
 As described in Section I of the Plan, the Plan is a continuation of the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan for GE Energy Transferees. The administrative procedures set forth in this Appendix are applicable to the amounts deferred under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan by GE Energy Transferees , and all deferrals and all other benefits accrued by GE Energy Transferees under the General Electric Company Annual Executive Incentive Plan are assumed by Ropcor, Inc. and shall continue under the terms of the Plan and this Appendix. 
 Section 1. HISTORY AND APPLICABILITY OF PRIOR RULES 
 Prior to 2011, incentive compensation was payable under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan. For 2011 through 2017, incentive compensation was payable pursuant to independent Company action, which included a prior iteration of the GE Annual Executive Incentive Plan for 2015 through 2017. 
 The rules associated with deferrals of allotments payable under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan (including participant election requirements, the manner in which deferred incentive compensation allotments may be invested and the time and form in which they are distributed) are reflected in the GE Incentive Compensation Plan document and various administrative procedures (collectively, the Prior Rules ). The Prior Rules include, but are not limited to, the Special Administrative Procedures for the GE Incentive Compensation Plan to Ensure Compliance with Code Section 409A (the Special Procedures ). 
 When the Company ceased awarding incentive compensation under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan and began awarding it pursuant to independent Company action, the Company, through the action of the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, specifically made the Prior Rules applicable to deferrals of allotments pursuant to independent Company action. 
 These procedures are effective with respect to all awards made under the Annual Executive Incentive Plan for the 2018 plan year and later. The Special Procedures (which are partially repeated below in Section 2) are also effective for all such awards. The Prior Rules continue to be effective for awards made for earlier years. 
 Section 2. DEFERRAL OF AWARDS 
 2.1. In General 
 A participant may elect to defer any award for which he or she is eligible. For this purpose, awards under the Plan shall be considered New Allotments under the Special Procedures. For convenience, certain rules in the Special Procedures applicable to New Allotments are repeated in the remainder of this Section 2. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deferrals shall be permitted under this Plan or be effective with respect to the 2023 Plan Year or thereafter. 

2.2. Elections 
 Elections to defer awards (including elections under Subsection 2.3 as to the form in which such deferred awards will be paid) shall be made no later than the end of the year preceding the year for which the award is made, in accordance with established administrative procedures. All such elections shall be irrevocable. 
 2.3. Available Forms 
 A participant may choose to receive a deferred award in a lump sum or in installments of either 10, 15 or 20 years. If no election as to the form of payment is made in accordance with established administrative procedures, payments shall be made in 10-year installments. 
 2.4. Commencement 
 Payment of deferred awards (including any interest or dividend equivalents allocable thereto) shall commence on April 1 of the year following Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as is practicable provided, however, that in the case of a Specified Employee, no payments shall be made during the first six months following Separation from Service. 
 2.5. Re-employment 
 Any re-employment after Separation from Service shall be disregarded in determining whether deferred awards commence to be paid (or continue to be paid). 
 2.6. Death 
 If a participant dies before all payments of a deferred award have been made, payments shall continue to the beneficiary or beneficiaries at the same time and in the same form as if the participant had lived. 
 2.7. Compliance with Code Section 409A 
 The rules in this Section 2 are intended to ensure that the Plan complies with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and applicable guidance thereunder, and the Plan shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. 
 Without limiting the foregoing 
 (a) The rules in this Section 2 override anything to the contrary either in the Plan, any other administrative procedures or the communications and election materials provided to participants in the course of administering the Plan. 
 (b) Under no circumstances shall a scheduled payment of a deferred award be accelerated, nor shall a subsequent deferral be permitted with respect to such amounts. 

2.8. Definitions 
 For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms have the designated meanings 
 Company means Ropcor, Inc., and prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date means General Electric Company. 
 Separation from Service means a participant s termination of employment with the Company and all Affiliates (as defined in Section XII of the Plan) provided that Separation from Service for purposes of the Plan shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. 
 Specified Employee means a specified employee as described in the Company s Procedures for Determining Specified Employees under Code Section 409A, as amended from time to time. 
 Section 3. ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED AWARDS 
 3.1. In General 
 At the participant s election, deferred awards will be accounted for in one or more of the following three media cash, Standard and Poor s 500 Index S&P 500 Units or GE common stock Stock Units, or such additional media as described below. 
 3.2. Cash 
 The portion of any award accounted for in cash shall be credited with interest daily based upon the prior calendar month s average yield for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds with maturities of from ten to twenty years. 
 3.3. S&P 500 Units 
 The number of S&P 500 Units credited to a participant s account with respect to any deferral will be determined by dividing (1) the average closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s during the measurement period by (2) the dollar amount of the deferral to be accounted for in S&P 500 Units. The measurement period will be the 20 trading days ending on the date the Company approves awards under the Plan for the year (and including that date if it is a trading date). 
 Each portion of an account hypothetically invested in S&P 500 Units will be credited quarterly, on GE s dividend record date for the quarter, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional S&P 500 Units) based upon the consecutive prior calendar quarter s quarterly dividend as reported by Standard and Poor s. 
 3.4. Stock Units 
 The number of Stock Units credited to a participant s account with respect to any deferral will be determined by dividing (1) the average New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock during the measurement period by (2) the dollar amount of the deferral to be accounted for in Stock Units. The measurement period will be the 20 trading days ending on the date the Company approves awards under the Plan for the year (and including that date if it is a trading date). 

Each portion of an account hypothetically invested in Stock Units will be credited quarterly, on GE s dividend record date for the quarter, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional Stock Units) based on the dividend declared on GE common stock for such quarter. 
 Effective as of the spin-off of General Electric Company s healthcare business as an independent public company (the GE HealthCare Spin-Off ), any accounts credited with Stock Units shall be credited with an additional number of shares of GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) common stock GE HealthCare Stock Units equal to (i) the number of Stock Units credited to such account as of the GE HealthCare Spin-Off, multiplied by (ii) the distribution ratio used to determine the number of shares of GE HealthCare Stock per each share of GE common stock received by record holders of GE common stock upon the GE HealthCare Spin-Off. Any dividends of GE HealthCare Stock will be credited, as applicable, with dividend equivalents (in the form of additional GE HealthCare Stock Units) on the dividend record date. 
 At the one year anniversary of the GE HealthCare Spin-Off, no notional investments in GE HealthCare Stock Units will continue to be permitted under this Plan, and any hypothetical investments remaining in GE HealthCare Stock Units will be automatically converted into a hypothetical cash investment as described in Section 3.2, as if such conversion were a switch as described in Section 3.5, until such time that a participant (or beneficiary) makes a switch as described in Section 3.5 or payment is made as described in Section 3.6. 
 If there is any change in the common stock represented by any deferred award or associated dividend equivalents previously credited, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, share distribution in the nature of a stock dividend, or other change in corporate structure, appropriate adjustments shall be made, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, to the shares of common stock represented by such deferred allotments or dividend equivalents. 
 3.5. Switching 
 Participants (and beneficiaries) may elect four times each calendar year to switch the media in which their accounts are hypothetically invested. Switches will be valued based on (1) the date they are properly effectuated in accordance with administrative procedures, and (2) the applicable New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock (or the applicable exchange closing price of GE HealthCare Stock, if applicable) and or the closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s. 
 A switch must involve at least 25 of a participant s account balance. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) prior to the GE HealthCare Spin-Off, participants may elect to switch their hypothetical investment of Stock Units into a different media permitted under this Plan, even if such participant has already made four elections for the Plan Year and the switch would impact less than 25 of such participant s account balance, and (ii) following the GE HealthCare Spin-Off, participants shall not be permitted to switch the hypothetical investment of their account into GE HealthCare Stock Units. 

3.6. Payments 
 All payments of deferred awards (including any interest or dividend equivalents allocable thereto) will be made in cash. 
 For purposes of making payments, the portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in S&P 500 Units will be valued based on the average closing value of the S&P 500 Index as reported by Standard and Poor s during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year the payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). 
 Similarly, the portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in Stock Units will be valued based on the average New York Stock Exchange closing price of GE common stock during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year a payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). The portion of a participant s account hypothetically invested in GE HealthCare Stock Units will be valued based on the average closing price of such GE HealthCare Stock on the applicable stock exchange during the 20 trading days immediately preceding March 15 of the year a payment is to be made (and including that March 15 if it is a trading date). 
 Section 4. GENERAL CONDITIONS 
 4.1. Creditable Compensation 
 Awards under the Plan shall be taken into account as creditable pay under the Company benefit plans to the same extent and in the same manner that they would have been had they been paid under the GE Incentive Compensation Plan, or pursuant to independent Company action. 
 4.2. Additional Rules 
 The Company has the sole discretion to interpret and apply these procedures and may apply other rules and procedures as it deems necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, rules for making deferral elections, valuing and crediting deferrals, valuing and crediting dividend equivalents, valuing and making switches, defining applicable measuring periods, determining closing prices and closing index values and determining what days constitute trading days. Such rules may or may not be communicated to participants, may or may not be reflected in formal administrative procedures, and may change from year to year. However, no rules or procedures may be applied that would cause a failure to comply with Code Section 409A.

 The Chief Executive Officer of General Electric Company, Senior Vice President of Human Resources of General Electric Company or a delegate of either (a Company Representative may, in the Company Representative s sole discretion, take any one of the following actions

In limited circumstances to be determined by a Company Representative in his or her sole discretion, a proportionately reduced Deferred Termination Allowance may be provided to an Employee with less than 25 years of Pension Qualification Service (or Eligibility Service). 
 (2) In the event an Employee has attained age 55 and will be receiving payments under the Special Early Retirement Option or Plant Closing Pension Option under the GE Aerospace Pension Plan, the Employee may be provided with an amount commencing on the first day of the month after the Employee s Separation from Service that shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable under this Plan if the Employee had attained age 60 before his or her Separation from Service, taking into account only the Pension Benefit Service and Average Annual Compensation to the date of Separation from Service (a SERO PCPO Allowance ). (This paragraph (2) shall not apply to an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit.) 
 1 

Any such Deferred Termination or SERO PCPO Allowance (each an Allowance shall be conferred in a separation agreement executed by the Employee and a Company Representative, and shall be contingent upon the Employee signing such an agreement which will include, among other things, a release and waiver of claims. Such release and waiver of claims must be acceptable to the Company, executed by the deadline established by the Company, and not revoked. The requirement to execute a release and waiver of claims shall not alter the time or form of payment of any benefit under the Program. To the extent the terms of such separation agreement conflict with the terms of this Program, the terms of this Program shall prevail. 
 Any Allowance may be terminated at any time by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of General Electric Company if such committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Employee, or after the death of the Employee, the employee s Surviving Spouse, has acted or is acting in any way inimical to the interests of the Company. Furthermore, any Allowance may be amended, reduced, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors of General Electric Company in its discretion. Any such change shall comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. No such change may accelerate a scheduled payment of benefits hereunder, nor permit a subsequent deferral of benefits hereunder. 
 B. General Conditions 
 (1) All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan or GE Aerospace Pension Plan. Consistent therewith, the form of payment of an Allowance granting an interest in the Employee s Supplementary Pension or Executive Retirement Installment Benefit shall be governed by the terms of the GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Program to the contrary, if an Employee is a Specified Employee, payment of any Allowance shall not be made within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. In the event distribution to a Specified Employee is so delayed, payment of benefits hereunder shall begin on the first day of the seventh month following Separation from Service and, in the case of an allowance based on an Employee s Supplementary Pension, the first such payment may be increased to reflect the missed payments (with interest determined in accordance with Pension Board procedures). Specified Employee means a specified employee as described in the Company s Procedures for Determining Specified Employees under Code Section 409A, as amended from time to time.

 (3) No Employee and no other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Program that are not expressly granted in this Program. For example, the fact that an Allowance may be granted to any eligible Employee, or that an Allowance has been granted to other employees in the past, does not entitle any Employee to such a grant. 
 2 

(4) Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality, no benefit payable at any time hereunder shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment pledge, attachment or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind.

 Each Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Subsections 1 and 2 of this Section C and the individual subject to the Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall be treated as an Affected Transferee provided, however, that the Program Spin-Off Date shall be (i) if the individual does not have a benefit under the GE Pension Plan, the date of such individual s hire or (ii) if the individual has a benefit under the GE Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such individual s benefit under the GE Pension Plan.

 Following the Program Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under a Spin-Off Program is hired by General Electric Company or an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Program is still an Affiliate of General Electric Company (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from the applicable Spin-Off Program to the Program (each such transfer to the Program, a Reverse Program Spin-Off ).

 1 

Allowance ). (This paragraph (2) shall not apply to an Executive Retirement Installment Benefit.) 
 Any such Deferred Termination or SERO PCPO Allowance (each an Allowance shall be conferred in a separation agreement executed by the Employee and a Company Representative, and shall be contingent upon the Employee signing such an agreement which will include, among other things, a release and waiver of claims. Such release and waiver of claims must be acceptable to the Company, executed by the deadline established by the Company, and not revoked. The requirement to execute a release and waiver of claims shall not alter the time or form of payment of any benefit under the Program. To the extent the terms of such separation agreement conflict with the terms of this Program, the terms of this Program shall prevail. 
 Any Allowance may be terminated at any time by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor if such committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Employee, or after the death of the Employee, the employee s Surviving Spouse, has acted or is acting in any way inimical to the interests of the Company. Furthermore, any Allowance may be amended, reduced, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors of the Sponsor in its discretion. Any such change shall comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. No such change may accelerate a scheduled payment of benefits hereunder, nor permit a subsequent deferral of benefits hereunder. 
 B. General Conditions 
 (1) All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan or GE Energy Pension Plan. Consistent therewith, the form of payment of an Allowance granting an interest in the Employee s Supplementary Pension or Executive Retirement Installment Benefit shall be governed by the terms of the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan. 
 (2) The terms of the Program shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Program to the contrary, if an Employee is a Specified Employee, payment of any Allowance shall not be made within the first six months following the Employee s Separation from Service. In the event distribution to a Specified Employee is so delayed, payment of benefits hereunder shall begin on the first day of the seventh month following Separation from Service and, in the case of an allowance based on an Employee s Supplementary Pension, the first such payment may be increased to reflect the missed payments (with interest determined in accordance with Pension Board procedures). Specified Employee means a specified employee as described in the Company s Procedures for Determining Specified Employees under Code Section 409A, as amended from time to time. 
 Except to the extent that the same are governed by the federal law (including Section 409A of the Code), the law of the State of New York shall govern the construction and administration of the Program. 
 (3) No Employee and no other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Program that are not expressly granted in this Program. For example, the fact that an Allowance may be granted to any eligible Employee, or that an Allowance has been granted to other employees in the past, does not entitle any Employee to such a grant. 
 2 

(4) Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality, no benefit payable at any time hereunder shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment pledge, attachment or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such benefit, whether currently or thereafter payable hereunder, shall be void. 
 C. Transfer of GE Energy Benefits and Liabilities from the GE Retirement for the Good of the Company Program. 
 (1) Allocation of Employees 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Program Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the Energy Benefit Liabilities (as defined below) are transferred to this Program (the Program Spin-Off ). The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Retirement for the Good of the Company Program for most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. (For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals who have accrued GE Pension Plan benefits as of the Program Spin-Off Date, the Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Retirement for the Good of the Company Program for individuals whose benefits under the GE Pension Plan are transferred as of the Program Spin-Off Date to the GE Energy Pension Plan.) The participants transferred to this Program are the GE Energy Transferees. No GE Energy Transferee shall have any claims against General Electric Company on any of its affiliates (other than the Sponsor while it is an affiliate of General Electric Company) in respect of benefits under the GE Retirement for the Good of the Company or the Program. 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s energy business may remain in the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 Effective immediately prior to the Program Spin-Off Date, the GE Energy Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program (even if the GE Energy Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or the GE Affiliates, unless the GE Energy Transferee s benefit is transferred back to the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program in accordance with this Section C). Effective on the Program Spin-Off Date, this Program assumes the Energy Benefit Liabilities as a continuation of the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program and each GE Energy Transferee is a participant in this Program. Each GE Energy Transferee s status under this Program on the Program Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the GE Energy Transferee s status under the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program immediately prior to the Program Spin-Off Date. 
 (2) Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities 
 3 

The Program Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of each GE Energy Transferee under the GE Retirement for the Good of the Company Program immediately before the Program Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under this Program immediately after the Program Spin-Off. 
 
 Following the Program Spin-Off, the Sponsor and its Affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under this Program and for all payment obligations hereunder. 
 
 (3) Transfer to this Program after the Program Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Program Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program or the GE HealthCare Retirement for the Good of the Company Program is hired by a GE Affiliate that is part of GE Energy, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program or the GE HealthCare Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, as applicable, to this Program (each such transfer to this Program, a Subsequent Program Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall be effective (i) if the individual does not have a benefit under the GE Aerospace Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan, upon the date of such individual s hire or (ii) if the individual has a benefit under the GE Aerospace Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such individual s benefit under such pension plan to the GE Energy Pension Plan (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). 
 
 Each Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Subsections 1 and 2 of this Section C and the individual subject to the Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall be treated as a GE Energy Transferee provided, however, that the Program Spin-Off Date with respect to such GE Energy Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date. 
 
 Immediately after the Subsequent Program Spin-Off, each GE Energy Transferee included in the Subsequent Program Spin-Off shall cease to be a participant in the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program or the GE HealthCare Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, as applicable, and shall become a participant in the Program. 
 
 (4) Transfers from this Program after the Program Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Program Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under this Program is hired by an Affiliate that is part of GE Aerospace or GE HealthCare, the benefits and liabilities for such individual (each such individual, a Transferred Participant shall be transferred from this Program to the GE Aerospace Retirement for the Good of the Company Program or the GE HealthCare Retirement for the Good of the Company Program, as applicable (each such transfer from the Program, a Reverse Program Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Program Spin-Off shall be effective (i) if the Transferred Participant does not have a benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan, upon the date of the Transferred Participant s hire or (ii) if the Transferred Participant has a benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan, the date of the corresponding transfer of such Transferred Participant s benefit under the GE Energy Pension Plan (the Transfer Date ). 
 
 4 

Each Reverse Program Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument.

 Exhibit 10(m) 

GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan Effective January 1, 2023 
 Section I. Eligibility 
 All Employees, Surviving Spouses and beneficiaries of Employees eligible to receive Pension Benefits under the GE Pension Plan shall be eligible to receive excess benefits under this Plan in accordance with Section II. 
 Effective January 1, 2023, in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising its aviation, healthcare, and energy businesses, respectively, the Plan is renamed the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan, and benefits and liabilities under this Plan attributable to certain individuals are transferred to two newly established plans, as described in Appendix A. Each such plan is a continuation of this Plan with respect to the individuals transferred to it. After December 31, 2022, no individual whose benefit is transferred to another plan (nor any of their beneficiaries) shall accrue additional benefits, or have any rights, under, or with respect to, this Plan (even if such individual is subsequently employed by, or has service with, the Company or its Affiliates), unless the individual s benefit is transferred back to the Plan in accordance with Appendix A. 
 Section II. Excess Benefits 
 1. The amount of the Excess Benefit payable under this Plan to an Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary shall be based upon the excess (if any) of 
 a. the Pension, survivor benefit or death benefit that the Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary would have received under the GE Pension Plan as a result of the retirement or death of the Employee but for the limitations on such benefit imposed by the GE Pension Plan pursuant to Section 415 of the Code, over 
 b. the Pension, survivor benefit or death benefit that the Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary receives under the GE Pension Plan. 
 For all periods during which this Plan is in effect and regardless of whether the Employee s termination of Service date occurs on, before or after January 1, 2009, in no event shall an individual be entitled to receive more benefits from this Plan and the GE Pension Plan combined than he would have been entitled to receive from the GE Pension Plan alone without application of the limits of Section 415 of the Code referred to in Section II.1.a. above. 
 2. Consistent with established Company procedures, if an eligible Employee commences his Excess Benefits at the time set forth in Section III but remains in protected service for other purposes, his initial Excess Benefits shall be based on his service credits earned up to the commencement date of his Excess Benefits. Following the eligible Employee s break in protected service, the dollar amount (but not the form, time or manner of distribution) of the eligible Employee s Excess Benefits shall be adjusted consistent with such procedures to take into 
 1 

account any additional service credits the eligible Employee may have earned under the GE Pension Plan and any related offsets. 
 3. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in no event will any benefits be payable hereunder as a result of the exclusion from the definition of Compensation in the GE Pension Plan of Incentive Compensation, commissions and similar variable compensation paid after the end of the calendar year in which the Employee s Service terminates pursuant to the last sentence of the first paragraph of the definition of Compensation set forth in Section XXVI therein. 
 4. Benefit accruals under the GE Pension Plan are frozen as of December 31, 2020, for Employees who are Frozen Benefit Employees. Accordingly, any Excess Benefit to which an Employee may become entitled under this Plan shall continue to be calculated in conformity with the terms of the GE Pension Plan, including any provisions regarding the calculation of benefits attributable to any period during which the Employee is a Frozen Benefit Employee, and without application of the limits of Section 415 of the Code referred to in Section II.1.a. above. 
 Section III. Payment of Excess Benefits 
 1. All Excess Benefits provided for hereunder which are Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be paid in the same form, time and manner as the benefits payable to such Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary under the GE Pension Plan. 
 2. All Excess Benefits provided for hereunder which are Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be paid in the same form, time and manner as the non-grandfathered plan benefits payable to such Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan. Consistent with the foregoing, the provisions of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan which restrict payments to a Specified Employee during the first six months following Separation from Service shall apply in the same manner hereunder with respect to such Excess Benefits. In addition, if an Employee is not also entitled to benefits from the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, the principles of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan governing the form, time and manner of payment shall nevertheless apply in the same manner hereunder with respect to such Excess Benefits. 
 3. If an Employee is reemployed, the treatment of the Employee s Excess Benefits will be governed by the principles of the reemployment provisions of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (regardless of whether the Employee is otherwise entitled to a Supplementary Pension under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan). 
 Section IV. Beneficiary 
 An Employee s beneficiary for the purposes of this Plan shall be determined in the same manner as beneficiaries are determined under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (regardless of whether the Employee is otherwise entitled to a Supplementary Pension under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan). 
 2 

Section V. Administration 
 1. This Plan shall be administered by the Pension Board, which shall have authority in its sole discretion to make, amend, interpret and enforce rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve in its sole discretion any and all questions which may arise in connection with this Plan. 
 2. In the administration of this Plan, the Pension Board may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit and may, from time to time, consult with counsel, including counsel to the Company. 
 3. The decision or action of the Pension Board in respect of any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of this Plan and the rules and regulations hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in this Plan. 
 Section VI. Amendment and Termination 
 The Company reserves the right, by action of the General Electric Company Board of Directors, to amend, modify or terminate, either retroactively or prospectively, any or all of the provisions of this Plan provided, however, that no such action on its part shall adversely affect the rights of an Employee, his Surviving Spouse or beneficiaries without the consent of such Employee (or his Surviving Spouse or beneficiaries, if the Employee is deceased) with respect to any benefits accrued under this Plan prior to the date of such amendment, modification or termination of the Plan if the Employee has at that time a non-forfeitable right to benefits under Section XII of the GE Pension Plan. Any amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable. No amendment, modification or termination of the Plan may accelerate a scheduled payment of Non- Grandfathered Plan Benefits, nor may any amendment, modification or termination permit a subsequent deferral of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 Section VII. General Conditions 
 1. The Excess Benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid by the Company out of its general assets and shall not be funded in any manner. The obligations that the Company incurs under this Plan shall be subject to the claims of the Company s other creditors having priority as to the Company s assets. 
 2. Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality, no Excess Benefit payable at any time hereunder shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such Excess Benefit, whether currently or thereafter payable hereunder, shall be void. 
 3. No Employee and no other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Plan that are not expressly granted in this Plan. Participation in this Plan does not give any person any right to be retained in the Service of his 
 3 

Employer. The right and power of the Company to dismiss or discharge any Employee is expressly reserved. 
 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section I, employees who are represented by a union (pursuant to a certification by the National Labor Relations Board or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act) shall become eligible to participate in this Plan (a) only after the Company and such union shall have entered into a written agreement to the effect that the Plan shall be offered to the employees so represented, and (b) only in accordance with any conditions or requirements contained in such agreement provided, however, that whenever employees who are eligible for the Plan choose a bargaining agent (pursuant to NLRB certification), they shall continue to be eligible unless and until the certified agent gives notice to the Company that it does not wish such eligibility to continue. 
 5. The rights under this Plan of an Employee who leaves the Service of the Company at any time and the rights of anyone entitled to receive any payments under this Plan by reason of the death of such Employee, shall be governed by the provisions of this Plan in effect on the date such Employee leaves the Service of the Company, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan provided, however, that with respect to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits 
 a. Any Employee who left the Service of the Company on or after January 1, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2009 and commenced receipt of such benefits before January 1, 2009 shall not be eligible to select the revocation feature provided in Section IX.8 of the GE Pension Plan. 
 b. Any Employee who left the Service of the Company on or after January 1, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2009 and did not commence receipt of such benefits before January 1, 2009 (or anyone entitled to receive any payments under the Plan by reason of the death of such Employee who did not commence receipt of such payments before January 1, 2009) shall have the form, time and manner of payment of such benefits determined under the terms contained herein. 
 6. Except to the extent that the same are governed by the federal law (including Section 409A of the Code), the law of the State of New York shall govern the construction and administration of this Plan. 
 7. This Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code with respect to amounts accrued after December 31, 2004 and amounts that were accrued but forfeitable on that date. In addition, if an Employee accrues benefits hereunder on or after January 1, 2005, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code with respect to all of such Employee s benefits hereunder provided, however, that in the case of Grandfathered Specified Employees, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code shall only apply for amounts accrued in excess of Grandfathered Plan Benefits.

Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the entities within GE HealthCare and GE Energy are no longer participating companies under the Plan. Each individual whose benefit is a HealthCare Benefit Liability or an Energy Benefit Liability is an Affected Transferee. Except as otherwise set forth in this Appendix A (with respect to Reverse Plan Spin-Offs), an Affected Transferee who becomes employed by the Company on or after the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be ineligible to participate in the Plan.

 The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the Plan for individuals whose accrued benefits under the GE Pension Plan are transferred as of the Plan Spin-Off Date to the GE Energy Pension Plan i.e. , (i) active employees of GE Energy, and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 Consistent with treatment under the GE Pension Plan, benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses may remain in the Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company.

Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees shall become participants in the applicable Spin-Off Plan. Each Affected Transferee s status under the applicable Spin-Off Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall 
 7 

be the same as the Affected Transferee s status under the Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each Affected Transferee s service with General Electric Company and its Affiliates credited under this Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under the applicable Spin-Off Plan, and (ii) no Affected Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, vesting, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or the corporate spin-offs of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses. 
 Section II. 
 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities 
 
 The Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument.

(For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Sections I and II of this Appendix A and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as an Affected Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such Affected Transferee shall be the date of the Affected Transferee s Qualified Plan Transfer. 
 
 If the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off occurs after the Affected Transferee s transfer of employment or hire, such Affected Transferee shall continue to accrue service for the period until the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off (unless the Affected Transferee s new position involves a change in status under the terms of the Spin-Off Plan), such that the Affected Transferee s benefit under the Spin-Off Plan after the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be the same as if the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the applicable transfer of employment or rehire. 
 
 8 

Immediately after the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off, each Affected Transferee included in the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall cease to be a participant in the Plan (and shall become a participant in the Spin-Off Plan). No individual whose benefits are transferred from the Plan to the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan or the GE Energy Excess Benefits Plan shall have any claims or rights against General Electric Company or any of its Affiliates in respect of benefits under the Plan. 
 
 Section IV. 
 Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under a Spin-Off Plan (1) transfers employment directly to General Electric Company or an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy or (2) is hired by General Electric Company or an Affiliate of General Electric Company that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Plan is still an Affiliate of General Electric Company (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), and such individual s accrued benefit under the GE HealthCare Pension Plan or the GE Energy Pension Plan, as applicable, is transferred to the GE Pension Plan (a Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from the applicable Spin-Off Plan to the Plan, effective at the same time as the Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer (each such transfer to the Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Each such Transferred Participant shall resume participation in the Plan upon the date of the Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer (the Transfer Date ). Regardless of whether the Transfer Date is the same as the date of the change in employment, the Transferred Participant s status under the Plan as of the Transfer Date shall be the same as if the Reverse Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the change in employment (preserving the Transferred Participant s status under the Spin-Off Plan immediately prior to such change in employment, unless the Transferred Participant s new position involves a change in status under the Plan), with service crediting for periods after the change in employment being determined in accordance with the Plan s rules for the Transferred Participant s new position. (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under the applicable Spin-Off Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the Plan immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off.

 For all periods during which this Plan is in effect and regardless of whether the Employee s termination of Service date occurs on, before or after January 1, 2009, in no event shall an individual be entitled to receive more benefits from this Plan and the GE Pension Plan combined than he would have been entitled to receive from the GE Pension Plan alone without application of the limits of Section 415 of the Code referred to in Section II.1.a. above. 
 2. Consistent with established Company procedures, if an eligible Employee commences his Excess Benefits at the time set forth in Section III but remains in protected service for other purposes, his initial Excess Benefits shall be based on his service credits earned up to the commencement date of his Excess Benefits. Following the eligible Employee s break in protected service, the dollar amount (but not the form, time or manner of distribution) of the eligible Employee s 
 1 

Excess Benefits shall be adjusted consistent with such procedures to take into account any additional service credits the eligible Employee may have earned under the GE Pension Plan and any related offsets. 
 3. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in no event will any benefits be payable hereunder as a result of the exclusion from the definition of Compensation in the GE Pension Plan of Incentive Compensation, commissions and similar variable compensation paid after the end of the calendar year in which the Employee s Service terminates pursuant to the last sentence of the first paragraph of the definition of Compensation set forth in Section XXVI therein. 
 4. Benefit accruals under the GE Pension Plan are frozen as of December 31, 2020, for Employees who are Frozen Benefit Employees. Accordingly, any Excess Benefit to which an Employee may become entitled under this Plan shall continue to be calculated in conformity with the terms of the GE Pension Plan, including any provisions regarding the calculation of benefits attributable to any period during which the Employee is a Frozen Benefit Employee, and without application of the limits of Section 415 of the Code referred to in Section II.1.a. above. 
 Section III. Payment of Excess Benefits 
 1. All Excess Benefits provided for hereunder which are Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be paid in the same form, time and manner as the benefits payable to such Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary under the GE Pension Plan. 
 2. All Excess Benefits provided for hereunder which are Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits shall be paid in the same form, time and manner as the non-grandfathered plan benefits payable to such Employee, Surviving Spouse or beneficiary under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan. Consistent with the foregoing, the provisions of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan which restrict payments to a Specified Employee during the first six months following Separation from Service shall apply in the same manner hereunder with respect to such Excess Benefits. In addition, if an Employee is not also entitled to benefits from the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, the principles of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan governing the form, time and manner of payment shall nevertheless apply in the same manner hereunder with respect to such Excess Benefits. 
 3. If an Employee is reemployed, the treatment of the Employee s Excess Benefits will be governed by the principles of the reemployment provisions of the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (regardless of whether the Employee is otherwise entitled to a Supplementary Pension under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan). 
 Section IV. Beneficiary 
 An Employee s beneficiary for the purposes of this Plan shall be determined in the same manner as beneficiaries are determined under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan (regardless of whether the Employee is otherwise entitled to a Supplementary Pension under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan). 
 2 

Section V. Administration 
 1. This Plan shall be administered by the Pension Board, which shall have authority in its sole discretion to make, amend, interpret and enforce rules and regulations for the administration of this Plan and decide or resolve in its sole discretion any and all questions which may arise in connection with this Plan. 
 2. In the administration of this Plan, the Pension Board may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit and may, from time to time, consult with counsel, including counsel to the Company. 
 3. The decision or action of the Pension Board in respect of any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of this Plan and the rules and regulations hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in this Plan. 
 Section VI. Amendment and Termination 
 The Company reserves the right, by action of the Sponsor s Board of Directors, to amend, modify or terminate, either retroactively or prospectively, any or all of the provisions of this Plan provided, however, that no such action on its part shall adversely affect the rights of an Employee, his Surviving Spouse or beneficiaries without the consent of such Employee (or his Surviving Spouse or beneficiaries, if the Employee is deceased) with respect to any benefits accrued under this Plan prior to the date of such amendment, modification or termination of the Plan if the Employee has at that time a non-forfeitable right to benefits under Section XII of the GE Pension Plan. Any amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code to the extent applicable. No amendment, modification or termination of the Plan may accelerate a scheduled payment of Non- Grandfathered Plan Benefits, nor may any amendment, modification or termination permit a subsequent deferral of Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits. 
 Section VII. General Conditions 
 1. The Excess Benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid by the Company out of its general assets and shall not be funded in any manner. The obligations that the Company incurs under this Plan shall be subject to the claims of the Company s other creditors having priority as to the Company s assets. 
 2. Except as to withholding of any tax under the laws of the United States or any state or locality, no Excess Benefit payable at any time hereunder shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such Excess Benefit, whether currently or thereafter payable hereunder, shall be void. 
 3. No Employee and no other person shall have any legal or equitable rights or interest in this Plan that are not expressly granted in this Plan. Participation in this Plan does not give any person any right to be retained in the Service of his 
 3 

Employer. The right and power of the Company to dismiss or discharge any Employee is expressly reserved. 
 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section I, employees who are represented by a union (pursuant to a certification by the National Labor Relations Board or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act) shall become eligible to participate in this Plan (a) only after the Company and such union shall have entered into a written agreement to the effect that the Plan shall be offered to the employees so represented, and (b) only in accordance with any conditions or requirements contained in such agreement provided, however, that whenever employees who are eligible for the Plan choose a bargaining agent (pursuant to NLRB certification), they shall continue to be eligible unless and until the certified agent gives notice to the Company that it does not wish such eligibility to continue. 
 5. The rights under this Plan of an Employee who leaves the Service of the Company at any time and the rights of anyone entitled to receive any payments under this Plan by reason of the death of such Employee, shall be governed by the provisions of this Plan in effect on the date such Employee leaves the Service of the Company, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan provided, however, that with respect to Non-Grandfathered Plan Benefits

 6. Except to the extent that the same are governed by the federal law (including Section 409A of the Code), the law of the State of New York shall govern the construction and administration of this Plan. 
 7. This Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code with respect to amounts accrued after December 31, 2004 and amounts that were accrued but forfeitable on that date. In addition, if an Employee accrues benefits hereunder on or after January 1, 2005, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code with respect to all of such Employee s benefits hereunder provided, however, that in the case of Grandfathered Specified Employees, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code shall only apply for amounts accrued in excess of Grandfathered Plan Benefits. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

Appendix A 
 Transfer of GE Energy Benefits and Liabilities from GE Excess Benefits Plan 
 
 Section I. 
 Allocation of Employees 
 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the Energy Benefit Liabilities (as defined below) are transferred to this Plan (the Plan Spin-Off ). The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the GE Excess Benefits Plan for individuals whose accrued benefits under the GE Pension Plan are transferred as of the Plan Spin-Off Date to the GE Energy Pension Plan i.e. , (i) active employees of GE Energy, and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. The participants transferred to this Plan are the GE Energy Transferees. No GE Energy Transferee shall have any claims against General Electric Company or any of its affiliates (other than the Sponsor while it is an affiliate of General Electric Company) in respect of benefits under the GE Excess Benefits Plan or the Plan. 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s energy business may remain in the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the GE Energy Transferee s (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan , shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan (even if the GE Energy Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or the GE Affiliates, unless the GE Energy Transferee s benefit is transferred back to the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Pl an in accordance with this Appendix A). Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, this Plan assumes the Energy Benefit Liabilities as a continuation of the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan and each GE Energy Transferee is a participant in this Plan. Each GE Energy Transferee s status under this Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the GE Energy Transferee s status under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each GE Energy Transferee s service with General Electric Company and the GE Affiliates credited under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under this Plan, and (ii) no GE Energy Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, vesting, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or the corporate spin-offs of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses. 
 Section II. 
 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities 
 
 The Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of each GE Energy Transferee under the GE 
 7 

Excess Benefits Plan immediately before the Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under this Plan immediately after the Plan Spin-Off. 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off, the Sponsor and its Affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under this Plan and for all payment obligations hereunder. 
 
 Section III. 
 Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan (1) transfers employment directly to a GE Affiliate that is part of GE Energy or (2) is hired by a GE Affiliate that is part of GE Energy, and such individual s accrued benefit under the GE Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan is transferred to the GE Energy Pension Plan (a Qualified Plan Transfer ), the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan, as applicable, to this Plan, effective at the same time as the Qualified Plan Transfer (each such transfer to this Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with Sections I and II of this Appendix A and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as a GE Energy Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such GE Energy Transferee shall be the date of the GE Energy Transferee s Qualified Plan Transfer. 
 
 Immediately after the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off, each GE Energy Transferee included in the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall cease to be a participant in the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan, as applicable, and shall become a participant in the Plan. Regardless of whether the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off occurs at the same time as the change in employment, the GE Energy Transferee s status under the Plan as of the date of the GE Energy Transferee s Qualified Plan Transfer shall be the same as if the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the change in employment (preserving the GE Energy Transferee s status under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan (as applicable) immediately prior to such change in employment, unless the GE Energy Transferee s new position involves a change in status under the Plan), with service crediting for periods after the change in employment being determined in accordance with the Plan s rules for the GE Energy Transferee s new position. 
 
 Section IV. 
 Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under this Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an Affiliate that is part of GE Aerospace or GE HealthCare or (2) is hired by an Affiliate that is part of GE Aerospace or GE HealthCare, and such individual s accrued benefit under the GE Pension Plan or the GE HealthCare Pension Plan, as applicable, is transferred to the GE Pension Plan (a Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer ), the benefits and liabilities for such individual (each such 
 8 

individual, a Transferred Participant shall be transferred from this Plan to the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan, as applicable, effective at the same time as the Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer (each such transfer from the Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Each such Transferred Participant shall cease participation in the Plan as of the date of the Reverse Qualified Plan Transfer. (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s former employer is not an Affiliate when the individual becomes employed by his new employer.) 
 
 If the Reverse Plan Spin-Off occurs after the Transferred Participant s transfer of employment or hire, such Transferred Participant shall continue to accrue service for the period until the Reverse Plan Spin-Off (unless the Transferred Participant s new position involves a change in status under the terms of the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan, as applicable), such that the Transferred Participant s benefit under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan (as applicable) after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be the same as if the Reverse Plan Spin-Off had occurred at the time of the applicable transfer of employment or hire. 
 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this instrument. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under this Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace Excess Benefits Plan or the GE HealthCare Excess Benefits Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off.

 2006 EXECUTIVE DEFERRED SALARY PLAN 
 (As amended and restated effective January 1, 2023) 
 Introduction 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, this General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan shall be renamed the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan (the Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date, and the HealthCare Benefit Liabilities and Energy Benefit Liabilities (each as defined below) are transferred to the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan sponsored by GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) and the GE Energy 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan sponsored by Ropcor, Inc., respectively (each a Spin-Off Plan ), as described below (the Plan Spin-Off ). Each individual whose benefit is a HealthCare Benefit Liability or an Energy Benefit Liability is an Affected Transferee. 
 The HealthCare Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under this Plan for (i) active employees of GE Healthcare Holding LLC (or its successor) and its Affiliates (defined for purposes of this Plan as any company or business entity connected by a direct or indirect 50 or more interest, whether or not participating in the Plan) that comprise General Electric Company s healthcare business GE HealthCare and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare business and certain former employees whose last employer of record within General Electric Company and its Affiliates is not attributable to any of General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare, or energy businesses (or is attributable to General Electric Company s aviation or energy businesses in limited cases), in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 
 The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under this Plan for (i) active employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates that comprise General Electric Company s energy business GE Energy and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of General Electric Company s healthcare and energy businesses may remain in the Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals with a Deferred Account (as defined below) under this Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date who also have a benefit in the GE Pension Plan or Supplementary Pension Plan at that time, their Deferred Account under this Plan will be transferred to the corresponding Spin-Off Plan sponsored by the same entity that will be responsible for their pension benefit (or retained in this Plan accordingly). 

Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in this Plan, shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from this Plan, and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under this Plan (even if the Affected Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or its Affiliates, unless the Affected Transferee s benefit is transferred back to this Plan as described below). 
 Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, the Affected Transferees shall become participants in the applicable Spin-Off Plan. Each Affected Transferee s status under the applicable Spin-Off Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the Affected Transferee s status under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each Affected Transferee s service with General Electric Company and its Affiliates credited under this Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under the applicable Spin-Off Plan and (ii) no Affected Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or corporate spin-off of GE HealthCare or GE Energy. 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Plan and its affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under such Spin-Off Plan and for all payment obligations thereunder. No individual whose benefits are transferred to a Spin-Off Plan shall have any claims or rights against General Electric Company in respect of benefits under this Plan. 
 Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if (1) an individual s employment is directly transferred from General Electric Company or its Affiliate (that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy) to an employer within GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when such employing entity is an Affiliate of General Electric Company or (2) an employee who left the service of General Electric Company and all of its Affiliates is subsequently hired by GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when the employing entity is an Affiliate of General Electric Company, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from this Plan to the applicable Spin-Off Plan (each such transfer to a Spin-Off Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of General Electric Company on the Subsequent Spin-Off Date.) 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with this Plan and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as an Affected Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such Affected Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date. 
 Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, if an individual with an accrued benefit under a Spin-Off Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an employer within General Electric Company and its Affiliates (that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy) from an employer within GE HealthCare or GE Energy, at a time when such employing entity is 
 2 

an Affiliate of General Electric Company or (2) is hired by General Electric Company or its Affiliate (that is not part of GE HealthCare or GE Energy) at a time when the sponsor of the applicable Spin-Off Plan is still an Affiliate of General Electric Company (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from the applicable Spin-Off Plan to this Plan (each such transfer to this Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Transfer Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of General Electric Company on the Transfer Date.) 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Plan and applicable law. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under the applicable Spin-Off Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under this Plan immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off.

GE ENERGY 2006 EXECUTIVE DEFERRED SALARY PLAN 
 (Effective as of January 1, 2023) 
 Introduction 
 Effective January 1, 2023 (the Plan Spin-Off Date ), in anticipation of General Electric Company s split into three separate companies comprising General Electric Company s aviation, healthcare and energy businesses, respectively, the Energy Benefit Liabilities (as defined below) are transferred to this GE Energy 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan (the Plan ), as described below (the Plan Spin-Off ). The Energy Benefit Liabilities are the benefits and liabilities under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan for (i) active employees of Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates (defined for purposes of this Plan as any company or business entity connected by a direct or indirect 50 or more interest, whether or not a participating employer in the Plan that comprise General Electric Company s energy business GE Energy and (ii) most former employees of General Electric Company s energy business, in each case, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. The participants transferred to this Plan are the GE Energy Transferees. 
 Benefits and liabilities for certain former employees of GE Energy may remain in the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan or be transferred to the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan, as determined by General Electric Company in its sole discretion and identified on a list maintained in the records of General Electric Company. 
 For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to individuals with a Deferred Account (as defined below) under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date who also have a benefit in the GE Pension Plan or Supplementary Pension Plan at that time, their Deferred Account under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan will be transferred to this Plan only if a GE Energy entity will be responsible for their pension benefit. 
 Effective immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date, the GE Energy Transferees (including, as applicable, their beneficiaries) shall cease to be participants in the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan , which shall be renamed the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan as of the Plan Spin-Off Date, shall no longer be entitled to any benefit payments from the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan , and shall no longer have any rights whatsoever under the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan (even if the GE Energy Transferee is subsequently employed by, or has service with, General Electric Company or its Affiliates, unless the GE Energy Transferee s benefit is transferred back to the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan as described below). 
 Effective on the Plan Spin-Off Date, this Plan assumes the Energy Benefit Liabilities as a continuation of the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan and each GE Energy Transferee is a participant in this Plan. Each GE Energy Transferee s status under this Plan on the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be the same as the GE Energy Transferee s status under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) each GE Energy Transferee s service with General Electric Company and its Affiliates credited under the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan immediately prior to the Plan Spin-Off Date shall be credited under 

this Plan and (ii) no GE Energy Transferee shall be treated as incurring a termination of employment, separation from service, retirement or similar event for purposes of determining the right to a distribution, benefits or any other purpose under this Plan solely as a result of the Plan Spin-Off or corporate spin-off of General Electric Company s healthcare business or GE Energy. 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date, Ropcor, Inc. and its Affiliates shall have exclusive responsibility for paying benefits under this Plan and for all payment obligations hereunder. 
 Transfers to this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date but prior to the corporate spin-off of General Electric Company s energy business as an independent public company (the GE Energy Spin-Off , if (1) an individual s employment is directly transferred to GE Energy from an employer within General Electric Company and its Affiliates (that is not part of GE Energy) or (2) an employee who left the service of General Electric Company and all of its Affiliates is subsequently hired by GE Energy, the benefits and liabilities for such individual shall be transferred from the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan (or, if applicable, the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan) to this Plan (each such transfer to this Plan, a Subsequent Plan Spin-Off ). Such Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Subsequent Spin-Off Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of Ropcor, Inc. on the Subsequent Spin-Off Date.) 
 Each Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be completed in a manner consistent with this Plan and the individual subject to the Subsequent Plan Spin-Off shall be treated as a GE Energy Transferee provided, however, that the Plan Spin-Off Date with respect to such GE Energy Transferee shall be the Subsequent Spin-Off Date. 
 Transfers from this Plan after the Plan Spin-Off Date 
 Following the Plan Spin-Off Date but prior to the GE Energy Spin-Off, if an individual with an accrued benefit under this Plan (1) transfers employment directly to an employer within General Electric Company and its Affiliates (that is not part of GE Energy) or (2) is hired by General Electric Company or its Affiliate (that is not part of GE Energy) (each such individual, a Transferred Participant ), the benefits and liabilities for such Transferred Participant shall be transferred from this Plan to the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan (or, if applicable, the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan) (each such transfer from this Plan, a Reverse Plan Spin-Off ). Such Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effective upon such transfer of employment or hire (the Transfer Date ). (For the avoidance of doubt, no Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall occur in connection with a transfer of employment if such individual s employer is not an Affiliate of Ropcor, Inc. on the Transfer Date.) 
 Each Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall be effected in accordance with the applicable requirements of this Plan and applicable law. The accrued benefit of the Transferred Participant under this Plan immediately before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off shall become his accrued benefit under the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan or the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. 
 2 

The liabilities under this Plan before the Reverse Plan Spin-Off for benefits accrued under (or transferred to) the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan or the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan, as applicable, with respect to Transferred Participants before the Transfer Date shall become liabilities under the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan or the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan, as applicable, immediately after the Reverse Plan Spin-Off. 
 No individual whose benefits are transferred from this Plan to the GE Aerospace 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan or the GE HealthCare 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan shall have any claims or rights against GE Energy in respect of benefits under this Plan. 
 Because this Plan is a continuation of the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan for Deferred Accounts of GE Energy Transferees, this document includes the provisions of the General Electric Company 2006 Executive Deferred Salary Plan that applied before January 1, 2023.

If no such designated beneficiary survives the Participant, such remaining benefits shall be paid as set forth above to the Participant s estate. 
 VII. Administration and Interpretation 
 This Plan shall be administered by a Committee consisting of not less than two persons appointed from time to time by the Chairman. The Committee shall have full power and authority on behalf of the Plan sponsor to administer and interpret the Plan in its sole discretion. All Committee decisions with respect to the administration and interpretation of the Plan shall be final and binding upon all persons. 
 For purposes of determining when payments from the Plan commence, for periods on and after January 1, 2009, termination of employment shall occur when a Participant has Separated from Service, which means the Participant has terminated employment with the Plan sponsor and all Affiliates (defined for this purpose as any company or business entity in which the Plan sponsor has a 50 or more interest whether or not a participating employer in the Plan) provided that Separation from Service for purposes of the Plan shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of Code Section 409A and regulations and other guidance issued hereunder.
