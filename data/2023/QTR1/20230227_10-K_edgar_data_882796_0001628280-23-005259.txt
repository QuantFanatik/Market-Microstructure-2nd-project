 Risk Factor Summary 
 An investment in the Company involves risks. You should carefully read this entire report and consider the uncertainties and risks discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this report, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, along with the other information included in our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision in the Company. A summary of the principal factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky is set forth below. 
 The ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic could create challenges in all aspects of our business, including, without limitation, delays, stoppages, difficulties, and increased expenses with respect to our and our partners development, regulatory processes, and supply chains, negatively impact our ability to access the capital or credit markets to finance our operations, or have the effect of heightening many of the risks described below or in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
 We have incurred losses since our inception, expect to continue to incur losses, and may never be profitable. 
 We may need to raise additional capital in the future. If we are unable to raise capital as and when needed, we may need to adjust our operations. 
 Our success depends upon our ability to manage our product candidate pipeline, advance our product candidates through the various stages of development, especially through the clinical trial process, and to receive and maintain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates. The development process and related regulatory processes are complex and uncertain, may be lengthy and expensive, and require, among other things, an indication that our products and product candidates are safe and effective. For example, applicable regulatory agencies could refuse to approve, or impose restrictions or warnings on, our product candidates, require us to conduct additional studies or adopt study designs that differ from our planned development strategies, suspend or terminate our clinical trials, withdraw approval for our products, or take other actions that could materially impact the cost, timing, and success of our planned development and commercialization strategies. 
 We rely heavily upon third parties, including development partners, contractors, contract research organizations, and third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, for many important stages of our product candidate development and in the commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates. Our failure to establish and maintain these relationships, the failure of any such third party to perform its obligations under agreements with us, or the failure of such a relationship to meet our 
 2 

Table of Contents 

 expectations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 If we fail to obtain additional financing or acceptable partnership arrangements as and when needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or continue operations. 
 The commercial viability of any approved product could be compromised if the product is less effective than expected, causes undesirable side effects that either were not previously identified or worse than expected, or fails to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, health authorities, and others. 
 There can be no assurance that our or our partners commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain. 
 We have expanded, and may continue expanding, our development and regulatory capabilities and implementing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced. In addition, developments by others may render our products, product candidates, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations related to our products and product candidates, and if we or our employees, consultants, or partners do not comply with these laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we and our partners may be subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals, and healthcare payor initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our or our partners ability to market our products, develop our product candidates, obtain collaborators, and raise capital. 
 If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of those rights would diminish. Legal proceedings to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our partners, or our other intellectual property rights could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. If we fail to secure the rights to patents of others, this could adversely affect our business. 
 We face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products or product candidates results in personal injury or death, and our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient. 
 We face risks related to our government-funded programs and are subject to various U.S. Government contract requirements, which typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on U.S. Government contracts. 
 If we fail to reach milestones or to make annual minimum payments or otherwise breach our obligations under our license agreements, our licensors may terminate our agreements with them and/or seek additional remedies. 
 Our Credit Agreement contains conditions and restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be required to make a prepayment or repay our outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement earlier than we expect if a prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks. For example, our actual or perceived failure to comply with European governmental laws and regulations and other obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security could harm our business. In addition, the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union could result in increased regulatory and legal complexity, which may make it more difficult for us to do business in Europe and impose additional challenges in securing regulatory approval of our product candidates in Europe.

 If our facilities incur damage or power is lost for a significant length of time, our business will suffer. 
 A significant disruption in our or our third-party information technology systems or a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our business. 
 Our existing principal stockholders hold a substantial amount of our common stock and may be able to influence significant corporate decisions, which may conflict with the interests of other stockholders. 
 Our stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline significantly. 
 Natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, armed conflicts, political unrest, or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators, or third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future. 
 Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market and economic conditions. 
 We are subject to legal proceedings, which could harm our reputation or result in other losses or unexpected expenditure of time and resources. 
 If we fail to retain our existing key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel, the development of our product candidates, the commercialization of our products, and the related expansion of our business will be delayed or stopped.

 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Our Business 
 We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company that discovers and commercializes novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts that are commercially available or that are in active development are summarized in the table below and are discussed in further detail under Products and Product Candidates in this Part I Item 1 Business section of this report.

 protease enzyme for activation of the classical and lectin pathways. See Business Products and Product Candidates Complement-Mediated Diseases below for additional details. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is twofold: to serve patients and to create stockholder value both by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists and by efficiently commercializing these drugs in the United States and certain other regions upon regulatory approval. By focusing on rare disease markets, we believe that we can more effectively control the costs of, and our strategic allocation of financial resources toward, post-approval commercialization. 
 We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. We are unique in our approach to treat orphan diseases with orally-administered, small molecules, identified by utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are: 
 Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed structural analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad intellectual property protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages. 
 Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target. 
 Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to progress our product candidates efficiently through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we typically strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval or diseases where high unmet needs allow for frequent interactions with regulators. In addition, as we determine such relationships to be appropriate or desirable, we control certain fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties. By outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk. 
 Commercializing our Product Candidates Globally. A core part of our strategy is to commercialize our rare disease products globally. We have established commercial teams in the United States and other global markets for the commercialization of ORLADEYO, and we are continuing to build the structure and expertise to commercialize our products in additional markets where we believe we can do this efficiently and effectively. We have also established relationships with licensing, distribution and other partners in certain markets, including Japan, the pan-Latin America region, and parts of Europe and Asia, and will continue to seek such relationships where we determine this to be an effective approach. 
 Products and Product Candidates 
 ORLADEYO (Berotralstat) 
 ORLADEYO is an oral, once-daily therapy discovered and developed by us for the prevention of hereditary angioedema HAE attacks. HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition with a prevalence of between 1 in 33,000 to 1 in 67,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, 
 6 

Table of Contents 

 including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, ORLADEYO suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients. 
 ORLADEYO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in December 2020 for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Our specialty pharmacy provider for ORLADEYO in the United States began shipping ORLADEYO to patients with a prescription in the United States in December 2020. Through EMPOWER Patient Services, administered by our specialty pharmacy provider, we aim to streamline access to therapy by providing each HAE patient and their healthcare provider with a single point of contact for access to ORLADEYO. A dedicated care coordinator supports access for each patient with comprehensive financial support tools and reimbursement support. 
 In 2021, we announced that ORLADEYO received approvals in the European Union, Japan, the United Arab Emirates UAE and the United Kingdom. Under our agreement with Torii, our collaborative partner commercializing ORLADEYO in Japan, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20 to 40 of net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. See Collaborations and In-License Relationships below for a description of our relationship with Torii. 
 On January 10, 2022, we announced that ORLADEYO is now covered by all major payors and national and regional pharmacy benefit managers in the United States. 
 On February 24, 2022, we announced new long-term efficacy and safety data from the APeX-2 clinical trial evaluating ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE showing sustained reductions in attack rates and improvement in quality of life among patients living with HAE, regardless of their baseline attack rates and initial responses to ORLADEYO. 
 On June 6, 2022, we announced that Health Canada approved ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in Canada. 
 On June 7, 2022, we announced that Swissmedic granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in patients 12 years and older in Switzerland. 
 On June 9, 2022, we announced that the Company entered into an exclusive collaboration with Pint Pharma GmbH Pint Pharma to register and promote ORLADEYO in the pan-Latin America region. Under the terms of the agreement, Pint Pharma will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all marketing authorizations and for commercializing ORLADEYO in the region. 
 On July 1, 2022, we announced new long-term efficacy and safety data from the APeX-2 and APeX-S clinical trials evaluating ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE showing sustained reductions in attack rates and improvement in quality of life among patients living with HAE, as well as improved management of symptoms after switching to ORLADEYO from an injectable long-term prophylactic treatment. 
 On August 4, 2022, we announced that pricing for ORLADEYO was finalized in Germany, France, and Switzerland in the second quarter of 2022. 
 On August 18, 2022, we announced that the Saudi Food and Drug Authority approved ORLADEYO to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in Saudi Arabia. 
 On November 10, 2022, we announced new real-world data demonstrating rapid, sustained reduction of patient-reported HAE attacks and consistently low attack rates among patients 12 years and older who started on ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE, including patients who switched from other prophylactic therapies. 
 On November 28, 2022, we announced that the Israeli Ministry of Health granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in Israel.

 On January 23, 2023, we announced that the Company entered into a collaboration with Swixx BioPharma AG Swixx to commercialize ORLADEYO in Central and Eastern Europe CEE ). Under the terms of the agreement, Swixx will be responsible for commercializing ORLADEYO in 15 markets within CEE. 
 On January 26, 2023, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the pivotal APeX-P trial evaluating ORLADEYO in pediatric HAE patients who are 2 to Table of Contents 

 inhibitor currently in clinical development and pursue additional oral compounds for multiple targets across other complement pathways. 
 BCX10013 
 On November 1, 2022, we announced that we have begun a clinical program with BCX10013, a novel, potent, and specific Factor D inhibitor. On January 9, 2023, we announced that initial data from ongoing phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trials in healthy volunteers showed rapid, sustained and >97 percent suppression of the alternative pathway of the complement system 24 hours following a single 110 mg dose, and that BCX10013 has been safe and generally well-tolerated at all doses studied to date. On February 21, 2023, we announced that recent dose-related observations in an ongoing BCX10013 nonclinical study will delay the clinical program. 
 Under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements, RPI will be entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales, if any, of BCX10013, as well as tiered, profit share amounts of up to 3.0 from certain other permitted sales in certain markets.

 On November 1, 2022, we announced that, in addition to BCX10013, which targets the alternative pathway of complement, we are pursuing oral medicines directed at other targets across the classical, lectin and terminal pathways of the complement system, including C2, a critical upstream serine protease enzyme for activation of the classical and lectin pathways. We have developed potent, selective molecules targeting C2, which are currently in lead optimization. 
 Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva FOP 
 FOP is an ultra-rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 2 million people worldwide. It is a severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification. There is no cure for this condition, and there are no approved treatments for FOP in the United States. 
 On November 1, 2022, we announced that we believe that patients with FOP are likely to benefit from other oral ALK-2 inhibitors that currently are substantially ahead of our ALK-2 inhibitor, BCX9250, in development. Considering the expectation that patients will be well-served by these other products, and the approximately 100 million in additional investment that would be required to advance BCX9250 to approval, we are stopping the BCX9250 program and redirecting this investment to the other opportunities we have to serve patients with complement-mediated diseases. 
 Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, RAPIACTA, PERAMIFLU) 
 RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) was developed under a 234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services BARDA/HHS ). In January 2010, our partner, Shionogi, received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It is approved in Japan for the treatment of adults, children, and infants with uncomplicated seasonal influenza and those patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In August 2010, our partner, Green Cross, received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. See Collaborations and In-License Relationships below for a discussion of these licensing arrangements. 
 Peramivir was also approved in the United States in 2014, Taiwan in 2016, Canada in 2017, and Australia in 2018. A Supplemental New Drug Application sNDA was approved in the United States in February 2021, extending RAPIVAB s availability for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza to pediatric patients six months and older. Prior to this approval, peramivir had been indicated in the United States for pediatric patients two years and older. In the United States, peramivir is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. 
 In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS awarded us a 34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency. We initially delivered 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract in

Table of Contents 

 2019 for a total price of approximately 13.9 million. We further delivered 20,000 and 9,980 doses of RAPIVAB in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and recorded revenue of 13.9 million and 6.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 49,980 RAPIVAB doses of the 50,000 RAPIVAB doses available under the contract, effectively completing the contract with HHS. 
 Galidesivir (BCX4430) 
 Galidesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral that has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Marburg, Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Zika viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack. Our galidesivir research program has been substantially funded with federal funds under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the HHS NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS. All of our government funding for galidesivir expired in 2022, and we have no plans to continue the galidesivir program without government funding. 
 Collaborations and In-License Relationships 
 ORLADEYO 
 Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Torii 
 On November 5, 2019, we entered into a Commercialization and License Agreement with Torii (the Torii Agreement ), granting Torii the exclusive right to commercialize ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan. Under the Torii Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of 22.0 million. We received an additional milestone payment of 15.0 million in the second quarter of 2021 upon receipt from the Japanese National Health Insurance System NHI of a reimbursement price approval for ORLADEYO. 
 Under the Torii Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20 to 40 of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. Torii s royalty payment obligations are subject to customary reductions in certain circumstances, but may not be reduced by more than 50 of the amount that otherwise would have been payable to us in the applicable calendar quarter. Torii s royalty payment obligations commenced upon the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan and expire upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan, (ii) the expiration of our patents covering ORLADEYO, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for ORLADEYO in Japan. We are responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Torii Agreement are overseen by a joint steering committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from each party to coordinate the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan. 
 Under the Torii Agreement, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation ROFN to commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan for the acute treatment of HAE attacks if we develop ORLADEYO for such indication and to commercialize any additional kallikrein inhibitor that we may develop in the future for use in HAE in Japan. Under both ROFNs, if the parties do not agree to terms with respect to a definitive amendment to the Torii Agreement or new agreement, as applicable, the terms of the amendment or agreement would be set by a third-party arbitrator. 
 Other Collaborations for ORLADEYO 
 We have entered into a number of collaborations with commercial partners to help support the global launch of ORLADEYO. In 2021, we entered into supply and distribution agreements with Neopharm Ltd. Neopharm and NewBridge Pharmaceuticals NewBridge to support commercialization efforts in Israel and the UAE, respectively. Under the terms of these agreements, Neopharm will have the exclusive rights to commercialize ORLADEYO in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and NewBridge will support commercialization efforts in the UAE, as well as the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iraq. On June 9, 2022, we announced that we have entered into an exclusive collaboration with Pint Pharma to register and promote ORLADEYO in the pan-Latin America region. Under the terms of the agreement, Pint Pharma will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all marketing authorizations and for commercializing ORLADEYO in the region. On January 23, 2023, we announced that we have entered into a collaboration with Swixx to commercialize ORLADEYO in CEE. Under the terms of the agreement, Swixx will be responsible for commercializing ORLADEYO in 15 markets within CEE.

 Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, RAPIACTA, PERAMIFLU) 
 Shionogi Co., Ltd. Shionogi 
 In February 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Shionogi Agreement ), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. The Shionogi Agreement provided for an upfront payment in exchange for the rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan, development milestone payments (which have all been paid), commercial milestone payments, and royalty payments on product sales of peramivir, in accordance with the terms of the Shionogi Agreement. 
 Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate the Shionogi Agreement in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham UAB and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi. 
 Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable 
 On March 9, 2011, we completed a 30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement. Pursuant to the transaction, JPR Royalty Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Royalty Sub ), issued 30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0 Notes due 2020 (the PhaRMA Notes in a private placement to institutional investors. The PhaRMA Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the Indenture ), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We received net proceeds of 22.7 million from this transaction. 
 Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are payable from, and are secured by the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, which were transferred by us to Royalty Sub in 2011. We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes. Royalty Sub s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. 
 In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding payment date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014. This inability constituted an event of default under the terms of the Indenture. Accordingly, we classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet since that time. The PhaRMA Notes matured on December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of 30.0 million, together with all accrued and unpaid interest of 20.6 million, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date, constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Contractual Arrangements Because continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub. As a result, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments, if any, that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we could otherwise be adversely affected in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the PhaRMA Notes remained in default. We wrote off the balance due under the PhaRMA Notes to other income as a debt extinguishment as of December 31, 2021. See Note 8 Royalty Monetizations RAPIACTA Non-Recourse Notes Payable Debt Extinguishment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the write-off.

 Green Cross Corporation Green Cross 
 In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea and we are entitled to share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products, and other information would be transferred to us. 
 Additional Collaborations 
 We have previously entered into contracts with the U.S. Government, including the procurement contract with HHS for up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency and contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS for the development of galidesivir, as more fully discussed above under Products and Product Candidates and in Note 15 Collaborative and Other Relationships in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 49,980 RAPIVAB doses of the 50,000 RAPIVAB doses available under the procurement contract, effectively completing the contract with HHS, and all of our government funding for galidesivir has expired. 
 We also have non-material license agreements with certain third parties, such as Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University AECOM ), Industrial Research, Ltd. IRL ), and the University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB ), which require that we make certain payments related to development of the product candidates covered by these agreements, net sales on any resulting product made by us, and annual license fees. We licensed a series of potent inhibitors of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase from AECOM and IRL, as well as an exclusive worldwide license of galidesivir for any antiviral use, and we have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts received. 
 Patents and Proprietary Information 
 Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology, and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology, and products and product candidates. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have been issued approximately 31 U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2039 and that relate to our kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, broad-spectrum antiviral BSAV compounds, purine nucleoside phosphorylase PNP inhibitor compounds, and complement-mediated disease 
 12

 program compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, totaling three additional U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 25 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP inhibitor compounds, FOP program compounds, and complement-mediated disease program compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any, jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories. 
 Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive commercial and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, many have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations who conduct research in areas in which we are working. 
 We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial marketing and sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Our commercial potential could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Any of these competitive factors may impact our decisions with respect to our products, product candidates and early-stage discovery programs. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Competing in our Industry in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks. 
 In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies. 
 HAE 
 HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 33,000 to 67,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor C1-INH ), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40 primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are several licensed therapies for HAE, including the following: 
 C1-INH replacement therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert and as a prophylactic therapy (Haegarda and Cinryze ). These therapies are dosed subcutaneously and intravenously. Recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest is also available as an acute therapy. 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 Kallikrein Inhibitors Kalbitor (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is dosed subcutaneously by healthcare providers to treat acute HAE attacks. Takhzyro (lanadelumab-flyo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
 Bradykinin receptor antagonist Firazyr (icatibant) and generic icatibant are indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration. 
 Other medications Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in liver damage, virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended for patients on chronic androgen therapy. 
 We are aware of a number of HAE therapies in clinical development that, if approved, may compete with ORLADEYO. These include: 
 Company Asset Mechanism of Action Route of Administration Trial Phase Role in Therapy KalVista Sebetralstat Kallikrein inhibitor Oral III Acute treatment Pharvaris PHA121 (PHVS416/PHVS719) B2 receptor antagonist Oral II/III Acute and Prophylaxis Attune ATN-249 Kallikrein inhibitor Oral I Prophylaxis CSL Garadacimab Anti-factor XII mAb IV/Subcutaneous III Prophylaxis Ionis Donidalorsen Prekallikrien Antisense Subcutaneous III Prophylaxis Astria STAR-0215 Kallikrein inhibitor Subcutaneous Ia Prophylaxis ADARx ADX-324 siRNA Subcutaneous I Prophylaxis Intellia NTLA-2002 Gene Therapy IV I/II BioMarin BMN-331 Gene Therapy IV I/II 
 Complement-Mediated Diseases 
 Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by defects of the complement system, including, but not limited to, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria PNH ), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome aHUS ), complement 3 glomerulopathy C3G ), Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy IgAN ), and myasthenia gravis. Alexion s (part of AstraZeneca Rare Disease) Soliris (eculizumab) is a C5 inhibitor approved for PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Soliris had global sales of over 3.7 billion in 2022. Alexion also received FDA approval for Ultomiris (ravulizumab), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, as a treatment for PNH in late 2018 and aHUS in late 2019. Global sales for Ultomiris were over 1.9 billion in 2022. Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. s Empaveli is a C3 inhibitor approved for PNH in the United States and Europe in 2021.

 We are aware of a number of complement pathway-based products in development, which include: 
 Company Asset Mechanism of Action Route of Administration Trial Phase Apellis Empaveli C3 Inhibitor Subcutaneous Approved Akari Nomacopan C5 Inhibitor Subcutaneous III Roche Crovalimab (RG6107) C5 Inhibitor IV / Subcutaneous III Regeneron Pozelimab C5 Inhibitor IV / Subcutaneous III Omeros Narsoplimab OMS906 MASP-2 Inhibitor MASP-3 Inhibitor IV / Subcutaneous Subcutaneous BLA I AstraZeneca Danicopan (ALXN2040) Vermicopan (ALXN2050) Factor D Inhibitor Factor D Inhibitor Oral Oral III II Novartis Iptacopan (LNP023) Tesidolumab Factor B Inhibitor C5 Inhibitor Oral IV III II ChemoCentryx Tavneos (avacopan) C5aR Inhibitor Oral Approved Ra / UCB Zilucoplan C5 Inhibitor Subcutaneous II Alnylam Cemdisiran C5 Inhibitor Subcutaneous II 
 Amgen (Phase 3), Samsung, and Isu Abxis are also in clinical trials developing biosimilars of eculizumab. 
 Certain diseases that are mediated by defects of the complement system, such as IgAN, may also have pathology that is mediated by other mechanisms. Products that are not inhibitors of the complement system, such as Tarpeyo (DR-budesonide) for IgAN, may change the treatment landscape and future competitive environment for our products. 
 Antivirals 
 The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements, and reimbursement. A number of products are currently available in the United States and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. s Roche TAMIFLU (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, GlaxoSmithKline plc s GSK RELENZA , Genentech and Shiongi s XOFLUZA and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. s INAVIR . In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan. 
 Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors. 
 Research and Development 
 We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies, including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry, and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early-stage clinical trials. 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and foreign governments. These regulations include, among other things, regulations for the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred, and significant time may be devoted to clinical development. Further, the duration of the approval process may be exacerbated by global health concerns or other 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 considerations that could prevent regulatory authorities from conducting their inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities that could significantly impact the ability of such authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions. 
 
 Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve a product candidate, the approval may limit the indicated uses for the product candidate, impose other restrictions on the product candidate, and/or may require post-approval studies that could impair the commercial viability of the product candidate. Even upon any approval to market our potential products, whether in the United States or internationally, we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements are wide ranging and govern, among other things: 
 
 adverse drug experience reporting regulations; 
 product promotion; 
 product manufacturing, including good manufacturing practice requirements; and product changes or modifications. 
 These government regulations are a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including: 
 delays; 
 warning letters; 
 fines; 
 product recalls or seizures; 
 injunctions; 
 penalties; 
 refusal of the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications; 
 total or partial suspension of production; 
 civil penalties; 
 withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and 
 criminal prosecutions. 
 The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or approval of new indications for our existing products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 FDA Regulation 
 Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an investigational new drug application IND ), including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial. 
 Clinical trials to support a new drug application NDA are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 
 Phase 1 During phase 1, which involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses. 
 Phase 2 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3 (pivotal) If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies, or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials be conducted. 
 Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent upon many factors, including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board IRB ), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in a study depends on: 
 willingness of investigators to participate in a study; 
 ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB; 
 the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial; 
 the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat; 
 the willingness of patients to participate; and 
 the patients meeting the eligibility criteria. 
 Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines. 
 After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application filed at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 6 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 10 months. The FDA may refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regard to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee. 
 Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an action letter on the application. The action letter will either be an approval letter, in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two- or six-month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the NDA. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. 
 Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For example, advertising and promotion are subject to stringent FDA rules and oversight, and as an NDA holder, we may be held responsible for any advertising and promotion that is not in compliance with the rules and regulations. In particular, the claims in all promotional materials and activities must be consistent with the FDA approvals for approved products and must be appropriately substantiated and fairly balanced with information on the safety risks and limitations of the products. We are also required to engage in appropriate truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning our products. 
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing 
 17

 testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice cGMP regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets. 
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation, if sought, must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active ingredient to receive FDA approval of the designated drug for the disease indication for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not finally approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided that the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee for the orphan indication. 
 Fast Track Designation 
 Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of an IND may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate as a Fast Track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor s request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a Fast Track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with, and guidance to, the sponsor. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA s review period as specified under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA has been submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval, commercial sales, and distribution of drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, some of which are discussed below, and may also include post-approval commitments.

 European Union 
 The various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (the Clinical Trials Directive ), a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the national competent authority of each EU member state in which a clinical trial is planned to be conducted. A clinical trial application CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents, including, but not limited to, the clinical trial protocol. Further, a clinical trial may only be started after an independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the CTA in that country. 
 In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the Regulation ), which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The Regulation came into effect on January 31, 2022 with a three-year transition period in which clinical trial sponsors will be able to choose among different submission pathways. The Regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU member states, aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 Manufacturing and import into the European Union of investigational medicinal products for use in clinical trials is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMP. 
 Under EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency EMA ), which then makes a recommendation to the European Commission EC ). The EC makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. 
 United Kingdom 
 The United Kingdom s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA is the United Kingdom s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together, Great Britain or GB ). Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority remains the MHRA. The MHRA published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiration of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the United Kingdom. The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the European Union. 
 Japan 
 Under the Japanese regulatory system administered by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency PMDA ), pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval, we must submit an application for approval to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare MHLW with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy, and safety of a new drug. A data compliance review, good Clinical Practices on-site inspection, cGMP audit, and detailed data review are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council PAFSC ). Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by the MHLW. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. The price will be determined within 60 to 90 days following approval unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, 
 19

 however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The Japanese government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. 
 Fraud and Abuse and Related Regulatory Laws 
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including both federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. Outside of the United States, we may be subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations apply to our or our partners operations, sales and marketing practices, price reporting, and relationships with physicians and other customers and third-party payors. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. 
 In addition, we are subject to the federal physician sunshine act and certain similar physician payment and drug pricing transparency legislation in various states. The sunshine provisions apply to manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government certain payments made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. 
 Violations of the physician sunshine act and similar legislation or the fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and future exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. 
 Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform 
 In both the United States and other countries, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. 
 Adequate coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other countries is critical to the commercial success of approved products. Recently in the United States, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed, among other things, to reform government program reimbursement methodologies. In addition, individual states in the United States have been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Many third-party payors negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies that establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the third-party payor s patient population. The process for obtaining coverage can be lengthy and costly, and it could take several months before a particular payor initially reviews a product and makes a decision with respect to coverage. For example, third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of a particular product.

 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for drug products can have challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct an active comparator clinical trial to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates or products to other available therapies to support our pricing, which could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, including reference price grouping, price freezes, increased price cuts, and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act PPACA made extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the United States. The PPACA included numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately and others of which have taken effect over the past several years. For example, the PPACA expanded healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The PPACA also imposed substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the United States, and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The PPACA also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also required reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals. 
 The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose certain payments and transfers of value to, and investment interests held by, physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Compliance with the PPACA and state laws with similar provisions is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. For example, legislation has been enacted in certain states and at a federal level that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with these electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security, and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information PHI ), than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA or that enter into a resolution agreement with the HHS to settle actual or potential allegations of HIPAA noncompliance may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations. 
 Many state laws govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 the CCPA, other personal information may be covered, and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope. Other states, such as Virginia, Colorado and Utah, have also enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and it is possible that additional states will follow suit. 
 
 EU member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Economic Area EEA ), the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations, and guidelines of the states in the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also imposes additional special protections for special category data, which includes health, biometric and genetic information of data subjects located in the EEA and, through incorporation in national legislation, the United Kingdom. Further, the GDPR provides a broad right for EU member states to create supplemental national laws, for example relating to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. The GDPR and similar national legislation grant individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allow them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provide the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR and similar national legislation impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other countries to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer adequate privacy protections. These obligations and regulations also concern security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
 
 The EU Clinical Trials Regulation also imposes new obligations to make publicly available certain information generated from clinical trials. Only very limited information is exempted from disclosure, i.e. commercially confidential information (which is construed increasingly narrowly) and protected personal data. It may be possible for others to use this data (for example, competitors who may use this data in their own research and development programs) once this data is in the public domain. 
 
 We are also subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we undertake clinical trials. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data of EU individuals on our behalf. With each such provider we are required to enter into contractual arrangements under which they are contractually obligated to only process personal data according to our instructions, and conduct diligence to ensure that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. 
 
 We are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on electronic marketing and cookies. The European Union is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation that will be directly implemented in the laws of each EU member state. While this e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018, it is still going through the European legislative process and the timing of its adoption remains unclear. 
 Corporate Compliance 
 In order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief People Officer oversee compliance training, education, auditing, and monitoring; enforce disciplinary guidelines for any infractions of our corporate polices; implement new policies and procedures; respond to any detected issues; and undertake corrective action procedures. Our controls address compliance with laws and regulations that govern public pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, the following: federal and state law, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; Nasdaq listing requirements; the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC, the FDA, and HHS; and applicable laws and regulations administered by foreign regulatory authorities, including those of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Our standard operating procedures are designed to provide a framework for corporate governance in accordance with ethical standards and best legal practices.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our stock involves risks. You should carefully read this entire report and consider the following uncertainties and risks, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, along with all of the other information included in our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 
 Risks Relating to COVID-19 
 
 Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on us or on third parties with whom we conduct business, including without limitation our development partners, manufacturers, CROs, and others, as well as on the regulatory and government agencies with whom we work. 
 
 The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the United States and global economies, and could cause disruptions to our business, operations, and clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, as well as the business and operations of third parties with whom we conduct business. For example, government orders and evolving business policies and procedures have impacted and may continue to impact, among other things: (1) our personnel and those of third parties on whom we rely, including our development partners (such as Torii), manufacturers, CROs, and others; (2) the conduct of our current and future clinical trials and commercial interactions; and (3) the operations of the FDA, EMA, PMDA, and other health and governmental authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including as we continue to expand internationally and bring ORLADEYO to additional global markets. 
 
 If our operations or those of third parties with whom we conduct business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be stopped or delayed, or the costs of such development and commercialization activities could increase, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, our suppliers or other vendors may be unable to meet their obligations to us or perform their services as expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics. In such circumstances, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Such delays could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any commercialization timelines. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these challenges or delays will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 In addition, our clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the acceleration of COVID-19 slowed the startup of the inadequate C5 responder cohorts in our complement oral Factor D program and, as a result, delayed the reporting of related data in 2020. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a pandemic. Some patients may have difficulty following certain aspects of clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our inability to successfully recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 or experience additional restrictions by their institutions, city, or state could adversely impact our clinical trial operations. 
 
 If global health concerns prevent the FDA, EMA, PMDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of such authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and clinical development and commercialization plans and timelines. 
 
 Where possible and practical, we continue to provide work-from-home flexibility for our employees, which could negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines. In addition, we are a government contractor, and as such, we are subject to the federal COVID-19 safety protocols. We cannot accurately predict the impact on operations of any return-to-the-office plan, nor of the federal COVID-19 safety protocols on our business or on third parties with whom we conduct business. Our business may be negatively impacted in the event that large numbers 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 of employees or key employees do not comply with these protocols. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions to our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 The spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, could also materially affect our access to capital. While the future economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic could result in further significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access the equity or debt capital markets or obtain other sources of capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. 
 
 The global pandemic continues to evolve, with the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic being uncertain and subject to change. These effects could be material, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. We do not yet know the full extent and magnitude of the impacts that COVID-19 has had or will have on our business, the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, or the global economy. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. 
 Financial and Liquidity Risks 
 We have incurred losses since our inception, expect to continue to incur such losses, and may never be profitable. 
 Since our inception, we have not achieved sustained profitability. We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts and commercial activities progress. We expect that such losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that losses and fluctuations may be substantial. To become profitable, we, or our collaborative partners, must successfully manufacture and develop products and product candidates, receive regulatory approvals, and successfully commercialize our products and/or enter into profitable commercialization arrangements with other parties. It could take longer than expected before we receive, or we may never receive, significant revenue from any current or future license agreements or significant revenues directly from product sales. Even if we are able to successfully commercialize our existing products, or to develop or otherwise acquire new commercially viable products, certain obligations we have to third parties, including, without limitation, our obligation to pay RPI and OMERS, as applicable, royalties on certain revenues from ORLADEYO and BCX10013 under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, may reduce the profitability of such products. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product candidates, launching new products, and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. 
 We may need to raise additional capital in the future. If we are unable to raise capital as and when needed, we may need to adjust our operations. 
 We have sustained operating losses for the majority of our corporate history and expect that our 2023 expenses will exceed our 2023 revenues. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows unless and until revenues reach a level sufficient to support ongoing operations. 
 In order to continue future operations, progress our drug discovery and development programs, and commercialize our current products and product candidates, we may be required to raise additional capital. In addition to seeking strategic partnerships and transactions, we may access the equity or debt markets, incur additional borrowings, pursue royalty or other monetization transactions, or seek other sources of funding to meet liquidity needs at any time, including to take advantage of attractive opportunities in the capital markets. Additional funding, whether through additional sales of securities, additional borrowings, royalty or other monetization transactions, collaborative arrangements with partners, including corporate partners such as Torii, or from other sources, may not be available when needed or in a form or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of our currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. Additional borrowings may subject us to more restrictive covenants than are currently applicable to us under our Credit Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Co-Invest 1 LP Athyrium and such agreement, as amended, the Credit Agreement ). In addition, collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to our corporate partners. Insufficient funds or lack of an acceptable partnership may require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs. See Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization If we fail to obtain

Table of Contents 

 additional financing or acceptable partnership arrangements as and when needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or continue operations in this section for further discussion of the capital requirements for our development and commercialization efforts. 
 Our liquidity needs will largely be determined by the success of operations in regard to the commercialization of our products, particularly ORLADEYO, and the progression of our product candidates in the future. Our plans for managing our liquidity needs primarily include controlling the timing and spending on our research and development programs, raising additional funds as discussed herein, and commercializing our approved products. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information about our liquidity needs, capital requirements, potential funding alternatives, and adequacy of available funds. 
 There can be no assurance that any of our plans will be successful or that additional capital will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all, when needed. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital as and when needed, we may be forced to adjust or curtail our operations; delay, reduce, or stop ongoing clinical trials or commercialization efforts; cease operations altogether; or file for bankruptcy. 
 Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization 
 Our success depends upon our ability to manage our product candidate pipeline, advance our product candidates through the various stages of development, especially through the clinical trial process, and to receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates. 
 The success of our business depends upon our ability to manage our product candidate pipeline, including through expanding the pipeline, as appropriate, through our internal identification and discovery of product candidates or otherwise in-licensing or acquiring products or product candidates and integrating them into our business effectively and efficiently; advancing our product candidates through the various stages of development; and receiving regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates. Identifying, selecting, and in-licensing or acquiring products or product candidates requires substantial expense and technical and financial expertise, and if we are unable to effectively manage our pipeline and integrate viable products or product candidates into our business on acceptable terms, or at all, our business and drug development efforts would suffer. 
 To receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we or our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product candidate is safe and effective. The development process and related regulatory process are complex and uncertain. The preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of drug development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy and safety, failure to demonstrate adequate benefit-risk balance, failure to achieve a commercially attractive and competitive product label, failure to achieve approval in commercially attractive indications, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, our or our partners failure to comply with trial protocols, applicable regulatory requirements, or industry standards, or a determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or be approved in accordance with our development plans or at all. We cannot guarantee that any preclinical studies and clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, or that the results of such trials will be sufficient to support regulatory approval for our product candidates. 
 Progression of our product candidates through the clinical development process is dependent upon our trials indicating that our product candidates have adequate safety and efficacy in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined safety and efficacy endpoints according to the clinical trial protocols, and adequate benefit-risk profile. Failure to achieve any of these endpoints or to show adequate benefit-risk profile in any of our programs, including our complement program (inclusive of BCX10013) and our other rare disease product candidates, could result in delays in or modifications to our trials or require the performance of additional unplanned trials. For example, recent dose-related observations in an ongoing BCX10013 nonclinical study will delay the clinical program. If any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a benefit-risk perspective. Product candidates that initially show promise in clinical or preclinical testing could later be found to be associated with or to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that could result in substantial modifications or delays in the development plans for 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 our product candidates, significant unexpected costs, or the termination of programs, such as we experienced with BCX9930 in 2022 prior to discontinuing its development later that year. 
 In addition, the development plans for our product candidates, including our clinical trials (including for BCX10013), may not be adequately designed or executed, which could negatively affect the outcome and analysis of study results. Because of the cost and duration of clinical trials, we have decided in the past, and may in the future decide, to discontinue development of product candidates for various reasons, including, but not limited to, that they are unlikely to show favorable results in clinical trials, unlikely to help advance a product to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have reasonable commercial potential. 
 Undesirable or inconclusive data in our preclinical studies and clinical trials or side effects in humans could result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities (including, e.g., the EMA, the MHLW or the MHRA) refusing to approve a product candidate for any targeted indications or imposing restrictions or warnings that could impact development or the ultimate commercial viability of a product candidate. In addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may determine that study data from our product candidates necessitates additional studies or study designs which differ from our planned development strategy, and such regulatory authorities may also require patient monitoring and testing or may implement restrictions or other conditions on our development activities, any of which could materially impact the cost and timing of our planned development strategy. We, our partners, the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities have previously, and may again in the future, pause enrollment in, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks. 
 Our ability to complete the clinical development process successfully is dependent upon many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 our or our partners ability to secure suitable clinical sites and investigators and to enroll and maintain an adequate number of patients on a timely basis or at all; 
 patients that enroll in a clinical trial may not comply with the clinical trial protocol or maintain contact with investigators to provide complete data during and after treatment; 
 our product candidates may not prove to be either safe or effective or may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results; 
 we or our partners may decide, or be required by regulatory authorities, to pause enrollment in, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate, noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate; 
 regulatory authorities may disagree with our or our partners clinical trial protocols or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
 clinical protocols or study procedures may not be adequately designed or followed by the investigators; 
 formulation improvements may not work as expected, which could negatively impact commercial demand for our product candidates; 
 regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our partners enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies; 
 the supply or quantity of raw materials or manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct development activities may be insufficient, inadequate, or unavailable at an acceptable cost, and we or our partners may experience interruptions in supply; 
 our or our partners development plans may be delayed or changed as a result of changes in development strategy, the impact of new or different regulations, requirements, and guidelines, or other unexpected events or conditions; 
 the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; 
 we or our third-party contractors, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof, or conducting clinical trials or laboratory testing on our or our partners behalf, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards or meet contractual obligations in a timely manner or at all; and 
 the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on one or more of the foregoing factors. 
 Clinical trials are lengthy and expensive. Many of the factors listed above could result in increased clinical development costs or longer clinical development times for any of our programs. We and our partners incur substantial 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 expense for, and devote significant time to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet we cannot be certain that the tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product. Even if we or our partners successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates, we or our partners might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner or may not receive regulatory approval for the product candidates, which in either case would adversely impact or preclude our ability to generate any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements. In addition, any product candidate, if approved, may be subject to restrictions on labeling, marketing, distribution, prescribing, and use, which could adversely impact the sales of such product. 
 If our development collaborations with third parties, such as our development partners, contractors and contract research organizations, fail, the development of our product candidates will be delayed or stopped. 
 We rely heavily upon third parties for many important stages of our product candidate development, including, but not limited to: 
 discovery of natural proteins that cause or enable biological reactions necessary for the progression of the disease or disorder, called enzyme targets; 
 execution of certain pharmacology preclinical studies and late-stage development for our compounds and product candidates; 
 management of our phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials, including medical monitoring, laboratory testing, and data management; 
 execution of toxicology studies that may be required to obtain approval for our product candidates; 
 formulation improvement strategies and methods; 
 manufacturing the starting materials and drug substance required to formulate our products and the product candidates to be used in our clinical trials, toxicology studies and any potential commercial product; and 
 management of certain regulatory interactions outside of the United States. 
 Our failure to engage in successful collaborations at any one of these stages would greatly impact our business. If we do not license enzyme targets or inhibitors from academic institutions or from other biotechnology companies on acceptable terms, or at all, our drug development efforts would suffer. Similarly, if the contract research organizations or third-party contractors that conduct our initial or late-stage clinical trials, conduct our toxicology or other studies, manufacture our starting materials, drug substance and product candidates, provide laboratory testing or other services in connection with our clinical trials, or assist with our regulatory function breach their obligations to us, perform their services inconsistent with industry standards, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, this would delay or prevent both the development of our product candidates and the availability of any potential commercial product. 
 If we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider may need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original provider. In addition, any provider that we retain will be subject to applicable FDA current Good Laboratory Practices, cGMP, and current Good Clinical Practices, and comparable foreign standards. We do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. If any of the foregoing risks is realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 If we fail to obtain additional financing or acceptable partnership arrangements as and when needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or continue operations. 
 As our programs advance, our costs are likely to increase. Our current and planned discovery, development, approval, and commercialization efforts will require significant capital. Our expenses, revenues and cash utilization rate could vary significantly depending on many factors, including: our ability to effectively manage our product candidate pipeline; our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, including BCX10013; our ability to maintain regulatory approvals for, successfully commercialize, and achieve market acceptance of our products, including ORLADEYO; our ability to raise additional capital; the amount of funding we receive from partnerships with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates (including our collaboration with Torii); the commercial success of our products achieved by our partners; the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our product candidates; and the progress made in the manufacture of our lead products and the progression of our other programs. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 In order to continue future operations, progress our drug discovery and development programs, and commercialize our current products and product candidates, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital as and when needed, or at all, may be limited and may greatly depend upon our success in commercializing and achieving market acceptance of ORLADEYO and the success of our current drug development programs, including the progress, timeline and ultimate outcome of the development programs (including, but not limited to, formulation progress, long-term human safety studies, clinical trial investigations, and carcinogenicity, drug-drug interaction, toxicity, or other required studies) for our complement program (including BCX10013) for diseases of the complement system and other rare disease product candidates, as well as any post-approval studies for our products. In addition, constriction and volatility in the equity and debt markets, including as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, rising inflation or increased interest rates, may restrict our future flexibility to raise capital when such needs arise. See Risks Relating to Our Business Financial and Liquidity Risks We may need to raise additional capital in the future. If we are unable to raise capital as and when needed, we may need to adjust our operations in this section and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this report for additional information about our liquidity risks and capital requirements. 
 Furthermore, we have exposure to many different industries, financing partners and counterparties, including commercial banks, investment banks and partners (which include investors, licensing partners, distribution partners, and others), which may be unstable or may become unstable in the current economic and political environment, including as a result of the impacts of COVID-19, rising inflation, increased interest rates, or the conflict in Ukraine. Any such instability may impact these parties ability to fulfill contractual obligations to us, or it might limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us. Also, it is possible that suppliers may be negatively impacted. Any such unfavorable outcomes in our current programs or unfavorable economic conditions have in the past and could again place severe downward pressure on the price of our common stock and may decrease opportunities to raise capital in the capital or credit markets, and further could reduce the return available on invested corporate cash, which, if severe and sustained, could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and limit our ability to continue development and commercialization of our products and product candidates. 
 If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates or maintain regulatory approvals for our products, we or our partners will not be able to commercialize and sell these products and potential products, which would significantly harm our business because we will receive no revenue. 
 We or our partners must obtain regulatory approvals before marketing or selling our products. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority delays or denies regulatory approval of one of our product candidates, or revokes approval of a previously approved product, we would be unable to market or sell the product in the applicable jurisdiction and would not receive revenue from sales or licensing arrangements related thereto, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. 
 The process of preparing for and obtaining regulatory approval in any jurisdiction may be lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent to the development process, including risks and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19, our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. As discussed under Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization Our success depends upon our ability to manage our product candidate pipeline, advance our product candidates through the various stages of development, especially through the clinical trial process, and to receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we or our partners have experienced, and may again in the future experience, any number of unfavorable outcomes during or as a result of preclinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates, or negatively impact our management s credibility, our value and our operating results. 
 Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve a product candidate, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product candidate, impose other restrictions on the product candidate, and/or may require post-approval studies that could impair the commercial viability of a product candidate. Even upon any approval to market our potential products, whether in the United States or internationally, we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. 
 Our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements for regulatory approval, or our loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals, could impair our ability to generate any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 We focus on rare diseases, which may create additional risks and challenges. 
 Because we focus on developing drugs as treatments for rare diseases, we may seek orphan drug, breakthrough therapy or fast track designations for our product candidates in the United States or the equivalent designations elsewhere in the world. Often, regulatory authorities have broad discretion in determining whether or not to grant such designations. We cannot guarantee that our product candidates will receive orphan drug status from the FDA or equivalent designations from other regulatory authorities. We also cannot guarantee that we will receive breakthrough therapy, fast track, or equivalent designations, which provide certain potential benefits such as more frequent meetings with the applicable regulatory authorities to discuss development plans, intensive guidance on efficient drug development programs, and potential eligibility for rolling review or priority review. Even if we are successful in obtaining any such designations for our product candidates, such designations may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval and do not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may not be able to obtain or maintain these designations for our product candidates that receive them, and our competitors may obtain these designations for their product candidates, which could impact our ability to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates or compete with such competitors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The commercial viability of any approved product could be compromised if the product is less effective than expected, causes undesirable side effects that either were not previously identified or worse than expected, or fails to achieve market acceptance within the medical community. 
 If, after obtaining regulatory approval of a product, we or others discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that either were not previously identified or worse than expected, any of the following adverse events could occur: 
 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of, or impose marketing or manufacturing restrictions on, the product, or require us or our partners to create a medication guide outlining the risks of unidentified side effects for distribution to patients; 
 we or our partners may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties; and 
 the product may become less competitive and our reputation may suffer. 
 Even after receiving regulatory approval, any product could fail to gain sufficient, or any, market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, health authorities and others in the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch therapies due to lack of reimbursement for existing therapies. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, it may not generate significant revenues. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse impact on our business. 
 If we fail to successfully commercialize or establish collaborative relationships to commercialize certain of our products and product candidates, or if any partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, potential revenues from commercialization of our products and product candidates could be reduced, delayed or eliminated. 
 Our business strategy includes increasing the asset value of our product and product candidate portfolio. We believe this is best achieved by retaining full product rights or through collaborative arrangements with third parties as appropriate. As needed, potential third-party relationships could relate to preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval, marketing, sales, and distribution of our products and product candidates. 
 Currently, we have established collaborative relationships, including with Torii for the commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan, with third-party distributors for ORLADEYO in certain other markets, and with each of Shionogi 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 and Green Cross for the development and commercialization of peramivir. The process of establishing and implementing collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty, including: 
 we or our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate our relationships due to unsatisfactory commercial, regulatory or clinical results, including post-approval clinical commitments, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons; 
 our contracts for collaborative arrangements may expire; 
 the possibility that expiration or termination of collaborative relationships, such as those with certain of our distribution partners, may trigger repurchase obligations of the Company for unsold product held by our partners; 
 our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies, including those of our competitors; 
 we have had in the past, and in the future may have, disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration, which could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of our management; 
 we do not have day-to-day control over the activities of our partners and have limited control over their decisions; 
 our ability to generate future event payments and royalties from our partners depends upon their abilities to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of products developed from our product candidates; 
 we or our partners may fail to properly initiate, maintain or defend our intellectual property rights, where applicable, or a party may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; 
 we or our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources toward our products and product candidates; and 
 we or our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements. 
 If we or our partners fail to fulfill our responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, our development and commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be reduced, delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our partner. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms, we may have to delay or discontinue further development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates, undertake commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of funding. Any delay in the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates would severely affect our business, because if our product candidates do not progress through the development process or reach the market in a timely manner, or at all, or if our products do not achieve market success, we may not receive any revenues from product sales or licensing arrangements. 
 The results of our partnership with Torii may not meet our current expectations. 
 We have an agreement with Torii for the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan. Our ability to realize the expected benefits of this collaboration, including with respect to the receipt or amounts of royalty payments, is subject to a number of risks, including that the commercial potential of ORLADEYO may not meet our current expectations, we or Torii may fail to comply with our respective obligations under the Torii Agreement, and third parties may fail to perform their obligations to us on a timely basis or at all. 
 The Torii Agreement provides that we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, the amounts of which will depend upon the amount of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year and other factors. We currently remain responsible for regulatory activities with respect to ORLADEYO in Japan, and we continue to use third parties to satisfy many of our obligations under the Torii Agreement, including, but not limited to, our regulatory and other responsibilities in Japan. If our interactions, or those of our third-party agents, are unsuccessful, we could fail to meet our obligations under the Torii Agreement, which could negatively impact the commercial success and the partnership, impact the economic benefit expected or require additional development of ORLADEYO. 
 Torii may terminate the Torii Agreement under certain limited circumstances, including upon one year s written notice after the sixth anniversary of the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan. If the Torii Agreement is terminated in connection with these provisions, or at all, we will no longer be entitled to receive any milestone or royalty payments thereunder, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 Torii has sole control over, and decision-making authority with respect to, commercialization activities for ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan, subject to oversight from a joint steering committee. Therefore, 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 our receipt, and the amounts, of any royalty payments under the Torii Agreement are dependent upon Torii s successful performance of such commercialization activities. In addition, competitive products and variations in patient demand, prescription levels, reimbursement determinations or other factors may limit the commercial potential of ORLADEYO in Japan, which could materially reduce the amount of any royalties we are entitled to receive under the Torii Agreement. 
 Under the Torii Agreement, we are responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO for commercial sale. If, due to the failure of our third-party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient drug product, we fail to supply to Torii the required amounts of ORLADEYO, then Torii s ability to successfully commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan could be materially impaired, and we may receive less royalty income under the Torii Agreement, or none at all. 
 Any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations under the Torii Agreement, which could materially reduce the economic benefits of the Torii Agreement to us and impair or result in the termination of our collaboration with Torii. 
 There can be no assurance that our or our partners commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain. 
 There can be no assurance that our or our partners commercialization efforts, methods and strategies will succeed. We may be unable to establish or sufficiently increase our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for products we currently, or plan to, commercialize. Our ability to receive revenue from products we or our partners commercialize is subject to several risks, including: 
 we or our partners may fail to complete clinical trials successfully, or satisfy post-marketing commitments, sufficient to obtain and maintain regulatory agency marketing approval; 
 many competitors are more experienced and have significantly more resources, and their products could reach the market faster, be more cost effective or have a better efficacy or tolerability profile than our products and product candidates; 
 we may fail to employ a comprehensive and effective intellectual property strategy, which could result in decreased commercial value of our Company, our products and product candidates, or royalties associated with such products (e.g., the loss of the peramivir patent in Korea, which may result in a reduced royalty from Green Cross); 
 we may fail to employ a comprehensive and effective regulatory strategy, which could result in a delay or failure in commercialization of our products; 
 our and our partners ability to successfully commercialize our products is affected by the competitive landscape, which cannot be fully known at this time; 
 revenue from product sales depends on our ability to obtain and maintain favorable pricing; 
 reimbursement is constantly changing, which could greatly affect usage of our products; 
 future revenue from product sales will depend on our ability to successfully complete clinical studies, obtain regulatory approvals, and manufacture, market, distribute and commercialize our approved drugs; and 
 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or our partners. 
 In addition, future revenue from sales of ORLADEYO is subject to uncertainties and will depend on several factors, including the success of our and our partners commercialization efforts in the United States and elsewhere, the number of new patients switching to ORLADEYO, patient retention and demand, the number of physicians prescribing ORLADEYO, the rate of monthly prescriptions, reimbursement from third-party and government payors, the conversion of patients from our clinical trials and early access programs to commercial customers, our pricing strategy, and market trends. 
 Even if we are able to successfully commercialize our existing products, or to develop new commercially viable products, certain obligations we have to third parties, including, without limitation, our obligations to pay royalties on certain revenues from ORLADEYO and BCX10013 under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, may reduce the profitability of such products. 
 We have expanded, and may continue expanding, our development and regulatory capabilities and implementing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations in the United States and internationally, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 affairs, sales, marketing, and distribution. To manage our growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems and processes, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, implement appropriate systems and processes in a timely manner or at all, or recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. In addition, if a commercial launch for any product or product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities in any region is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. 
 We depend on third-party vendors in the manufacture and distribution of our products, product candidates and the materials for our products and product candidates. If we cannot rely on existing third-party vendors, we will be required to incur significant costs and potential delays in finding new third-party vendors, which could adversely impact the development and commercialization timeframes for our products and product candidates. 
 We depend on third-party vendors, including third-party manufacturers, distributors, and specialty pharmacies, in the manufacture and distribution of our products, product candidates, and the materials for our products and product candidates. Often, especially in the early development and commercialization process, we have only one or limited sources for a particular product or service, such as manufacturing and/or distribution. We depend on these third-party vendors to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable governmental regulations. Our third-party vendors, particularly our third-party manufacturers and distributors, each of which may be the only vendor we have engaged for a particular product, product candidate, or service or in a particular region, may encounter difficulties with meeting our requirements, including, but not limited to, problems involving, as applicable: 
 insufficient resources being devoted in the manner necessary to satisfy our requirements within expected timeframes; 
 inconsistent production yields; 
 product liability claims or recalls of commercial product; 
 difficulties in scaling production to commercial and validation sizes; 
 interruption of the delivery of materials required for the manufacturing process; 
 failure to distribute commercial supplies of our products to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner; 
 scheduling of plant time with other vendors or unexpected equipment failure; 
 potential catastrophes that could strike their facilities or have an effect on infrastructure; 
 potential impurities in our drug substance or products that could affect availability of product for our clinical trials or future commercialization; 
 poor quality control and assurance or inadequate process controls; 
 failure to provide us with accurate or timely information regarding inventories, the number of patients who are using our products, or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products; 
 inability of third parties to satisfy their financial obligations to us or to others; 
 potential breach of the manufacturing or distribution agreement by the third party; 
 possible termination or nonrenewal of a critical agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us; and 
 lack of compliance or cooperation with regulations and specifications or requests set forth by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies or local customs, particularly associated with ORLADEYO, BCX10013, peramivir and our early-stage compounds. 
 Many additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of any of our products and product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, pandemics, labor disputes or shortages, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, raw material shortages or supply chain issues. If our commercial distribution partners are not able to satisfy our requirements within the expected timeframe, or are unable to provide us with accurate or timely information and data, including with respect to inventories and sales, serious adverse events, and/or product complaints, our business, including our commercialization efforts for and sales of ORLADEYO, may be at risk. In addition, if specialty pharmacy services, including our third-party call center services, which provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support, are not effectively managed, the continuance of our commercialization efforts for and sales of ORLADEYO, may be delayed or compromised. 
 33

 In addition, our contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture the materials required for our products or product candidates at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Our raw materials, drug substances, products, and product candidates are manufactured by a limited group of suppliers, including some at a single facility. If any of these suppliers were unable to produce these items, this could significantly impact our supply of products and product candidate material for further preclinical testing and clinical trials. Our third-party manufacturers also may not meet our manufacturing requirements. Furthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the drug is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior review and approval in accordance with the FDA s cGMP and comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may at any time implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to comply, we or they may be subject to regulatory action, civil actions or penalties, any of which could be costly to us and could result in a delay or shortage of product. 
 If we are unable to maintain current third-party relationships, or enter into new agreements with additional third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or if there is poor manufacturing or distribution performance or failure to comply with any regulatory agency on the part of any of our third-party vendors, we may not be able to complete development of, obtain timely approval of, or commercialize our products and product candidates. 
 Commercialization of our products by us and our partners is subject to the potential commercialization risks described herein and numerous additional risks. Any potential revenue benefits to us, including in the form of milestone payments, royalties or other consideration are highly speculative. 
 Commercial success of our products is uncertain and is subject to all the risks and uncertainties disclosed in our other risk factors relating to drug development and commercialization. In addition, commercialization of our products is subject to further risks and may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 our products may not prove to be adequately safe and effective for market approval in markets other than the markets in which they are currently approved; 
 necessary funding for post-marketing commitments and further development of our products may not be available timely, at all, or in sufficient amounts; 
 advances in competing products could substantially replace potential demand for our products; 
 government and third-party payors may not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement, which would negatively impact the demand for our products; 
 we may not be able to supply commercial material to our partners and our partners may not be able to maintain or establish sufficient and acceptable commercial manufacturing, either directly or through third-party manufacturers; 
 the commercial demand and acceptance for our products by healthcare providers and by patients may not be sufficient to result in substantial product revenues to us or to our partners and may result in little to no revenue, milestone payments, or royalties to us; 
 effectiveness of marketing and commercialization efforts for our products by us or our partners; 
 market satisfaction with existing alternative therapies; 
 perceived efficacy relative to other available therapies; 
 disease prevalence; 
 cost of treatment; 
 our pricing and reimbursement strategy may not be effective; 
 pricing and availability of imports or alternative products; 
 marketing and sales activities of competitors; 
 shifts in the medical community to new treatment paradigms or standards of care; and 
 relative convenience and ease of administration. 
 Risks Relating to Competing in Our Industry 
 We face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products may be reduced. 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change. There are many companies seeking to develop products for the same indications that we currently target. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies and specialized biotechnology firms. Most of these competitors have greater 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 resources than we do, including greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and more experienced manufacturing, marketing, and sales organizations. In addition, most of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals of product candidates more rapidly than we do for products that compete with our products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including patent and FDA exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market products. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the commercialization of our products, licensing of potential product candidates for desirable disease targets, licensing of desirable product candidates, and development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Competition may also arise from, among other things: 
 other drug development technologies; 
 methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and 
 new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. 
 Developments by others may render our products, product candidates, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 We received FDA approval of ORLADEYO, an oral, once-daily therapy for the prevention of HAE attacks in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, in December 2020. We subsequently received regulatory approvals for ORLADEYO in multiple markets. In addition, we are performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several other rare diseases, including diseases of the complement system. We expect to encounter significant competition for our pharmaceutical products and product candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required funding or government support, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales or stockpiling orders of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. In addition, various government entities throughout the world may offer incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment into certain preventative and therapeutic agents, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors. See Business Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further discussion of our competitors, competitive products or programs, and the competitive conditions in these and other therapeutic areas. 
 If one or more of our competitors products or programs, including potential competitors not currently identified, are successful, the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated. 
 Compared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater: 
 capital resources; 
 research and development resources, including personnel and technology; 
 regulatory experience; 
 preclinical study and clinical testing experience; 
 manufacturing, marketing, and sales experience; and 
 production facilities. 
 Any of these competitive factors could impede our funding efforts, render our products, product candidates, or technologies noncompetitive or eliminate or reduce demand for our products and product candidates. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations related to our products and product candidates, and if we or our partners do not comply with these laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties. 
 Our and our partners activities related to approved products or, following their regulatory approval (if applicable), any of our product candidates under development, such as BCX10013, are subject to regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States (including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice DOJ ), and state and local governments) and their foreign equivalents (including the EMA, MHLW, MHRA, and others). 
 We are responsible for reporting adverse drug experiences, have responsibility for certain post-approval studies, and may have responsibilities and costs related to a recall or withdrawal of our products from sale in the jurisdictions in which 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 they are approved. We may also incur liability associated with product manufacturing contracted by us or in support of any of our partners. We are required to maintain records and provide data and reports to regulatory agencies related to our products (e.g. risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, track and trace requirements, and adverse events), and we may incur certain promotional regulatory and government pricing risks, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. Similar responsibilities would apply upon regulatory approval of any of our other product candidates currently under development. 
 In addition, we are subject to the federal physician sunshine act and certain similar physician payment and drug pricing transparency legislation in various states. We are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including both federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. Outside of the United States, we may be subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations apply to our and our partners operations, sales and marketing practices, price reporting, and relationships with physicians and other customers and third-party payors. Although we seek to comply with these statutes, it is possible that our practices, or those of our partners, might be challenged under healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims or similar laws. Violations of the physician sunshine act and similar legislation or the fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and future exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. 
 The principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to certain regulatory authorities, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Consequently, the FDA or other regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator creates a conflict of interest or otherwise affects interpretation of the study. In the event of a conflict of interest with respect to a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned or the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates. 
 The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may also impose post-approval commitments on us for approved products, which we may not complete successfully or on time for any number of reasons, including but not limited to lack of funds to complete the studies and insufficient interest by appropriate sites, investigators or study subjects. We are currently subject to certain post-approval commitments. If we fail to comply with post-approval legal and regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties, and our products could be subject to continual recordkeeping and reporting requirements, review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Regulatory approval of a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the other restrictive conditions of approval that limit our ability to promote, sell or distribute a product. Furthermore, the approval of our products and any other future product candidates may be subject to requirements for costly post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor their safety or efficacy. 
 Advertising and promotion are subject to stringent FDA rules and oversight, and as an NDA holder, we may be held responsible for any advertising and promotion that is not in compliance with the rules and regulations. Applicable regulatory authorities, competitors, and other third parties may take the position that we are not in compliance with such regulations. In addition to medical education efforts, we may offer patient support services to assist patients receiving treatment with our commercially approved products which have increasingly become the focus of government investigation. 
 Adverse event information concerning approved products must be reviewed, and as an NDA holder, we are required to make expedited and periodic adverse event reports to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the HHS, the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, state and local governments, and foreign equivalents of the foregoing. All of these activities are also potentially subject to healthcare false claims and fraud and abuse laws, as well as consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations with respect to our products that are subject to healthcare laws and regulations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws described above or in Business Government Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this report or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with all applicable fraud and abuse laws may be costly. 
 Our employees, consultants and partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation. 
 We are subject to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, consultants and partners, including intentional or unintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable other regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable other regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable other regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee and consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and consultant misconduct, whether intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 
 We and our partners may be subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and healthcare payor initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our or our partners ability to market our products, develop our product candidates, obtain collaborators and raise capital. 
 We are subject to new legislation, regulatory, and healthcare payor initiatives, including the PPACA, which made extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the United States, as discussed in Business Government Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose certain payments and transfers of value to, and investment interests held by, physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Compliance with the PPACA and state laws with similar provisions is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the applicable safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. For example, legislation has been enacted in certain states and at a federal level that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with these electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. In addition, our compliance may be deemed insufficient and we could face a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Adequate coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other markets is critical to the commercial success of our approved products. Recently in the United States, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA implements a number of drug pricing measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 reforms, including limits on price increases and subjecting an escalating number of drugs to annual price negotiations with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We cannot be sure whether additional legislation or rulemaking related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of our products or any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future. The effect of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Many third-party payors negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies which establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the third-party payor s patient population. The process for obtaining coverage can be lengthy and costly, and we expect that it could take several months before a particular payor initially reviews a product and makes a decision with respect to coverage. For example, third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data from us in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other product we might bring to market. For any individual third-party payor, we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain reimbursement on a similar or preferred basis to competitive products, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to data security and privacy risks, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business. 
 We are subject to legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use, and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. For example, we may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. We also may be subject to the GDPR in the EEA and similar legislation in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. See Business Government Regulation Data Privacy and Security Laws in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to International Operations Our actual or perceived failure to comply with European governmental laws and regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our business in this section for additional discussion of privacy laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, private litigation, or harm to our reputation and our business. 
 If, because of our use of hazardous materials, we violate any environmental controls or regulations that apply to such materials, we may incur substantial costs and expenses in our remediation efforts. 
 Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and some waste products. Accidental contamination or injury from these materials could occur. In the event of an accident, we could be liable for any damages that result, and any liabilities could exceed our resources. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations or a violation of such environmental laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Intellectual Property Risks 
 If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of those rights would diminish, and if we fail to secure the rights to patents of others, it could adversely affect our business. 
 Our success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our partners to obtain, protect and enforce viable intellectual property rights including, but not limited to, trade name, trademark and patent protection for our Company and its products, methods, processes and other technologies we may license or develop, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties both domestically and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), the Patent Cooperation Treaty offices, nor the courts of the United States and other jurisdictions have consistent policies nor predictable rulings regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Further, we may not have worldwide patent protection for all of our product candidates and our intellectual property rights may not be legally protected or enforceable in all countries throughout the 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 world. In some jurisdictions, some of our product candidates in certain programs, including our HAE program, may have short or no composition of matter patent life and we may therefore rely on orphan drug exclusivity or data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug exclusivity or data exclusivity in every jurisdiction. Further, in some jurisdictions, we may rely on formulation patents or method of use patents. Both the ability to achieve issuance and the enforcement of formulation and method of use patents can be highly uncertain and can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and such patents may therefore not adequately prevent competitors and potential infringers in some jurisdictions. The validity, scope, enforceability and commercial value of the rights protected by such patents, therefore, is highly uncertain. 
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborators and advisors, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled. 
 We may be involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our partners or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. 
 Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. An adverse result in any legal proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk. Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and other intellectual property rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our technologies and products. In the United States, patent applications filed in recent years are confidential for 18 months, while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result, avoiding patent infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents or proprietary rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our licensors that even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if resolved against us, could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even if we, our partners or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. 
 If we or our partners are unable or fail to adequately initiate, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights in any area of commercial interest or in any part of the world where we wish to seek regulatory approval for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, the value of our products and product candidates to produce revenue would diminish. Additionally, if our products, methods, processes, and other technologies or our commercial use of such products, processes, and other technologies, including, but not limited to, any trade name, trademark or commercial strategy infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs. The USPTO and the patent offices of other jurisdictions have issued to us a number of patents for our various inventions, and we have in-licensed several patents from various institutions. We have filed additional patent applications and provisional patent applications with the USPTO. We have filed a number of corresponding foreign patent applications and intend to file additional foreign and U.S. patent applications, as appropriate. We have also filed certain trademark and trade name applications worldwide. We cannot assure you as to: 
 the degree and range of protection any patents will afford against competitors with similar products; 
 if and when patents will issue; 
 if patents do issue, we cannot be sure that we will be able to adequately defend such patents and whether or not we will be able to adequately enforce such patents; or 
 whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications. 
 If the USPTO or other foreign patent office upholds patents issued to others or if the USPTO grants patent applications filed by others, we may have to: 
 obtain licenses or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; 
 stop using the subject matter claimed in those patents; or 
 pay damages. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 We may initiate, or others may bring against us, litigation or administrative proceedings related to intellectual property rights, including proceedings before the USPTO or other foreign patent office. Any judgment adverse to us in any litigation or other proceeding arising in connection with a patent or patent application could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs of any litigation or administrative proceeding may be substantial whether or not we are successful. 
 Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience, none of which is patentable, of our scientific and technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our Company and require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information, and if any of our proprietary information is disclosed, our business will suffer because our revenues depend upon our ability to license or commercialize our products and product candidates and any such events would significantly impair the value of such products and product candidates. 
 Product Liability Risks 
 We face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products or product candidates results in personal injury or death and our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient. 
 If the use or misuse of any products we sell, or a partner sells, harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payors or others. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials, including post-marketing clinical studies, could also expose us to product liability claims. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates, and therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. Even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business. 
 We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and face even greater risks upon commercialization by us of our products or product candidates. We have product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance or increase our existing coverage at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of our products or product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in: 
 liabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available; 
 an increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, or at all; 
 withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers or patients; 
 damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products, resulting in lower sales; 
 regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; 
 litigation costs; and 
 the diversion of management s attention from managing our business. 
 Risks Relating to Contractual Arrangements 
 We face risks related to our government-funded programs and are subject to various U.S. Government contract requirements, which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us. 
 We have contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including Marburg virus disease, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease. In contracting with these government agencies, we are subject to various U.S. Government contract requirements, including general 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 clauses for a cost-reimbursement research and development contract, which may limit our reimbursement. While all government funding for galidesivir expired in 2022, we still face risks related to our U.S. Government contracts. 
 U.S. Government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on U.S. Government contracts. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: 
 terminate or reduce the scope of our contract with or without cause; 
 interpret relevant regulations (federal acquisition regulation clauses); 
 require performance under circumstances which may not be favorable to us; 
 require an in-process review where the U.S. Government will review the project and its options under the contract; 
 control the timing and amount of funding, which impacts the development progress of our programs; and 
 audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. 
 Upon termination or expiration of a contract, the U.S. Government may dispute wind-down and termination costs and may question prior expenses under the contract and deny payment of those expenses. Should we choose to challenge the U.S. Government for denying certain payments under a contract, such a challenge could subject us to substantial additional expenses which we may or may not recover. 
 In addition, as a U.S. Government contractor, we are required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards relating to our accounting practices and are subject to periodic audits and reviews, including a final financial audit. As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. Government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Audits under the BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS galidesivir contracts may occur at the election of the U.S. Government and have been concluded through fiscal 2019; all subsequent fiscal years are still open and auditable. Based on the results of its audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. This adjustment could impact the amount of revenues reported on a historic basis. In addition, in the event BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS determines that certain costs and fees were unallowable or determines that the allocated indirect cost rate was higher than the actual indirect cost rate, BARDA/HHS or NIAID/HHS would be entitled to recoup any overpayment from us as a result. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs may not be reimbursable or allowed under our contracts. Further, as a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities as compared to private sector commercial companies. 
 There are risks related to the potential government use or sale of our antivirals. 
 Government use or sale, in emergency situations or otherwise, of our antivirals (including peramivir for the treatment of influenza) may result in risks to us or our collaborative partners. There can be no assurance that government use of our antivirals (whether as indicated or outside of their current indications) will prove to be generally safe, well-tolerated and effective. Any government sale or use (on an emergency basis or otherwise) of our antivirals in any country may create liabilities for us or our partners. 
 There can be no assurance that we or our manufacturers will be able to fully meet the demand for our antivirals with respect to any future arrangements. Further, we may not receive a favorable purchase price for future orders, if any, of our antivirals by governmental entities. Our competitors may develop products that could compete with or replace any antivirals selected for government sale or use. We may face competition in markets where we have no existing intellectual property protection or are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights. 
 There can be no assurance that the non-U.S. partnerships that we have entered into for peramivir will result in any order for peramivir in those countries or that peramivir will be approved for any use or will achieve market approval in additional countries. In the event that any emergency use or market approval is granted in any country, there can be no assurance that any government order or commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate in such countries will be substantial or will be profitable to us.

 If we fail to reach milestones or to make annual minimum payments or otherwise breach our obligations under our license agreements, our licensors may terminate our agreements with them and/or seek additional remedies. 
 If we are unable or fail to meet payment obligations, performance milestones relating to the timing of regulatory filings, product supply obligations, post-approval commitments, or development and commercial diligence obligations; are unable or fail to make milestone payments or material data use payments in accordance with applicable provisions; or fail to pay the minimum annual payments under any of our in-licenses relating to our products or product candidates, our licensors may terminate the applicable license and/or seek other available remedies. As a result, our development of the respective product candidate or commercialization of the product would cease. 
 Because continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub. As a result, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments, if any, that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we could otherwise be adversely affected. 
 In March 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Royalty Sub, issued 30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes are secured principally by (i) certain royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, pursuant to which Shionogi licensed from us the rights to market peramivir in Japan and Taiwan and (ii) the pledge by us of our equity interest in Royalty Sub. Payments, if any, from Shionogi to us on non-governmental sales under the Shionogi Agreement will generally not be available to us for other purposes unless and until Royalty Sub has repaid in full its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes. Accordingly, these funds have been and will continue to be required to be dedicated to Royalty Sub s debt service and not available to us for product development or other purposes. Since September 1, 2014, payments from Shionogi have been insufficient for Royalty Sub to service its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes, resulting in a continuing event of default with respect to the PhaRMA Notes since that time. In addition, the PhaRMA Notes had a final legal maturity date of December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of 30.0 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest of 20.6 million, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay these amounts at the maturity date constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. As Royalty Sub has been unable to service its obligations under the PhaRMA Notes and continuing events of default exist under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may be able to foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interest in Royalty Sub and may exercise other remedies available to them under the indenture or other documents related to the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments, if any, that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes, we may incur legal costs, and we might otherwise be adversely affected. 
 We cannot predict whether holders of PhaRMA Notes will seek to pursue any remedies as a result of the continuing events of default with respect to the PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes are the obligation of Royalty Sub. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential foreclosure, we believe the primary impact to us would be the loss of future royalty payments, if any, from Shionogi and the legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. As a result, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that we will not otherwise be adversely affected as a result the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes or the failure by Royalty Sub to repay the PhaRMA Notes at maturity. 
 We wrote off the balance due under the PhaRMA Notes to other income as a debt extinguishment as of December 31, 2021. See Note 8 Royalty Monetizations RAPIACTA Non-Recourse Notes Payable Debt Extinguishment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the write-off. 
 We have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our Credit Agreement contains conditions and restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be required to make a prepayment or repay our outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect if a prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding principal balance under our Credit Agreement of 240.5 million, inclusive of the quarterly PIK Interest Payments. We will be required to pay to Athyrium, for the account of the lenders, a make-whole premium plus certain fees set forth in the Credit Agreement in the event that we prepay or repay, or are required to prepay or repay, voluntarily or pursuant to a mandatory prepayment obligation under the Credit Agreement

 (e.g., with the proceeds of certain asset sales, certain ORLADEYO out-licensing or royalty monetization transactions (excluding the Royalty Sales), extraordinary receipts, debt issuances, or upon a change of control of the Company and specified other events, subject to certain exceptions), all of the then-outstanding Term Loans under the Credit Agreement, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
 Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it: 
 increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; 
 limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; 
 makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates; 
 requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes; 
 limits our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and 
 places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness. 
 Furthermore, our Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things, grant certain types of liens on our assets; make certain investments; incur or assume certain debt; engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, and similar transactions; dispose of assets; license certain property; distribute dividends; make certain restricted payments; change the nature of our business; engage in transactions with affiliates and insiders; prepay other indebtedness; or engage in sale and leaseback transactions. 
 The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain at all times at least 15.0 million (or, in certain circumstances, 20.0 million) of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we are required to achieve certain minimum targets for consolidated net revenues from ORLADEYO sales in the United States. 
 The covenants contained in the Credit Agreement could cause us to be unable to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial without the lenders permission or without repaying all outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default will also occur if, among other things, we fail to pay amounts due under the Credit Agreement, we fail to repay certain other indebtedness having an aggregate principal amount in excess of one percent of our borrowings under the Credit Agreement, a material adverse change in our business, assets, properties, liabilities, or condition occurs, or a material impairment of our ability to perform our obligations under the Credit Agreement occurs, we experience a change of control, certain negative regulatory events occur, including without limitation the loss of a required permit or a recall of a product, or we fail to make required payments under our Royalty Purchase Agreements. In the case of a continuing event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, proceed against the collateral in which we granted to the lenders a security interest, or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in, subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our assets. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement obligations, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. 
 Risks Relating to International Operations 
 International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks. 
 Our business strategy includes international expansion, including the commercialization of products outside of the United States. In addition, we currently conduct clinical studies and regulatory activities and have hired, and expect to 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 continue hiring, employees outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to: 
 multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy and data regulations, transparency regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses; 
 introduction of new health authority requirements and/or changes in health authority expectations; 
 failure by us or our partners to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries; 
 complexities and difficulties in obtaining and maintaining protection for, and enforcing, our intellectual property; 
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 
 complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems; 
 limits on our ability to penetrate international markets; 
 financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which have been increasingly prevalent alongside a fluctuating U.S. dollar; 
 natural disasters and political and economic instability, including wars (e.g., the conflict in Ukraine), terrorism, political unrest, results of certain elections and votes, actual or threatened public health emergencies and outbreak of disease (e.g., the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), boycotts, adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, and other business restrictions; 
 certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance; 
 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over commercial operations and activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions or anti-bribery provisions, or the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign laws and regulations; and 
 regulatory and compliance risks relating to doing business with any entity that is subject to sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
 Any of these factors could significantly harm our international expansion of operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Additionally, in some countries, such as Japan and the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
 We conduct operations in many countries outside of the United States involving transactions in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These transactions include, without limitation, commercial sales, contract manufacturing, and clinical trial activities. Although most of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, our commercial sales in Europe are primarily denominated in Euros and British Pounds. In addition, our royalties from Torii are derived from Torii s sales of ORLADEYO in Japan, which sales are denominated in Japanese yen and converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining the royalty owed to us. We also have foreign currency exposure to fluctuations in other foreign currencies, such as the Swiss Franc, Danish Krone, Swedish Krona, and the Canadian Dollar. Changes in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may impact our consolidated operating results, including our revenues and expenses, causing fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and/or resulting in foreign currency transaction losses that adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. As we continue to expand our operations internationally, our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses may become 
 44

 more significant. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this report for additional information about our foreign currency risk. 
 Our actual or perceived failure to comply with European governmental laws and regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security could harm our business. 
 EU member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other countries have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. These laws include the GDPR and similar national legislation, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, and the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC), and are discussed in more detail in Business Government Regulation Data Privacy and Security Laws in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR or related national data protection laws, which may deviate from the GDPR, may result in significant fines of up to 4 of global revenues, or 20.0 million, whichever is greater, and in addition to such fines, our failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR or similar national legislation may subject us to litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation and business. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we are required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the data protection rules. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, requires the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification throughout the European Union, imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with service providers and requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training and data audit. 
 We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the provision of our services, a number of which process personal data of EU individuals on our behalf. With each such provider, we are required to enter into contractual arrangements under which they are contractually obligated to only process personal data according to our instructions, and conduct diligence to ensure that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Compliance with the requirements imposed by the GDPR and other such laws can be time-consuming, expensive and difficult, and may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite our efforts we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our personnel, collaborators, partners or vendors do not comply with applicable data protection obligations. 
 We are also subject to evolving European privacy laws on electronic marketing and cookies. The European Union is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation that will be directly implemented in the laws of each EU member state. While this e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018, it is still going through the European legislative process and the timing of its adoption remains unclear. 
 The United Kingdom s decision to withdraw from the European Union could result in increased regulatory and legal complexity, which may make it more difficult for us to do business in Europe and impose additional challenges in securing regulatory approval of our product candidates in Europe. 
 The United Kingdom s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend in part on how the current and future trade agreements between the United Kingdom and the European Union take effect in practice. Changes in U.K. or EU regulations may cause disruption or delays in granting clinical trial authorization or opinions for marketing authorization, disruption of importation and export of active substance and other components of new drug formulations, and disruption of the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations. 
 The cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the European Union and/or the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which can disrupt the timing of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenues and achieve and sustain profitability. 
 In addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the European Union. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the absence of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have and how such withdrawal will affect us, and the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected. 
 Risks Relating to Technology 
 If our facilities, or the facilities of our third-party vendors, incur damage or power is lost for a significant length of time, our business will suffer. 
 We and our third-party vendors store commercial product, clinical and stability samples at our facilities that could be damaged if the facilities incur physical damage or in the event of an extended power failure. We have backup power systems in addition to backup generators to maintain power to all critical functions, but any loss of these products or samples could result in significant delays in our commercialization or drug development process. 
 In addition, we store most of our preclinical and clinical data at our facilities. Duplicate copies of most critical data are secured off-site. Any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose our data. Loss of data could result in significant delays in our drug development process, and any system failure could harm our business and operations. 
 A significant disruption in our or our third-party information technology systems or a cybersecurity breach could adversely affect our business. 
 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business. In addition, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities regulate, among other things, the record keeping and storage of data pertaining to potential pharmaceutical products. We currently store most of our preclinical research data, our clinical data and our manufacturing data at our facilities. While we do store duplicate copies of most of our clinical data offsite and a significant portion of our data is included in regular backups of our systems, we could lose important data if our facilities incur damage, or if our vendor data systems fail, suffer damage or are destroyed. In addition, we have outsourced significant parts of our information technology and business infrastructure to third-party providers, and we currently use these providers to perform business critical information technology and business services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents on the associated networks and systems, whether they are managed by us directly or by the third parties with whom we contract, and we have experienced and may in the future experience such cybersecurity threats and attacks. 
 Like other companies in our industry, our networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, foreign companies, or competitors, or may be breached by employee error, malfeasance or other disruption. These risks have increased as we have experienced significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations and as virtual and remote working have become more widely used, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction, or interruption of critical information technology systems could negatively impact operations. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any compromise of our data security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could harm our business. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of third parties with which we do business, and any such events could adversely affect our business.

 Risks Relating to Investing in Our Common Stock 
 Our existing principal stockholders hold a substantial amount of our common stock and may be able to influence significant corporate decisions, which may conflict with the interest of other stockholders. 
 Some of our stockholders own greater than 5 of our outstanding common stock. Our top ten stockholders own approximately 50 of our common stock and can individually, and as a group, influence our operations based upon their concentrated ownership and may also be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval of the stockholders, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. 
 Our stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline significantly. 
 The market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. Moreover, our stock price has fluctuated frequently, and these fluctuations are often not related to our financial results. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the 52-week range of the market price of our stock was from 7.61 to 19.99 per share. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have, and in some cases have had, a significant impact on the market price of our common stock: 
 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors; 
 developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights; 
 additional dilution through sales of our common stock or other derivative securities; 
 status of new or existing licensing or collaborative agreements and government contracts; 
 announcements relating to the status of our programs; 
 us or our partners achieving or failing to achieve development milestones; 
 publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors; 
 publicity regarding certain public health concerns for which we are or may be developing treatments; 
 regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries; 
 public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 
 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and the comparison of such estimates to our actual results; 
 changes in our public guidance; 
 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including developments in price control legislation; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other monetization transactions; 
 additions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors; 
 purchases or sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders, including officers or directors; 
 economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises; and 
 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. 
 This volatility could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock in the past have been subject to securities class action litigation. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Future sales and issuances of securities may dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and cause our stock price to decline. 
 Future sales of our common stock by us or our current stockholders into the public market could cause the market price of our stock to fall. As of January 31, 2023, there were 188,451,137 shares of our common stock outstanding. We may from time to time issue securities in relation to a license arrangement, collaboration, merger or acquisition. We may also sell, for our own account, shares of common stock or other equity securities, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 As of January 31, 2023, there were 34,992,042 stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and 4,254,957 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, 6,150,129 stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and 607,208 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, and 5,616,817 shares available for issuance under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, we could also make equity grants outside of our Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan or Amended and Restated Inducement Equity Incentive Plan. The shares underlying existing stock options, restricted stock units and possible future stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards have been registered pursuant to registration statements on Form S-8. 
 If some or all of such shares are sold or otherwise issued into the public market over a short period of time, our current stockholders ownership interests may be diluted and the value of all publicly traded shares is likely to decline, as the market may not be able to absorb those shares at then-current market prices. Additionally, such sales and issuances may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, or at all. 
 In March 2017, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with entities affiliated with Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the Baker Entities to provide that, if requested, we will register the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the Baker Entities for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Our registration obligations pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement cover all shares then held or thereafter acquired by the Baker Entities, for up to ten years, and include our obligation to facilitate certain underwritten public offerings of our common stock by the Baker Entities in the future. On May 10, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to 11,710,951 shares of common stock held by the Baker Entities. Subsequently, on November 21, 2019, certain of the Baker Entities acquired pre-funded warrants to purchase 11,764,706 shares of our common stock at a price of 1.69 per warrant, of which warrants to purchase 11,511,472 shares of our common stock remain outstanding. In addition, on June 1, 2020, we issued to certain of the Baker Entities pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,511,111 shares of our common stock at a price of 4.49 per warrant. Each warrant has an exercise price of 0.01 per share. If the Baker Entities, by exercising their registration rights or otherwise, sell a large number of our shares, or the market perceives that the Baker Entities intend to sell a large number of our shares, this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 We have anti-takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree. 
 Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. 
 In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and supermajority approval of the removal of any member of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent. Our Certificate of Incorporation also requires supermajority approval of any amendment of these provisions. These provisions and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws and of Delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. 
 We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. 
 We have never paid cash dividends on our stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which may limit a stockholder s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for such disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
 Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents arising out of or relating to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or our Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (iv) any action against us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to establish the Delaware Court of Chancery as the forum for actions or proceedings brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 
 This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to choose its preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits with respect to such claims. If a court were to find this exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another jurisdiction, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Natural disasters, epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks, trade wars, armed conflicts, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners, manufacturers, regulators or other third parties with whom we conduct business now or in the future. 
 A wide variety of events beyond our control, such as natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), epidemic or pandemic disease outbreaks (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), trade wars, armed conflict, political unrest or other events could disrupt our business or operations or those of our development partners (such as Torii), manufacturers, regulatory authorities, or other third parties with whom we conduct business. These events may cause businesses and government agencies to be shut down, supply chains to be interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and individuals to become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. If our operations or those of third parties with whom we conduct business are impaired or curtailed as a result of these events, the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be impaired or halted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. See, for example, Risk Factors General Risk Factors Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market and economic conditions. In addition, other events, such as the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could adversely impact our business. For example, the conflict could lead to sanctions, embargoes, supply shortages, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyber-attacks, other retaliatory actions, and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results, as well as those of third parties with whom we conduct business. 
 Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market and economic conditions. 
 Our business, operations, clinical development or commercialization plans and timelines, and access to capital could be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market and economic conditions, including as a result of rising inflation, increased interest rates, the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the conflict in Ukraine. The magnitude, duration and long-term effect of each of these factors, as well as the effects of actions taken by governments to address them, are unknown at this time, but they could result in further significant disruption of the global economy and financial markets. Our business may be adversely affected by any related economic downturn, volatile geopolitical and business environment, or continued market instability. 
 Unstable market and economic conditions could materially affect our ability to access the equity or debt capital markets or obtain other sources of capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. 
 Market and economic conditions continue to evolve, with the ultimate impacts being uncertain and subject to change. These effects could be material, and we will continue to monitor the economic climate, COVID-19 pandemic, and the conflict in Ukraine closely. We do not yet know the full extent and magnitude of the impacts that these developments will have on our business, on the healthcare system, or on the global economy. In addition, unstable market conditions could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section.

 We are subject to legal proceedings, which could harm our reputation or result in other losses or unexpected expenditure of time and resources. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in disputes, including, without limitation, disputes with our employees, collaborative partners, and third-party vendors. We may be called upon to initiate legal proceedings or to defend ourselves in such legal proceedings relating to our relationships with these parties, our decisions and actions or omissions with respect thereto, and our business. In addition, if our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities class action lawsuits in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainties in legal proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any current or future dispute resolution or legal proceeding, regardless of the merits of any such proceeding, could harm our reputation and result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. 
 Insurance coverage is increasingly more costly and difficult to obtain or maintain. 
 While we currently have insurance for our business, property, directors and officers, and our products, insurance is increasingly more costly and narrower in scope, and we may be required to assume more risk in the future. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage in excess of our insurance coverage, we will be required to bear any loss in excess of our insurance limits. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage that is outside of our insurance coverage, we may incur significant uninsured costs associated with loss or damage that could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Furthermore, any claims made on our insurance policies may impact our ability to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at reasonable costs or at all. 
 If we fail to retain our existing key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel, the development of our product candidates, the commercialization of our products, and the related expansion of our business will be delayed or stopped. 
 We are highly dependent upon our senior management and scientific team, the unexpected loss of whose services might impede the achievement of our development and commercial objectives. Competition for key personnel with the experience that we require is intense and is expected to continue to increase. Our inability to attract and retain the required number of skilled and experienced management, commercial, operational and scientific personnel would harm our business because we rely upon these personnel for many critical functions of our business.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report (including the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report and the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this report). 
 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company that discovers and commercializes novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry, and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. In addition to these discovery and development efforts, our business strategy includes the efficient commercialization of these drugs in the United States and certain other regions upon regulatory approval. By focusing on rare disease markets, we believe that we can more effectively control the costs of, and our strategic allocation of financial resources toward, post-approval commercialization. 
 Products and Product Candidates 
 ORLADEYO (berotralstat) . ORLADEYO is an oral, once-daily therapy discovered and developed by us for the prevention of hereditary angioedema HAE attacks. ORLADEYO is approved in the United States and multiple global markets for the prevention of HAE attacks in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. 
 We have built out our U.S. commercial infrastructure to support the launch and continued commercialization of ORLADEYO in the United States and are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support launches in other markets. Based on proprietary analyses of HAE prevalence and market research studies with HAE patients, physicians, and 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 payors in the United States and Europe, and two full years of commercialization experience with ORLADEYO in 2021 and 2022, we anticipate the global commercial market for ORLADEYO has the potential to reach a global peak of 1 billion in annual net ORLADEYO revenues. We expect at least 70 to 80 percent of our revenue at peak to come from the United States. These expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different. There can be no assurance that our commercialization methods and strategies will succeed, or that the market for ORLADEYO will develop in line with our current expectations. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization There can be no assurance that our or our partners commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks. 
 Revenue from sales of ORLADEYO in 2022, which was our second full year of ORLADEYO sales, is discussed under Results of Operations in this MD A. Revenue from sales of ORLADEYO in future periods is subject to uncertainties and will depend on several factors, including the success of our and our partners commercialization efforts in the United States and elsewhere, the number of new patients switching to ORLADEYO, patient retention and demand, the number of physicians prescribing ORLADEYO, the rate of monthly prescriptions, reimbursement from third-party and government payors, the conversion of patients from our clinical trials and early access programs to commercial customers, our pricing strategy, and market trends. We are continuing to monitor and analyze this data as we continue to commercialize ORLADEYO. In addition, because of typical first quarter requirements from payors for prescription reauthorization of specialty products, like ORLADEYO, that can temporarily move patients from paid drug to free product, copayment assistance and Medicare D cost sharing dynamics, we expect ORLADEYO net revenue in the first quarter of 2023 to be similar to, or slightly less than, the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Complement Program . The goal of our overall complement program is to advance several compounds across multiple pathways in the complement system to treat many complement-mediated diseases. These compounds include BCX10013, which targets the alternative pathway of complement. In addition, we are pursuing oral medicines directed at other targets across the classical, lectin, and terminal pathways of the complement system, including C2, a critical upstream serine protease enzyme for activation of the classical and lectin pathways. We have developed potent, selective molecules targeting C2, which are currently in lead optimization. 
 RAPIVAB /RAPIACTA /PERAMIFLU (peramivir injection) . RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) is approved in the United States for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza for patients six months and older. Peramivir injection is also approved in Canada (RAPIVAB), Australia (RAPIVAB), Japan (RAPIACTA), Taiwan (RAPIACTA), and Korea (PERAMIFLU). 
 Revenues and Expenses 
 Our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on several factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. For example, our revenues depend, in part, on regulatory approval decisions for our products and product candidates, the effectiveness of our and our collaborative partners commercialization efforts, market acceptance of our products, particularly ORLADEYO, and the resources dedicated to our products and product candidates by us and our collaborative partners, as well as entering into or modifying licensing agreements for our product candidates. Furthermore, revenues related to our collaborative development activities are dependent upon the progress toward, and the achievement of, developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners. 
 Our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors, including research and development expenses, drug manufacturing, clinical research activities, the ongoing requirements of our development programs, the costs of commercialization, the availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies, which are difficult to predict, and the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Management may be able to control the timing and level of research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of our actions due to contractually committed activities and/or payments. 
 As a result of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful, and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Due to the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors. In such event, the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis, as situations change, and regularly discuss financial events, policies, and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm. In particular, we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition, administration, inventory and manufacturing, taxes, stock-based compensation, research and development, consulting and other expenses and any associated liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. See Critical Accounting Estimates at the end of this MD A for a description of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and that affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 Recent Developments 
 ORLADEYO (berotralstat) 
 On November 10, 2022, we announced new real-world data demonstrating rapid, sustained reduction of patient-reported HAE attacks and consistently low attack rates among patients 12 years and older who started on ORLADEYO for the prophylactic treatment of HAE, including patients who switched from other prophylactic therapies. 
 On November 28, 2022, we announced that the Israeli Ministry of Health granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in Israel. 
 On January 23, 2023, we announced that the Company entered into a collaboration with Swixx BioPharma AG Swixx to commercialize ORLADEYO in Central and Eastern Europe CEE ). Under the terms of the agreement, Swixx will be responsible for commercializing ORLADEYO in 15 markets within CEE. 
 On January 26, 2023, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the pivotal APeX-P trial evaluating ORLADEYO in pediatric HAE patients who are 2 to 97 percent suppression of the alternative pathway of the complement system 24 hours following a single 110 mg dose, and that BCX10013 has been safe and generally well-tolerated at all doses studied to date. On February 21, 2023, we announced that recent dose-related observations in an ongoing BCX10013 nonclinical study will delay the clinical program. 
 Additional Complement Targets. On November 1, 2022, we announced that, in addition to BCX10013, which targets the alternative pathway of complement, we are pursuing oral medicines directed at other targets across the classical, lectin and terminal pathways of the complement system, including C2, a critical upstream serine protease enzyme for 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 activation of the classical and lectin pathways. We have developed potent, selective molecules targeting C2, which are currently in lead optimization. 
 Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva FOP 
 On November 1, 2022, we announced that we believe that patients with FOP are likely to benefit from other oral ALK-2 inhibitors that currently are substantially ahead of our ALK-2 inhibitor, BCX9250, in development. Considering the expectation that patients will be well-served by these other products, and the approximately 100 million in additional investment that would be required to advance BCX9250 to approval, we are stopping the BCX9250 program and redirecting this investment to the other opportunities we have to serve patients with complement-mediated diseases. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The discussion below presents a summary of our results of operations for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. See Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022, for a summary of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to 2021 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, total revenues were 270.8 million as compared to 157.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase of 113.6 million was primarily due to an increase of 129.1 million of ORLADEYO net revenue, including royalties from sales in Japan through our partner Torii. Additionally, RAPIVAB revenues, primarily from the stockpiling sales to HHS, increased by 7.9 million, and other royalty revenue, primarily from Green Cross, increased by 1.7 million. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a reduction in milestone revenue of 15.0 million related to the NHI approval of ORLADEYO in Japan in 2021 and lower peramivir product revenue from inventory sales to our partners, which decreased by 4.4 million. Additionally, there was a reduction in contract revenue of 5.7 million in 2022 as a result of closing out our contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS for the development of galidesivir. 
 Cost of product sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 6.4 million and 7.2 million, respectively. The decrease in cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily associated with the decrease in sales of peramivir to our partners resulting in a decrease in cost of product sales of 3.0 million. This decrease was partially offset by increases in cost of product sales relative to the overall increase in ORLADEYO sales and the increase in RAPIVAB stockpiling sales to HHS for the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, an inventory valuation reserve of 0.9 million was recorded for inventory, primarily ORLADEYO, that was determined to be short-dated or at risk of expiration prior to usage. 
 Research and development R D expenses increased to 253.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 208.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased investment in the development of our Factor D program, including BCX9930 and BCX10013, as well as the BCX9250 / FOP program and other research, preclinical and development costs. In December 2022, we announced the discontinuation of the development of the BCX9930 program as well as the BCX9250 program. Accordingly, certain costs necessary to discontinue and close out these development programs were expensed in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022.

 The following table summarizes our R D expenses for the periods indicated (amounts are in thousands). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the total R D expenses. 
 2022 2021 2020 R D expenses by program: Factor D Program 146,912 132,267 35,265 Berotralstat 28,230 30,559 44,329 FOP 19,857 2,840 2,583 Galidesivir 1,077 5,740 9,705 Peramivir 788 1,245 1,613 Other research, preclinical and development costs 56,433 36,157 29,469 Total R D expenses 253,297 208,808 122,964 
 R D expenses include all direct and indirect expenses and are allocated to specific programs at the point of development of a lead product candidate. Direct expenses are charged directly to the program to which they relate, and indirect expenses are allocated based upon internal direct labor hours dedicated to each respective program. Direct expenses consist of compensation for R D personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies, develop manufacturing processes, manufacture the product candidates, and conduct and manage clinical trials, as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. Additionally, direct expenses consist of those costs necessary to discontinue and close out a development program, including termination fees and other commitments. Indirect R D expenses consist of lab supplies and services, facility expenses, depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts. R D expenses vary according to the number of programs in clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs. Later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the longer length of time of the clinical trials and the higher number of patients enrolled in these clinical trials. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 159.4 million compared to 118.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased investment to support the U.S. commercial launch of ORLADEYO and the expansion of international operations. SG A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included non-cash compensation charges on the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock options of 8.9 million. 
 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 99.1 million as compared to 59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily associated with the sale of certain royalty payments under the 2021 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement and the OMERS Royalty Purchase Agreement, which were entered into in November 2021, as well as the additional aggregate borrowing of 75.0 million of Term B and Term C Loans under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), which were funded on July 29, 2022. The nature of the royalty sales requires that we recognize a liability (the Royalty Financing Obligations for the future sale of royalties under these agreements. These liabilities are amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in the recognition of non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the Royalty Purchase Agreements (as defined in Note 8 Royalty Monetizations ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report). These increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of interest expense associated with the PhaRMA Notes, which were written-off at the end of 2021. 
 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of 76.5 million of non-cash interest expense due to the amortization of interest associated with the Royalty Financing Obligations and 22.5 million of interest expense, net of deferred financing amortization, associated with the borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of 37.7 million of non-cash interest expense due to the amortization of interest associated with the Royalty Financing Obligations and 15.5 million of interest expense, net of deferred financing amortization, associated with the Term A Loan under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we recognized 6.1 million in interest expense on the non-recourse PhaRMA Notes issued in March 2011. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest and other income was 3.1 million compared to interest and other income of 55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest income earned on investments of 5.1 million was partially offset by foreign currency losses of 2.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, a gain of 55.8 million on extinguishment of debt was recognized related to the write-off of the non- 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 recourse PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest payable. See Note 8 Royalty Monetizations RAPIACTA Non-Recourse Notes Payable Debt Extinguishment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information. This gain, as well as interest income of 0.1 million, was partially offset by foreign currency losses of 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a tax expense of 2.7 million as compared to tax expense of 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The tax expense for 2022 was primarily the result of amendments to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC ), which no longer permits an immediate deduction for research and development expenditures in the tax year that such costs are incurred. Instead, these IRC Section 174 research and development costs are capitalized and amortized over either a five or fifteen year period, depending on the location of the activities performed. The new amortization period begins with the midpoint of any taxable year that IRC Section 174 research and development costs are first incurred, regardless of whether the expenditures were made prior to or after July 1, and runs until the midpoint of year five for activities conducted in the United States or year fifteen for research and development activities conducted outside of the United States. Tax expense in 2021 was primarily the result of the recognition as upfront taxable income of 300.0 million received from the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement and the OMERS Royalty Purchase Agreement. For both 2022 and 2021, increased sales of ORLADEYO and increased nexus in multiple states and foreign jurisdictions, where historically we had none, contributed to increased tax expense. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities; cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements, including U.S. Government contracts for RAPIVAB and galidesivir; our credit facilities; and the Royalty Sales. In addition, we have previously received funding from other sources, including other collaborative and other research and development agreements, government grants, the PhaRMA Notes financing, equipment lease financing, facility leases, research grants, and interest income on our investments. 
 In 2020 and 2021, we entered into the Royalty Purchase Agreements with RPI and OMERS. Under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, RPI and OMERS are entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales of ORLADEYO in the United States and certain key European markets (collectively, the Key Territories ), and other markets where we sell ORLADEYO directly or through distributors. In addition, RPI and OMERS are entitled to receive a tiered revenue share on amounts generally received by us on account of ORLADEYO sublicense revenue or net sales by licensees outside of the Key Territories. We will be required to make payments to OMERS commencing with the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2023. See Note 8 Royalty Monetizations ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about these financing transactions. 
 In 2020, we entered into our Credit Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Co-Invest 1 LP Athyrium and such agreement, as subsequently amended, the Credit Agreement ). Our Credit Agreement with Athyrium provides for three term loans. We received the proceeds from the 125.0 million Term A Loan in December 2020. The Term B Loan and the Term C Loan were both funded in the respective principal amounts of 25.0 million and 50.0 million on July 29, 2022. The maturity date of the Credit Agreement is December 7, 2025. For each of the first eight full fiscal quarters following December 7, 2020, we had the option to make the applicable interest payment-in-kind (a PIK Interest Payment by capitalizing the entire amount of interest accrued during the applicable interest period with the unpaid original principal amount outstanding on the last day of such period. The quarter ended December 31, 2022 was the last PIK eligible period. Accordingly, we are obligated to make quarterly interest payments on the outstanding principal of the Term Loans as of December 31, 2022. See Note 9 Debt Credit Agreement in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Credit Agreement. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had net working capital of 411.0 million, a decrease of approximately 51.4 million from 462.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of general operations, partially offset by the 75.0 million proceeds received from the funding of the Term B Loan and Term C Loan in July 2022. Our principal sources of liquidity at December 31, 2022 were approximately 304.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 119.5 million in investments considered available-for-sale. 
 We intend to contain costs and cash flow requirements by closely managing our third-party costs and headcount, leasing scientific equipment and facilities, contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development projects, and using consultants. We expect to incur additional expenses, potentially resulting in significant losses, as we 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 continue to pursue our research and development activities, commercialize ORLADEYO, and hire additional personnel. We may incur additional expenses related to the filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense, and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical programs advance through later stages of development. The objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds, as well as to maintain liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. We place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and government agencies in order to limit the amount of our credit exposure. We have not realized any significant losses on our investments. 
 We plan to finance our needs principally from the following: 
 lease, royalty, or loan financing; 
 public or private equity and/or debt financing; 
 our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital; 
 revenues from product sales; and 
 payments under current or future collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners. 
 As our commercialization activities and research and development programs continue to advance, our costs will increase. Our current and planned clinical trials, plus the related development, manufacturing, regulatory approval process requirements, and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our products will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses. 
 Our expenses, revenues and cash utilization rate could vary significantly depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional capital, the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our product candidates, the amount of funding or assistance, if any, we receive from new partnerships with third parties for the development and/or commercialization of our products and product candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced product candidates, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead product candidates, the success of our commercialization efforts for, and market acceptance of, our products, and the overall progression of our other programs. The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on one or more of the foregoing factors could negatively affect our revenues, expenses, and cash utilization rate. 
 Based on our expectations for revenue and operating expenses, we believe our financial resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we have sustained operating losses for the majority of our corporate history and expect that our 2023 expenses will exceed our 2023 revenues. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows until revenues reach a level sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our liquidity needs will be largely determined by the success of operations in regard to the successful commercialization of our products and the future progression of our product candidates. We regularly evaluate other opportunities to fund future operations, including: (1) out-licensing rights to certain of our products or product candidates, pursuant to which we would receive cash milestone payments; (2) raising additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources, including royalty or other monetization transactions; (3) obtaining additional product candidate regulatory approvals, which would generate revenue, milestone payments and cash flow; (4) reducing spending on one or more research and development programs, including by discontinuing development; (5) restructuring operations to change our overhead structure and/or (6) securing or increasing U.S. Government funding of our programs, including obtaining procurement contracts. We may issue securities, including common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, purchase contracts, warrants, debt securities, and units, through private placement transactions or registered public offerings. Our future liquidity needs, and our ability to address those needs, will largely be determined by the success of our products and product candidates; the timing, scope, and magnitude of our research and development and commercial expenses; and key developments and regulatory events and our decisions in the future. 
 Our long-term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors, including: 
 market acceptance of approved products and successful commercialization of such products by either us or our partners; 
 our ability to receive reimbursement and stockpiling procurement contracts; 
 the progress and magnitude of our research, drug discovery and development programs; 
 changes in existing collaborative relationships; 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties; 
 the extent to which our partners will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves; 
 our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain products and product candidates; 
 any decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities; 
 the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and develop product candidates; 
 our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials; 
 the scope of manufacturing of our products to support our commercial operations and of our product candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials; 
 increases in personnel and related costs to support the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates; 
 the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and product candidates required for future NDA filings; 
 competitive and technological advances; 
 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; 
 post-approval commitments for ORLADEYO, RAPIVAB, and other products that receive regulatory approval; and 
 the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection, including the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims. 
 We may be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current products and product candidates, and we may seek to raise capital in the future, including to take advantage of favorable opportunities in the capital markets. Additional funding may not be available when needed or in the form or on terms acceptable to us. Our future working capital requirements, including the need for additional working capital, will largely be determined by the advancement of our portfolio of product candidates and the commercialization of ORLADEYO, as well as any future decisions regarding the future of the RAPIVAB program, including those relating to stockpiling procurement. More specifically, our working capital requirements will be dependent on the number, magnitude, scope and timing of our development programs; regulatory approval of our product candidates; obtaining funding from collaborative partners; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews, regulatory investigations, and changes in regulatory requirements; the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates; the timing and terms of business development activities; the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations; the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties; the timing, scope and magnitude of commercial spending; and the level of required administrative support for our daily operations. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Financial and Liquidity Risks and Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization If we fail to obtain additional financing or acceptable partnership arrangements as and when needed, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or continue operations in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the risks related to obtaining additional capital. 
 The restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Agreement could cause us to be unable to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial without the lender s permission or without repaying all obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things, grant certain types of liens on our assets; make certain investments; incur or assume certain debt; engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, and similar transactions; dispose of assets; license certain property; distribute dividends; make certain restricted payments; change the nature of our business; engage in transactions with affiliates and insiders; prepay other indebtedness; or engage in sale and leaseback transactions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP, which were utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, Topic 606 includes provisions within a five step model that includes (i) identifying the contract with a customer, (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
 At contract inception, we identify the goods or services promised within each contract, assess whether each promised good or service is distinct, and determine those that are performance obligations. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied. 
 Product Sales, Net 
 Our principal sources of product sales are sales of ORLADEYO, which we began shipping to patients in December 2020, sales of peramivir to our licensing partners and sales of RAPIVAB to the HHS under our procurement contract. In the United States, we ship ORLADEYO directly to patients through a single specialty pharmacy, which is considered our customer. In the European Union, United Kingdom and elsewhere, we sell ORLADEYO to specialty distributors as well as hospitals and pharmacies, which collectively are considered our customers. 
 We recognize revenue for sales when our customers obtain control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery. For ORLADEYO, we classify payments to our specialty pharmacy customer for certain services provided by our customer as selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent such services provided are determined to be distinct from the sale of our product. 
 Net revenue from sales of ORLADEYO is recorded at net selling price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for (i) estimated government rebates, such as Medicaid and Medicare Part D reimbursements, and estimated managed care rebates, (ii) estimated chargebacks, (iii) estimated costs of co-payment assistance programs and (iv) product returns. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable or as a current liability. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. 
 Government and Managed Care Rebates . We contract with government agencies and managed care organizations or, collectively, third-party payors, so that ORLADEYO will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. We estimate the rebates we will provide to third-party payors and deduct these estimated amounts from total gross product revenues at the time the revenues are recognized. These reserves are recorded in the same period in which the revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability. We estimate the rebates that we will provide to third-party payors based upon (i) our contracts with these third-party payors, (ii) the government mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs, (iii) a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix, and (iv) product distribution information obtained from our specialty pharmacy. 
 Chargebacks . Chargebacks are discounts that occur when certain contracted customers, pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies, and government programs purchase directly from our specialty pharmacy. These customers purchase our products under contracts negotiated between them and our specialty pharmacy. The specialty pharmacy, in turn, 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 charges back to us the difference between the price the specialty pharmacy paid and the negotiated price paid by the contracted customers, which may be higher or lower than the specialty pharmacy purchase price with us. We estimate chargebacks and adjust gross product revenues and accounts receivable based on the estimates at the time revenues are recognized. 
 Co-payment assistance and patient assistance programs . Patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance. Based upon the terms of the program and co-payment assistance utilization reports received from the specialty pharmacy, we are able to estimate the co-payment assistance amounts, which are recorded in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue. We also offer a patient assistance program that provides free drug product, for a limited period of time, to allow a patient s insurance coverage to be established. Based on patient assistance program utilization reports provided by the specialty pharmacy, we record gross revenue of the product provided and a full reduction of the revenue amount for the free drug discount. 
 Product returns . We do not provide contractual return rights to our customers, except in instances where the product is damaged or defective. Non-acceptance by the patient of shipped drug product by the specialty pharmacy is reflected as a reversal of sales in the period in which the sales were originally recorded. Reserves for estimated non-acceptances by patients are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the related revenue is recognized, as well as a reduction to accounts receivable. Estimates of non-acceptance are based on quantitative information provided by the specialty pharmacy. 
 Collaborative and Other Research and Development Arrangements and Royalties 
 We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring promised goods or services to a customer. Revenue is measured at the transaction price that is based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The transaction price includes estimates of variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. 
 We have collaboration and license agreements with a number of third parties as well as research and development agreements with certain government entities. 
 Our primary sources of revenue from these collaborative and other research and development arrangements are license, service and royalty revenues. 
 Revenue from license fees, royalty payments, milestone payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. 
 Arrangements that involve the delivery of more than one performance obligation are initially evaluated as to whether the intellectual property licenses granted by us represent distinct performance obligations. If they are determined to be distinct, the value of the intellectual property licenses would be recognized up-front while the research and development service fees would be recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. For performance obligations based on services performed, we measure progress using an input method based on the effort we expend or costs we incur toward the satisfaction of the performance obligation in relation to the total estimated effort or costs. Variable consideration is assessed at each reporting period as to whether it is not subject to significant future reversal and, therefore, should be included in the transaction price at the inception of the contract. If a contract includes a fixed or minimum amount of research and development support, this also would be included in the transaction price. Changes to collaborations, such as the extensions of the research term or increasing the number of targets or technology covered under an existing agreement, are assessed for whether they represent a modification or should be accounted for as a new contract. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling price using either an adjusted market assessment approach or an expected cost plus margin approach, representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the product or service. Analyzing the arrangement to identify performance obligations requires the use of judgment, and each may be an obligation to deliver services, a right or license to use an asset, or another performance obligation. 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 Milestone payments are recognized as licensing revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if (i) the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not probable at the inception of the agreement and (ii) we have a right to payment. Any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. 
 Reimbursements received for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss rather than as a reduction in expenses. Under our contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS, revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred. 
 Under certain of our license agreements, we receive royalty payments based upon our licensees net sales of covered products. Royalties are recognized at the later of when (i) the subsequent sale or usage occurs; or (ii) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been satisfied. 
 Inventory 
 Our inventories primarily relate to ORLADEYO. Additionally, our inventory includes RAPIVAB and peramivir. 
 We value our inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. We determine the cost of our inventories, which includes amounts related to materials, labor, manufacturing overhead and shipping and handling costs on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Raw materials and work-in-process includes all inventory costs prior to packaging and labeling, including raw material, active product ingredient, and drug product. Finished goods include packaged and labeled products. 
 Our inventories are subject to expiration dating. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and provide valuation reserves for any estimated obsolete, short-dated or unmarketable inventories. In addition, we may experience spoilage of our raw materials and supplies. Our determination that a valuation reserve might be required, in addition to the quantification of such reserve, requires us to utilize significant judgment. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we evaluated our inventory levels and associated expiration dating relative to the latest sales forecasts for ORLADEYO and RAPIVAB and estimated those inventories at risk of obsolescence. Accordingly, we recorded an increase to the inventory valuation reserve of 0.9 million for a total reserve of 1.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 We expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is expected to be recognized, which generally is upon receipt of regulatory approval. Upon regulatory approval, we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories. 
 Accrued Expenses 
 We enter into contractual agreements with third-party vendors who provide research and development, manufacturing, distribution, and other services in the ordinary course of business. Some of these contracts are subject to milestone-based invoicing, and services are completed over an extended period of time. We record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred. This accrual process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include (i) fees paid to clinical research organizations CROs in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials; (ii) fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; (iii) fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials, drug substance, drug products, and product candidates; and (iv) professional fees. 
 We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 performed and the level of effort expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of these costs, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. 
 Contract Balances 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets) and deferred revenue and billings in excess of revenue recognized (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Contract assets . Our long-term contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. Often this results in billing occurring subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Contract liabilities . We often receive cash payments from customers in advance of our performance, resulting in contract liabilities. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the revenue. 
 Contract costs. We may incur direct and indirect costs associated with obtaining a contract. Incremental contract costs that we expect to recover are capitalized and amortized over the expected term of the contract. Non-incremental contract costs and costs that we expect to recover are expensed as incurred. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. Research and development expenses include, among other items, personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed by CROs, materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs, as well as termination fees and other commitments associated with discontinued programs. Most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. Costs for studies performed by CROs are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of services actually performed. 
 Additionally, we have license agreements with third parties, such as Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University AECOM ), Industrial Research, Ltd. IRL ), and the University of Alabama UAB ), which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees. We expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred, in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period. We expense maintenance payments as incurred. 
 Deferred collaboration expenses represent sublicense payments paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners, and other consideration to our academic partners for modification to existing license agreements. These deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments or modifications from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized. We believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue. 
 We group our R D expenses into two major categories: direct external expenses and indirect expenses. Direct expenses consist of compensation for R D personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies, develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate, conduct and manage clinical trials, as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. Additionally, direct expenses consist of those costs necessary to discontinue and close out a development program, including termination fees and other commitments. These costs are accumulated and tracked by active program. Indirect expenses consist of lab supplies and services, facility expenses, depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts. These costs apply to work on non-active product candidates and our discovery research efforts. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 Stock-Based Compensation 
 All share-based payments, including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards, are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss based on their fair values. Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment, including estimating the life of an award, the stock price volatility, and the expected term. We utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value our stock option awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. The estimation of share-based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. In addition, we have outstanding performance-based stock options and restricted stock units for which no compensation expense is recognized until performance has occurred. Significant management judgment is also required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility and forfeitures to be used in the valuation of the options. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. 
 Interest Expense and Royalty Financing Obligations 
 The royalty financing obligations are eligible to be repaid based on royalties from net sales of ORLADEYO and BCX10013. Interest expense is accrued using the effective interest rate method over the estimated period each of the related liabilities will be paid. This requires us to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be generated from product sales over the life of the agreement. We impute interest on the carrying value of each of the royalty financing obligations and record interest expense using an imputed effective interest rate. We reassess the expected royalty payments each reporting period and account for any changes through an adjustment to the effective interest rate on a prospective basis. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the debt and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the carrying value of each of the liabilities, as well as the periods over which associated issuance costs will be amortized. A significant increase or decrease in forecasted net sales could materially impact each of the liability balances, interest expense and the time periods for repayment. 
 Foreign Currency Hedge 
 In connection with our issuance of the PhaRMA Notes, we entered into a foreign Currency Hedge Agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The final tranche of the options under the Currency Hedge Agreement expired in November 2020. The Currency Hedge Agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark-to-market adjustments were recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. 
 Tax 
 We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all potential tax assets, due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. The Term Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest each quarter at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 Offered Rate LIBOR ), which is capped to be no less than 1.75 and no more than 3.50 , plus 8.25 or, for each quarterly interest period in which a PIK Interest Payment is made, the three-month LIBOR plus 10.25 . Accordingly, increases in interest rates could increase the associated interest payments that we are required to make on the Term Loans. For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest was accrued at an effective interest rate of 12.87 on the 200.0 million borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
 The quarter ended December 31, 2022 was the last PIK eligible period. Accordingly, we are obligated to make quarterly interest payments on the outstanding principal of the Term Loans as of December 31, 2022. The three-month LIBOR was 4.73 as of December 28, 2022, the LIBOR measurement date for the three-month interest period beginning January 1, 2023. As the three-month LIBOR rate exceeds the LIBOR cap of 3.50 , the 3.50 cap plus 8.25 will be used to record interest expense for the three-month interest period beginning January 1, 2023. 
 In June 2023, LIBOR will be discontinued as a reference rate. The Credit Agreement contains language allowing for the substitution, through an amendment, of a new benchmark rate, which may be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), in the event that LIBOR is no longer available. This transition is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. Our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue, issuer or type of investment. We place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Some of the securities we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. 
 Our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio, changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors, as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses. Our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments, including our borrowings, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We generally have the ability to hold our fixed-income investments to maturity and, therefore, do not expect that our operating results, financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates. However, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors, such as changes in credit risk related to the securities issuers. To minimize this risk, we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. Generally, our investments are not collateralized. We have not realized any significant losses from our investments. 
 We do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Most of our revenues and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our commercial sales in Europe are primarily denominated in Euros and the British Pound. We also had other transactions denominated in foreign currencies during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to operations in Europe, contract manufacturing and ex-U.S. clinical trial activities, and we expect to continue to do so. Our royalties from Torii are derived from Torii s sales of ORLADEYO in Japan. Those sales are denominated in Japanese yen and converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining the royalty owed to us. Our limited foreign currency exposure relative to our European operations is to fluctuations in the Euro, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Danish Krone, and Swedish Krona. Additionally, we have initiated operations in Canada and have foreign currency exposure relative to the Canadian Dollar. 
 We do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations. However, transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 operations internationally. We have not engaged in foreign currency hedging during 2022; however, we may do so in the future. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation generally impacts us by potentially increasing our operating expenses, including clinical trial costs and selling activities. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or results of operations during the periods for which the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in this report. Significant adverse changes in inflation could negatively impact our future results of operations.

 and requires an average portfolio maturity of no more than months. Some of the securities in which the Company invests may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, the Company schedules its investments with maturities that coincide with expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, the Company does not believe it has a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from its investments. Generally, the Company s investments are not collateralized. The Company has not realized any significant losses from its investments.

 financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Company s agreement with Shionogi (the Shionogi Agreement ), pursuant to which Shionogi licensed from the Company the rights to market RAPIACTA in Japan and Taiwan. The Company received net proceeds of from the transaction after transaction costs of and the establishment of a interest reserve account by JPR Royalty Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Royalty Sub ), available to help cover interest shortfalls in the future. All of the interest reserve account has been fully utilized with the September 2012 interest payment. 
 As part of the transaction, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated as of March 9, 2011 with Royalty Sub, whereby the Company transferred to Royalty Sub, among other things, (i) its rights to receive certain royalty and milestone payments from Shionogi arising under the Shionogi Agreement and (ii) the right to receive payments under a Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement (as further described below, the Currency Hedge Agreement put into place by the Company in connection with the transaction. Royalty payments are paid by Shionogi in Japanese yen, and any milestone payments will be paid in U.S. dollars. The Company s collaboration with Shionogi was not impacted as a result of this transaction. 
 Non-Recourse Notes Payable 
 On March 9, 2011, Royalty Sub completed a private placement to institutional investors of in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured Notes due on December 1, 2020 (the PhaRMA Notes ). The PhaRMA Notes were issued by Royalty Sub under an Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the Indenture ), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are payable from, and are secured by, the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement transferred by the Company to Royalty Sub and payments, if any, made to Royalty Sub under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The PhaRMA Notes bear interest at per annum, payable annually in arrears on September 1st of each year. The Company remains entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes. 
 Royalty Sub s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of the Company s pledge of its equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. The Company may, but is not obligated to, make capital contributions to a capital account that may be used to redeem, or on up to one occasion pay any interest shortfall on, the PhaRMA Notes. 
 In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the accrued interest obligation due September 3, 2013. Under the terms of the Indenture, Royalty Sub s inability to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding payment date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014, constituted an event of default. Accordingly, the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest have been classified as current liabilities on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet and thereafter. As a result of the event of default under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and the equity interest in Royalty Sub and exercise other remedies available to them under the Indenture in respect of the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, the Company may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to it following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and it might otherwise be adversely affected. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential foreclosure, the primary impact to the Company would be the loss of future royalty payments, if any, from Shionogi and legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. The PhaRMA Notes had a final legal maturity date of December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of , together with accrued and unpaid interest of , was due in full. 
 Non-Recourse Notes Payable Debt Extinguishment 
 During 2021, the royalty-bearing patents associated with RAPIACTA in Japan expired. Accordingly, the Company evaluated the current circumstances of the PhaRMA Notes, including (i) their non-recourse nature relative to the Company,

 The transactions contemplated by each of the Royalty Purchase Agreements are referred to herein as the Royalty Sales. 
 Under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, the Company has agreed to specified affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants regarding periodic reporting of information by the Company to RPI and OMERS, third-party audits of royalties paid under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, and restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness other than certain royalty sales and as is permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Company s Credit Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Co-Invest 1 LP.

The restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness are eliminated after the achievement of certain specified milestones in the Royalty Purchase Agreements. 
 The cash consideration obtained pursuant to the Royalty Purchase Agreements is recorded in Royalty financing obligations on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value for the royalty financing obligations at the time of the transactions was based on the Company s estimates of future royalties expected to be paid to the counterparty over the life of the arrangement. The Company subsequently records the obligations at its carrying value using the effective interest method. In order to amortize the royalty financing obligations, the Company utilizes the prospective method to estimate the future royalties to be paid by the Company to the counterparty over the life of the arrangement. Under the prospective method, a new effective interest rate is determined based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The new rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the revised estimate of remaining cash flows with the carrying amount of the debt, and it will be used to recognize interest expense for the remaining periods. The Company periodically assesses the amount and timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. The estimates of future net product sales (and resulting royalty payments) are based on key assumptions including population, penetration, probability of success, and sales price, among others. To the extent such payments are greater or less than the Company s initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the amortization of the royalty financing obligations and the effective interest rate. 
 In 2022, the Company adjusted its forecasts related to its R D programs and ORLADEYO sales. Accordingly, this impacted the amount and timing of expected royalties to be made under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements. As a result, the effective interest rate related to the 2020 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement decreased from to , and the effective interest rate related to the 2021 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement decreased from to . Additionally, the effective interest rate related to the OMERS Agreement increased from to .

The expected life is based on the average of the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full vesting and the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the midpoint of the current date (if already vested) or at full vesting (if not yet vested) and the full contractual term. The expected volatility represents the historical volatility on the Company s publicly-traded common stock. The Company has assumed expected dividend yield, as dividends have never been paid to stock or option holders and will not be paid for the foreseeable future. The weighted average risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

 Accrued Clinical Trial and Manufacturing Activities Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded 87.6 million of accrued expenses which includes costs for clinical trial and manufacturing activities (together, clinical related activities) based upon estimates of expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations (CROs), clinical study sites, contract manufacturing organizations, or other vendors (together, clinical vendors). This accrual process involves estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. 
 Auditing the Company s accruals for costs associated with in-process clinical related activities may include judgment because the timing and pattern of vendor invoicing may not correspond to the level of services provided and the estimate can incorporate significant assumptions such as expected patient enrollment, site activation, and estimated project duration. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that addressed the information used in and the identified risks related to the Company s process for recording accrued costs for clinical related activities. 
 To evaluate the accrual for clinical related expenses, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the Company s contracts with clinical vendors (including pending change orders), testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate of the level of service provided including evaluating the significant assumptions as discussed above for the applicable in process contracts with clinical vendors. To assess the significant assumptions, we corroborated the progress of clinical related activities through inquiry with the Company s clinical team and with information obtained directly from third party clinical vendors, as well as tested invoices received from clinical vendors subsequent to the balance sheet date.

 Royalty Financing Obligations Description of the Matter As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company entered into Royalty Purchase Agreements RPA s with third parties. Pursuant to the RPA s, the Company received proceeds of approximately 425 million in exchange for the right to receive royalty payments based on future net revenues of the Company s commercialized drug, Orladeyo, and other drug candidates as specified in the agreements. 
 The Company recorded the RPA s as non-current liability instruments (royalty financing obligations) on the balance sheet at their carrying value of 501.7 million as of December 31, 2022, and imputed interest expense associated with these liabilities using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the liability to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of each arrangement. The interest rates on these instruments may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level and timing of forecasted net revenues which affects the repayment timing and ultimate amount of repayment. In order to amortize the royalty financing obligations, the Company utilizes the prospective method to estimate the future royalties to be paid by the Company to the third parties over the life of the arrangements. Under the prospective method, a new effective interest rate is determined based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The Company periodically assesses the amount and timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. 
 Auditing the royalty financing obligations was complex and highly judgmental due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the effective interest rates. The Company s effective interest rate models includes actual revenues recorded and royalties paid to-date, as well as revenue projections for which future royalties will be paid, which are sensitive to significant assumptions (including population, market penetration, probability of success, and sales price, among others) that are affected by expectations about future market conditions. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s processes to account for the royalty financing obligations, including controls over management s review of the revenue projections within the models. 
 To evaluate the royalty financing obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the underlying data and assumptions used by the Company in its effective interest rate models. We compared the significant assumptions in the revenue projections to current industry, market and economic trends. We recalculated the current year interest expense based on the amortization schedules and estimates of royalties using the effective interest method and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in the effective interest rates, and associated interest expense, that would result from changes in the assumptions.

 Product Sales, net Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 1, when recognizing revenue, the Company makes an estimate of the net selling price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded net product sales of 267.7 million. Product sales are recorded net of adjustments for variable consideration including estimated government rebates, managed care rebates, chargebacks, costs of co-payment for assistance programs, and product returns at the time revenue is recorded. Limited historical data is available for use in developing such estimates which are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary. 
 The Company s estimates of variable consideration depend on the identification of key customer contract terms and conditions, as well as estimates of sales volumes to different classes of payors. The revenue recognition process can be complex and can involve judgment related to these estimates as well as to identify and assess the terms and conditions of customer agreements and related government regulations that could affect revenue recognition, as the Company s revenue expands with new customers and new markets. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process of recording product sales and related rebates, chargebacks and returns. We also tested management s controls related to the identification and assessment of the terms and conditions of customer agreements and the completeness and accuracy of data utilized in the controls, and the calculations supporting management s estimates. 
 To test product sales, our audit procedures included, among others, tracing a sample of revenue transactions recognized during the year to source documentation. We also confirmed a sample of outstanding receivable balances directly with the Company s customers. To test management s estimates of variable consideration, we obtained management s calculations for the respective estimates and performed one or more of the following procedures: tested management s estimation process to assess whether the recorded reserve balances are within a reasonable range of estimate, performed retrospective reviews, assessed subsequent events, and tested a sample of credits issued throughout the year. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1993.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO Framework). Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. 
 Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management believes our internal control over financial reporting will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on page 106 of this report.

 (a) The RSUs are hereby granted and issued to the Recipient, effective as of the Grant Date set forth in the accompanying Award Notice, in consideration of the employment services to be rendered by the Recipient to the Company in accordance with Article Three of the Plan. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions hereof. This Award is made subject to and awarded upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. 
 
 (b) As promptly as practicable following the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 (and in all events no later than March 15 of the year following the year of vesting (unless earlier delivery is required by Section 409A of the Code or delivery is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code)), the Company shall issue, in the name of the Recipient, the number of shares of Common Stock that have vested. 
 
 (c) The Recipient agrees that the RSUs shall be subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement and the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement. 
 
 2. General Vesting Terms Lapsing of Restrictions .

Subject to Recipient s continuous employment with or service to the Company from the Grant Date through each applicable Vesting Date, the RSUs shall vest and no longer be subject to forfeiture according to the vesting schedule set forth in the Award Notice (each such date on which RSUs shall vest, a Vesting Date ). 
 
 (b) Change in Control . If a Change in Control occurs, Article III, Section 2 of the Plan shall govern the treatment of the RSUs in connection therewith. 
 
 (c) Continuous Employment and Service .

 2 

advisor. The Recipient shall be deemed to be an employee for so long as Recipient remains in the employ of the Company or one or more of its parent or subsidiary corporations subject to the control and direction of the employer entity as to both the work to be performed and the manner and method of performance. For purposes of this Agreement, a corporation shall be considered to be a subsidiary corporation of the Company if it is a member of an unbroken chain of corporations beginning with the Company, provided each such corporation in the chain (other than the last corporation) owns, at the time of determination, stock possessing 50 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one of the other corporations in such chain. Similarly, for purposes of this Agreement, a corporation shall be considered to be a parent corporation of the Company if it is a member of an unbroken chain ending with the Company, provided each such corporation in the chain (other than the Company) owns, at the time of determination, stock possessing 50 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one of the other corporations in such chain.

The Recipient shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are so forfeited. If the Recipient is employed by a subsidiary of the Company, any references in this Agreement to employment with the Company shall instead be deemed to refer to employment with such subsidiary. 
 
 4. Restrictions on Transfer . 
 
 The Recipient shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively transfer any RSUs, or any interest therein (but may transfer Common Stock after its issuance pursuant to Section 1(b) above).

The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs (or issue shares of Common Stock with respect thereto) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 5. Rights as a Shareholder . 
 
 The Recipient shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the RSUs until such times as shares of Common Stock are issued in settlement thereof provided , however , that if any dividends and distributions with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs are paid in cash or shares, or consist of a dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, the shares, cash or other property will be credited to a notional account on behalf of the Recipient subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the related RSUs. 
 
 6. Tax Matters . 
 
 (a) Acknowledgments . The Recipient acknowledges that Recipient is responsible for obtaining the advice of the Recipient s own tax advisors with respect to the acquisition and vesting of the RSUs and that Recipient is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents with respect to the tax consequences relating to the RSUs. The Recipient understands that the Recipient (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any and all of Recipient s tax liabilities that may arise in connection with the acquisition, vesting and or settlement of the RSUs. 
 3 

(b) Withholding . Unless the Plan Administrator expressly authorizes otherwise, the Recipient shall satisfy all tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of RSUs by either (i) automatically having withheld or otherwise transferring to the Company, effective as of each Vesting Date, such number of shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest on such Vesting Date as have a fair market value (calculated in accordance with the Plan) equal to the amount of the applicable tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of such RSUs, or (ii) through a sale-to-cover transaction authorized by the Recipient, pursuant to which an immediate open-market sale of a portion of the shares of Common Stock issued to Recipient will be effected, for and on behalf of the Recipient, by the Company s designated broker to cover such withholding obligations (however, no sale-to-cover transaction shall be effected unless such a sale is at the time permissible under the Company s insider trading policies governing the sale of Common Stock). The Recipient further acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Recipient any other federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the vesting and settlement of the RSUs in the event the withholding of shares of Common Stock authorized above is insufficient to satisfy all tax withholding obligations. If requested by the Plan Administrator, the Recipient agrees to satisfy such tax withholding obligations by making a cash payment to the Company on the date of vesting of the RSUs, in such amount as the Company determines is necessary to satisfy its withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of such RSUs. 
 
 7. Miscellaneous . 
 
 (a) Authority of the Plan Administrator . In making any decisions or taking any actions with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement, the Plan Administrator shall have full authority and discretion, and shall be subject to all of the protections provided for in the Plan. All decisions and actions by the Plan Administrator with respect to this Agreement shall be made in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all. 
 
 (b) No Employment or Service Contract . The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that vesting and settlement of the RSUs is contingent upon Recipient s continued employment with, or service to, the Company (or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company employing or retaining Recipient), this Agreement does not constitute an express or implied promise of continued employment or service and nothing herein or in the Plan shall confer upon the Recipient any rights to continue in the employment or service of the Company (or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company employing or retaining Recipient) for any period of time or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company employing or retaining Recipient) or Recipient, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Recipient s service or employment at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. 
 
 (c) Notices . Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company in care of the Corporate Secretary at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Recipient shall be in writing and addressed to the Recipient at the address indicated below Recipient s signature line of the Award Notice or such address as Recipient may provide for the Company to keep on file as updated from time to time. All notices shall be deemed to have been given or delivered upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the U. S. Mail, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the party to be notified. 
 
 (d) Construction Amendment . The Recipient acknowledges that Recipient has read this Agreement, has received and read the Plan, and understands the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan. This Agreement and the RSUs evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all respects limited by and subject to the express terms and provisions of the Plan. All decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having or claiming an interest in the RSUs. This Agreement may only be amended by a writing executed by the parties hereto expressly providing for amendment of this Agreement except that the Plan Administrator may unilaterally make amendments that do not adversely affect Recipient s rights hereunder, provided timely notice of such amendments is provided to Recipient. 
 4 

(e) Successors and Assigns . Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns of Recipient and the successors and assigns of the Company. 
 
 (f) Liability of the Company . If the RSUs exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of shares of Common Stock which may without shareholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this Award shall be void with respect to such excess shares unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and all applicable laws. The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals. 
 
 (g) Compliance with Laws and Regulations . The award of RSUs hereunder and the settlement thereof is subject to compliance by the Company and Recipient with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and all applicable regulations of any stock exchange or over-the-counter market on which such shares may be listed or traded at the time of such exercise and issuance. In connection with the settlement of RSUs, Recipient shall execute and deliver to the Company such representations in writing as may be requested by the Company in order for it to comply with the applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws. 
 
 (h) Capitalized Terms Conflict . Capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the meaning specified in the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan controls. 
 
 (i) Electronic Delivery . Recipient hereby consents to the delivery of information (including, without limitation, information required to be delivered to Recipient pursuant to applicable securities laws) regarding the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, the Plan, and the RSUs via Company web site or other electronic delivery. 
 
 (j) Headings . The headings preceding the text of the sections hereof are inserted solely for convenience of reference, and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement, nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect. 
 
 (k) Governing Law . The interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to that state s conflict-of-laws rules.
