USE OF NAMES AND CURRENCY 
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we , us , our , Company , or Planet 13 refer to Planet 13 Holdings Inc. together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated, all references to , US or USD in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to United States dollars, and all references to C or CAD refer to Canadian dollars. 
 
 IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 
 
 As a company with less than 1.235 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act , as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act . As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other exemptions from requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include: 

Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

Exemptions from non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute; and 

Exemption from auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of the common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.

 Item 1. Business. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a vertically integrated cultivator and provider of cannabis and cannabis-infused products in the States of Nevada and California. In addition to these operational cannabis licenses, we hold licenses and are developing operations in Florida and Illinois. Our common shares are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange CSE under the symbol PLTH and quoted on the OTCQX in the United States under the symbol PLNHF. 
 
 Through our subsidiaries in Nevada, we hold six licenses for cultivation (three medical licenses and three adult-use licenses), six licenses for production (three medical licenses and three adult-use licenses), three dispensary licenses (one medical license and two adult-use licenses) and one distribution license. 
 
 Additionally, in California, through Newtonian Principles, Inc. Newtonian ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours located in Santa Ana, California, we hold one dispensary license and one distribution license. 
 
 On March 2, 2022, we acquired through a plan of arrangement, and then amalgamated with, Next Green Wave Holdings Inc. NGW ). NGW was a Canada-based seed to sale cannabis company, which provided products and services to the cannabis industry in the State of California. See 2022 Acquisition of Next Green Wave Holdings Inc. With the California subsidiaries obtained from our acquisition of NGW, we received two licenses for adult-use cultivation, one cultivation adult-use nursery license, one cultivation medical license, one adult-use and medical distribution license, one adult-use and medical manufacturer Type P license, and a pending application for a cultivation processor license. Shortly after acquiring NGW, we initiated a series of updates and consolidations of NGW licenses, resulting in upgrading the Type P license to a Type 6 manufacturing license, and consolidating the various cultivation licenses into a medium cultivation license. Pursuant to the consolidation, on February 27, 2023, we further requested to relinquish our nursery and processor licenses, as those are redundant under the medium cultivation license. 
 
 On July 1, 2022, we acquired a 23-acre parcel of real property, inclusive of a 10,500 square foot building, near Ocala, Florida which is currently authorized to cultivate, process, and dispense medical marijuana. We are in the process of developing our operational plans and continue to select dispensing locations across Florida which we expect to supply from the Ocala cultivation and processing location. 
 
 On July 22, 2022, we received the previously awarded Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region and intend to open a dispensary in Waukegan, a suburb of Chicago, by mid to late 2023. 
 
 We currently sell over 123 different strains of cannabis (up to 35 of which are grown in-house) and have a customer-loyalty database of over 385,000 customers. We own and manufacture cannabis products under the following brands: HaHa (gummies and beverages), Dreamland (chocolates), TRENDI (vapes and concentrates), Medizin (flower, vapes, concentrates), Leaf and Vine (vapes).

 History of the Company 
 
 We were incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act CBCA on April 26, 2002 under the name High Income Preferred Shares Corporation. On October 18, 2010, Wombat Investment Trust acquired control of us and on January 1, 2011, we changed our name to Carpincho Capital Corp. Carpincho ). 
 
 MM Development Company, Inc. MMDC ), now one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, was formed on March 20, 2014 as a Nevada limited liability company under the name MM Development Company, LLC MMDC LLC with the mission to provide compassionate, dignified and affordable access to cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products to approved customers in the State of Nevada. MMDC LLC underwent a statutory conversion to a Nevada corporation and became MMDC on March 14, 2018. On June 11, 2018, MMDC completed a reverse-takeover RTO or Business Combination transaction of Carpincho and filed Articles of Amendment to effect (i) a consolidation of its share capital on a 0.875 (new) for one (1) old basis (ii) a name change from Carpincho Capital Corp. to Planet 13 Holdings Inc. and (iii) the creation of a new class of convertible, class A restricted voting shares (the Restricted Voting Shares ). The Restricted Voting Shares were convertible into common shares of the Company (the Common Shares at the option of the holders on a share-for-share basis. 
 
 On May 31, 2018, the Nevada State Department of Taxation DOT ), the agency which regulated cannabis operations in Nevada, approved the transfer of MMDC s cultivation production and dispensary licenses to us. 
 
 On June 26, 2019, we continued out of the jurisdiction of Canada under the CBCA into the jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) BCBCA ). On August 12, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary 10653918 Canada Inc. Finco was continued out of the jurisdiction of Canada under the CBCA into the jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia under the BCBCA and on September 24, 2019, we completed a short-form vertical amalgamation with Finco (the Short Form Amalgamation ). The Short Form Amalgamation was undertaken to simplify our corporate structure and to obtain certain administrative and financial reporting efficiencies. No securities were issued in connection with the Short Form Amalgamation. 
 
 Prior to the completion of the Business Combination, the only active business operations of Carpincho was to carry on activities as a venture capital company seeking assets or businesses with good growth potential to merge with or acquire. Following the Business Combination, we have continued the business of MMDC. 
 
 2018 Financings, Subscription Receipt Offering, Bought Deal Offering 
 
 2018 Financings 
 
 Prior to 2018, MMDC was largely financed by its founders Robert Groesbeck and Larry Scheffler, and companies controlled by them, through a combination of cash contributions classified as debt with accrued interest exceeding US 6,600,000 and reinvestment of operating proceeds. 
 
 On January 1, 2018, Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler converted an aggregate of US 3,334,304 of their controlled entity debts to equity in MMDC and Chris Wren, Vice President of Operations of MMDC, contributed valuable intellectual property, including genetic strains, cultivation processes, and manufacturing processes, to MMDC in return for a 6 interest in MMDC. The foregoing resulted in MMDC issuing to such persons, in the aggregate, 25,300 class A common voting shares of MMDC and 49,700,000 class B common non-voting shares of MMDC which were subsequently converted into 25,300,000 Common Shares and 49,700,000 Restricted Voting Shares, respectively, on closing of the Business Combination. 
 
 On June 20, 2018, Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler, through controlled companies, converted an aggregate of approximately US 3,400,000 principal amount and accrued interest of unsecured promissory notes of the Company held by them into an aggregate of 5,532,940 Restricted Voting Shares, or 2,766,470 Restricted Voting Shares each, at a conversion price of C 0.80 per Restricted Voting Share. 
 
 On October 15, 2015, an original member of MMDC LLC, Ollehea, LLC, requested that MMDC LLC repurchase its interest as allowed under an operating agreement then in effect. Consequently, the remaining members of MMDC LLC at the time agreed to issue promissory notes to Ollehea on behalf of the MMDC LLC in the amount of US 101,997 each to satisfy the repurchase requirement. The notes were repaid by us on July 9, 2018.

April-May 2018 Subscription Receipt Offering 
 
 Over the course of three tranches on April 26, May 18 and May 23, 2018, Finco completed private placements of subscription receipts (the Subscription Receipts at a price of C 0.80 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C 25,100,000 (the Subscription Receipt Offering ), the brokered portion of which was conducted by a syndicate of agents co-led by Beacon Securities Limited and Canaccord Genuity Corp. and including Haywood Securities Inc. (collectively, the Agents ). The proceeds from the Subscription Receipt Offering, less certain expenses, were placed into escrow on completion of the Subscription Receipt Offering. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, the Subscription Receipts were converted on a one-for-one basis into a total of 31,458,300 common shares of Finco and 15,729,150 common share purchase warrants of Finco, which upon completion of the acquisition of Finco by us were exchanged for an equal number of Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants (the Common Share Warrants ), respectively, and the escrowed proceeds from the Subscription Receipt Offering, less the commission of the Agents and certain fees and expenses, were released from escrow to us. Each Common Share Warrant may be exercised for one Common Share at an exercise price of C 1.40 for a period of 24 months from the date of issue. In consideration for services rendered, the Agents were paid a cash commission equal to 6 of the gross proceeds of the Subscription Receipt Offering and issued 1,485,645 compensation warrants (the Compensation Warrants ). Each Compensation Warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of C 0.80 until June 11, 2020. 
 
 December 2018 Bought Deal Offering 
 
 On December 4, 2018, we issued 8,735,250 units (each, a Unit at a price of C 3.00 per Unit and 425,000 Common Share Warrants (the Over-Allotment Warrants for a price of C 0.44 per Over-Allotment Warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of C 26,392,750 pursuant to a bought deal offering (the 2018 Bought Deal Offering ). The 2018 Bought Deal Offering was led by Beacon Securities Limited and included Canaccord Genuity Corp and Cormark Securities Inc. (collectively, the 2018 Bought Deal Underwriters ). Each Unit was comprised of one Common Share and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a Unit Warrant and, together with the Over-Allotment Warrants, the 2018 Bought Deal Warrants ). Each 2018 Bought Deal Warrant entitled the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of C 3.75 for a period of 36 months following the closing of the 2018 Bought Deal Offering unless earlier accelerated by us pursuant to the terms thereof. On December 23, 2020, we announced that we had elected to accelerate the expiry date of the outstanding 2018 Bought Deal Warrants to January 28, 2021. 
 
 As consideration for services rendered, the 2018 Bought Deal Underwriters were paid a cash commission equal to 6.0 of the gross proceeds of the 2018 Bought Deal Offering and issued compensation options equal to 6 of the number of Units and Over-Allotment Warrants sold (the Compensation Options ).

 July 2020 WCDN Acquisition 
 
 On July 17, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the WCDN Asset Acquisition Agreement with West Coast Development Nevada, LLC WCDN ), W The Brand, LLC, and R. Scott Coffman, pursuant to which we, through MMDC, acquired cannabis inventory, equipment and tenant improvements located in a 25,000 square feet facility at 4801 West Bell Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118 (the WCDN Acquisition Facility ), which has the ability to expand to 45,000 square feet (the WCDN Acquisition ). The purchase price for the asset purchase was US 4.1 million and consisted of US 1,156,000 in cash for the inventory and US 3,000,000 million (US 500,000 cash and US 2,500,000 of Common Shares, resulting in the issuance of 1,374,833 Common Shares (the WCDN Consideration Shares based on a 10-day volume weighted average price of the Common Shares as of the close of trading on July 16, 2020) for the operating assets and licenses. The WCDN Consideration Shares were held in escrow until the Second Closing (as defined herein). The WCDN Acquisition allowed us to solidify our vertical integration in Nevada. The privileged licenses included medical and adult-use cultivation and production licenses in unincorporated Clark County, and these licenses were transferred to our existing Nevada subsidiary, MMDC, to be operated on the same terms and subject to the same oversight provided at MMDC s current production and cultivation operations in unincorporated Clark County, Nevada. 
 
 The transaction was scheduled to close in two parts, the first closing being cash transferred for the equipment and cannabis inventory which occurred on July 17, 2020, and the second closing (the Second Closing being contingent on the approval to transfer the license and receipt of the cultivation and production licenses from the State of Nevada s Cannabis Compliance Board (the CCB ). On August 25, 2020, the CCB conditionally approved the transfer of the cultivation and production licenses to MMDC, and on September 3, 2020, MMDC received the cultivation and production licenses pursuant to a letter from the CCB and certificates issued on November 3, 2020. Pursuant to the WCDN Acquisition, MMDC also received a conditional distribution license which it did not place into operation and later sold on January 6, 2023. 
 
 On September 11, 2020, we mutually agreed with WCDN that the receipt by MMDC of a business license issued by unincorporated Clark County which would permit us to conduct business in Clark County (the Clark County Business License was a necessary condition precedent to the Second Closing. MMDC received the Clark County Business License and subsequently completed the Second Closing on November 27, 2020, at which time WCDN Consideration Shares were released from escrow to WCDN. 
 
 Concurrent with the first closing of the WCDN Acquisition, RX Land, LLC RX Land ), an entity owned by Robert Groesbeck and Larry Scheffler (our co-chief executive officers, collectively the Co-CEOs and each a Co-CEO ), acquired the WCDN Acquisition Facility for US 3.3 million and entered into a lease agreement with WCDN in respect of such facility (the Initial West Bell Lease ). In accordance with the terms of the WCDN Asset Acquisition Agreement and approvals by our independent directors, WCDN assigned the Initial West Bell Lease to MMDC on November 25, 2020, and MMDC subsequently entered into an amending agreement with RX Land on November 27, 2020, to amend certain terms of such lease agreement including increasing the lease payments, extending the duration of the lease and, if desired, allowing for second floor installation by MMDC without a corresponding lease rate increase due to an increase in facility size.

 Recent Developments 
 
 March 2022 NGW Acquisition 
 
 On March 2, 2022 (the Closing Date ), we completed our acquisition of NGW. We entered into an arrangement agreement (the Arrangement Agreement with NGW on December 20, 2021 pursuant to which we agreed to acquire (the Arrangement all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NGW (the NGW Shares ), and then amalgamate with NGW pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Arrangement was approved by the holders of NGW Shares (the NGW Shareholders at a special meeting of NGW Shareholders held on February 25, 2022 and approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 1, 2022. 
 
 Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, at 12:01 a.m. (Vancouver time) (the Effective Time on the Closing Date, we acquired all of the NGW Shares for a total consideration of approximately C 71,345,747 (based on the closing price of our Common Shares (the Planet 13 Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange on March 2, 2022), and NGW then amalgamated with us. The NGW Shareholders received 0.1145 of one Planet 13 Share (the Exchange Ratio and a nominal cash payment of C 0.0001 for each NGW Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time. As a result, 21,361,002 Planet 13 Shares and C 18,656 in cash were issued in exchange for the NGW Shares. In addition, the number of Planet 13 Shares issued to any person pursuant to the Arrangement was rounded down to the nearest whole Planet 13 Share, with a cash consideration paid in lieu of the issuance of such fractional Planet 13 Share of C 3.379 per share, resulting in an aggregate cash-in-lieu consideration of C 77.61. 
 
 Based upon the Exchange Ratio, all NGW options to acquire NGW Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were also exchanged for our options that will entitle the holders to receive, upon exercise thereof, Planet 13 Shares. As a result, we issued 1,106,925 options in exchange for the NGW options. 
 
 Though we have since restructured the cannabis licenses of NGW (as more fully set forth in Table 1 in the Licenses section below), through this acquisition, we gained seven cannabis licenses in the State of California. The combined licenses of Newtonian and NGW allow for cultivation, production, distribution, and dispensing activities in California.

 Overview of the Company s Cannabis Business 
 
 Introduction 
 
 On November 1, 2018, we opened the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, less than 500 feet from the Trump Tower and less than 2,500 feet from the Wynn hotel. MMDC entered into an arm s length agreement to lease a 100,000 square foot building to house its Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore dispensary and corporate office space in a Phase I build-out of the location (the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore ). In October 2019, we opened a 4,500-square-foot coffee shop and pizzeria in the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore. In 2020, the coffee shop and pizzeria were renamed as the Trece Eatery + Spirits restaurant, owned and operated by us through our subsidiaries. Future plans include the opening of a possible consumption lounge and a non-cannabis retail facility. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore lease has a seven-year term with two seven-year renewal options and we have a right-of-first-refusal on any sale of the building. Prior to opening the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, we sold both medical and adult-use products from our then existing facilities. On April 1, 2019, we entered into a lease and sub-license agreement for an additional 4.17 acres of land directly adjacent to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore for additional parking. The term of the April 1, 2019 lease and sub-license runs concurrent with the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore lease. 
 
 We may in the future build a 100,000 square foot greenhouse for cultivation and an approximately 43,000 square foot processing/production facility located in Beatty, Nevada, approximately 120 miles north-west of Las Vegas. The Beatty location is licensed and zoned for up to three million square feet of greenhouse space for the cultivation of cannabis. The site, which is owned by us, has been permitted and is ready for construction to begin. We are evaluating the timing of construction based on a current excess of supply of wholesale cannabis product in the State of Nevada and in the event of future federal legalization. We expect to revisit our expansion plans for the Beatty facility once the wholesale market in Nevada stabilizes. 
 
 Cultivation 
 
 We operate our Nevada cultivation licenses at three separate facilities, each location operating jointly under a medical and adult-use cultivation license. Two of our cultivation licenses operate out of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada (Las Vegas) and include indoor cultivation and perpetual harvest cycles. One is located in an approximately 16,100 square foot facility, and the other operates out of a 45,000 square foot facility. The third cultivation license is located near the town of Beatty in Nye County, Nevada. The Beatty cultivation facility currently houses approximately 500 square feet of research and development and genetics testing with the potential to expand to over 2,300,000 square feet of greenhouse production capacity on 80 acres of owned land that includes municipal water and abundant electrical power already at the edge of the property. 
 
 Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Next Green Wave, LLC NGW, LLC ), which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, cultivate and process our cannabis products at our 35,875 square foot facility on one of the four properties utilized by us and zoned for cannabis cultivation in the City of Coalinga, California Facility A ). Facility A enables us to cultivate medicinal and adult-use cannabis and distribute cannabis products in accordance with the requirements under the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, throughout the State of California. 
 
 As part of our Florida expansion, on July 1, 2022, we closed on a 3,300,000 purchase of a 23-acre parcel of real property, inclusive of a 10,500 square foot building, near Ocala, Florida. We are in the beginning stages of establishing our cultivation operations at this property as we continue to strategically select dispensary locations across the State of Florida.

Production 
 
 Our six Nevada production licenses operate at three licensed production facilities, each location operating jointly under a medical and adult-use cultivation license. One production facility is a 18,500 square foot customer facing production facility that opened inside the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, our cannabis entertainment complex adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. In operation since October 2019, this facility incorporates butane hash oil (BHO) extraction, distillation equipment and microwave assisted extraction equipment as well as a state-of-the-art bottling and infused beverage line and an edibles line able to produce infused chocolates, infused gummies and other edible products. Prior to opening this facility, we produced our cannabis products at a separate 4,750 square foot facility leased in Las Vegas (Clark County). The second production facility is co-located at the Beatty facility, and the third facility is co-located in the 45,000 square foot cultivation facility located in Las Vegas. Manufactured products and Trendi-branded third-party flower are distributed through Nevada under our Nevada distribution license. 
 
 Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, in California, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGW, LLC, which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, process and package our cannabis products at our 4,000 square foot facility on one of the four properties utilized by us and zoned for cannabis cultivation in the City of Coalinga, California Facility C ). Facility C enables us to process and package medicinal and adult-use cannabis and distribute cannabis products in accordance with the requirements under the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, throughout the State of California. 
 
 Distribution 
 
 We currently operate Nevada distribution activities, primarily for the transport of our products between our cultivation, production, and dispensing operations, out of our 16,100 square foot cultivation facility located in Las Vegas (Clark County). In addition to self-distribution services, the distribution license is used for the delivery of our wholesale products to licensed Nevada-state cannabis retailers. All distribution licenses held by us in the State of Nevada have been issued to MMDC. 
 
 We currently operate California distribution activities at our licensed facility in Santa Ana, California to receive cannabis products purchased from our vendors prior to placement in the Planet 13 OC Superstore. 
 
 Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGW, LLC, which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, distribute our cannabis products from Facilities A and C to California-licensed wholesale customers. 
 
 Dispensing 
 
 We have three Nevada dispensary licenses, one for medical and two for the sale of adult-use product. Since 2018, the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, approximately 23,000 square feet of retail space located adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip, has housed one medical and one adult-use license. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore has the capacity to serve between 3,000 and 5,000 customers per day through its new, enhanced dispensary. We intend to build out the balance of the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore location with ancillary services such as a potential cannabis lounge in a segregated area of the facility where patrons will be able to consume products that have been purchased at the dispensary. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore also houses our corporate offices. Prior to relocating to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, the licenses operated out of the Medizin Facility, a 2,300 square foot facility located approximately six miles off the Las Vegas Strip. In September 2020, we received an unincorporated Clark County adult-use license for the Medizin Facility dispensary which had closed when its dispensary licenses were transferred to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore and re-opened the Medizin Facility on November 30, 2020. 
 
 The regulatory framework for consumption lounge applications and operations was finalized in July 2022. In December 2022, we were approved for a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge prospective license and continue to develop our buildout and operational plans. 
 
 We operate one dispensary in California, the Planet 13 OC Superstore, which occupies approximately 25,600 square feet of retail space on Warner Avenue in the City of Santa Ana located in Orange County. On March 3, 2023, we submitted a request to the DCC to add a medical designation to our dispensary license which will allow for the sale of medical cannabis products from the Planet 13 OC Superstore.

On August 5, 2021, our subsidiary, Planet 13 Illinois, which was then owned 49 by us and 51 by Frank Cowan, a resident of Illinois, was a lottery winner for a Social-Equity Justice Involved Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region from the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation in the State of Illinois. On February 7, 2023, we exercised and closed our option to purchase Mr. Cowan's 51 interest in Planet 13 Illinois. On October 5, 2021, we formed Planet 13 Chicago, LLC as a 100 owned leasing entity to support future operations in Illinois. On February 3, 2023, we closed on the purchase of a dispensary location in the town of Waukegan, a suburb of the greater Chicago area, and anticipate that it will be operational in mid to late 2023. 
 
 Our Florida MMTC license authorizes us to dispense medical marijuana to qualified patients and caregivers. As of the date of this report, we have entered into four leases for dispensing locations in Florida which remain subject to completion of tenant improvements and regulatory inspection prior to sales to customers.

Uses of Cannabis 
 
 Cannabis can be vaporized, smoked or ingested to alleviate pain and other ailments. Since 2014, we have been cultivating and selling cannabis in Nevada within the price range from US 6.00 to US 21.00 per gram, depending on the strain. Typically, growth time and strain yield will determine whether a strain is low or high priced. Very particular strains may be priced higher than the given range, but this would be the exception. 
 
 We offer our customers a diverse range of products, including cannabis flowers, cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products. In total, we currently offer over 100 cannabis strains at our dispensaries, up to 20 of which are proprietary strains grown in-house in Nevada and up to 15 strains grown at the recently acquired Next Green Wave cultivation facility in California, covering the entire cannabis spectrum. We believe that carrying a popular variety of strains of medical and adult-use cannabis is essential to long-term success. Each strain of medical cannabis is different. Some of the factors that impact whether a particular strain may be right for a customer include levels of THC and/or CBD and whether the plant strain is a Sativa, Indica or Hybrid genetic variant. 
 
 We believe that we can gain a competitive advantage by growing high yielding strains which are good extractors and which mature in a short growing cycle while still providing the desired THC profile. Further, finding the right product for a customer s condition or needs may require sampling a variety of strains, as every person is different. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA has not recognized or approved cannabis as safe or effective for any indication. 
 
 Our cultivation, production, distribution and marketing business is currently focused on the medical and adult-use segments, with product offerings sold through our own licensed retail dispensaries as well as third party dispensaries in both California and Nevada. 
 
 Principal Products 
 
 We currently operate the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, a 24,000 square foot licensed cannabis dispensary located near the Las Vegas Strip, from which we: (i) dispense medical (Medizin) and retail (Planet 13) product lines and provides customer experiences through entertainment features (ii) provide the consultation, education and convenience services described below and (iii) own and operate Trece Eatery + Spirits as well as operate a non-cannabis retail merchandise store and event space. Our principal products are cannabis and cannabis-infused items sold to consumers in the medical and retail cannabis markets in the State of Nevada. We sell more than 123 strains of cannabis, up to 35 of which are grown in-house by us. 
 
 Co-located with the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore complex, we operate a customer-viewable production facility manufacturing wholesale edible and concentrate products, include the TRENDI line, the Leaf Vine line Dreamland Chocolates, HaHa gummies and sparkling beverages. These products are sold in-store and wholesale to 57 other dispensaries in Nevada. 
 
 We also operate the Medizin dispensary, reopened in November 2020, and operate the Planet 13 OC Superstore dispensary in Santa Ana, California which opened on July 1, 2021. 
 
 Through our cultivation and production facilities in Nevada and California, we manufacture and sell brands at wholesale to licensed dispensaries. 
 
 Competition 
 
 With respect to retail operations, we compete with other retail license holders across Nevada and California. In addition to physical dispensaries, we also compete with third-party delivery services which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services in Nevada and California. In terms of cultivation and production, we compete with other licensed cultivators and operators in Nevada, California, and other states in which we may operate in the future. 
 
 Other than the Nevada state cap on licenses and California local jurisdictional caps on licenses, the retail markets in Nevada and California have fewer barriers to entry and more closely reflect free market dynamics typically seen in mature retail and manufacturing industries. The growth of these markets poses a risk of increased competition. However, given that we have entered the Nevada and California cannabis market at an early stage, management views our market share as less at risk than operators without a current operating footprint. 
 
 Management also believes that there are a number of illegally operating dispensaries and cultivators in Nevada and California which serve as competition to us. We expect, however, that the majority of these illegal dispensaries and cultivators will be forced to cease operations in the near-term. See Risk Factors.

Components 
 
 The main raw materials and components used in the production of our products are cannabis seeds and clones, water, plant nutrients, and electricity. 
 
 Water for our Clark County, Nye County, and Fresno County operations is obtained from the respective municipal water systems. The price of water is determined by the respective local governments. 
 
 Raw materials include soil, nutrients, organic integrated pest and disease management, environmental supplementation, disposable supplies, and other miscellaneous inputs, all of which are readily available from multiple sources at wholesale or lower prices. 
 
 Cycles 
 
 There have been potential seasonal fluctuations observed in the first few years of operations at the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, reflective of the Las Vegas market specifically, as well as industry-wide cannabis-themed holidays and events. These potential seasonal fluctuations have been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have presented the industry and the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore with a unique set of opportunities and challenges. As at the date hereof, we do not know the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the previously observed trends. Our Planet 13 OC Superstore location opened July 1, 2021 and has a limited operating history. We are continuing to monitor the seasonal fluctuations at this location. 
 
 Intellectual Property 
 
 We have applied for trademarks at Nevada state and federal level, some of which are currently pending for Medizin, Planet 13, TRENDI, Leaf Vine, HaHa, and Dreamland. In California, we have registrations for Planet 13 and Planet M. These trademarks were applied for and are designed for use on clothing, wearables, and other non-cannabis products with the intent of creating a valuable brand. We intend to file for additional intellectual property rights in the future. 
 
 Environmental 
 
 We do not anticipate that environmental protection requirements will have a material financial or operational effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position in the current financial year or in future years. 
 
 Human Capital 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 567 full-time and 67 part-time employees, and anticipate that number will increase as we expand our operations in California, Florida, Illinois, and Nevada. Full time employees are distributed among several departments, including sales, management and administration, security, cultivation, operations, marketing, facilities, human resources, finance, accounting and legal. In order to ensure that the motivation, integrity and culture of our team stays strong, our Board of Directors (the Board and executive team put significant focus on our human capital resources. 
 
 We are committed to diversity and to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants. This commitment extends to all of our employment practices including recruiting, hiring, training, promotions, and benefits. 
 
 Our goal is to use the highest standards in attracting and training the best talent. Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom to hire are among our most important activities. We utilize professional services, industry groups, social media, local job fairs, and educational organizations across the country to find diverse, motivated, and responsible employees. It is a requirement that all of our employees pass background checks and drug screening. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. These programs include employee mentoring and one-on-one quality and regulatory training sessions overseen by our Human Resources Department and Regulatory Compliance team. 
 
 The main objective of our compensation program is to attract, retain, motivate, and reward superior employees who must operate in a quick-paced and customer-focused environment. To accomplish this, we offer a package of company-sponsored benefits to our employees. Eligibility depends on each employee s full-time or part-time status, location, and other factors, and benefits include medical and dental plans, paid and unpaid leaves, and flexible time-off. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. Additionally, we believe in aligned incentives and utilize share unit and stock option plans as well as annual bonuses to align the long-term compensation of eligible directors, employees, officers, and contractors with our shareholders interests for a competitive total rewards program.

Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 
 United States Federal Law Overview 
 
 At the federal level, cannabis currently remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substance Act of 1970 (the CSA ). Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. As such, the manufacture, importation, possession, use or distribution of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law. This has created a dichotomy between state and federal law, whereby many states have elected to regulate and remove state-level penalties regarding a substance that is still illegal at the federal level. As of December 31, 2022, and despite the conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized cannabis for medical use. Twenty-one of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult use of cannabis for recreational purposes. 
 
 While technically illegal, the U.S. federal government s approach to enforcement of such laws has, at least until recently, trended toward non-enforcement. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ issued a memorandum known as the Cole Memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys offices (federal prosecutors). The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that rigorously comply with state regulatory provisions in states with strictly-regulated medical or adult-use cannabis programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning state-regulated cannabis businesses. 
 
 However, on January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was revoked by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law - as the Cole Memorandum was not itself law - the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where cannabis use is regulated. Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the Sessions Memorandum . This confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was unnecessary due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney s Manual (the USAM ). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the federal government s limited resources, and include law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. 
 
 While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and states the statutory view that it is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime, it does not otherwise guide U.S. Attorneys that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys in deciding whether to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. U.S. Attorneys could individually continue to exercise their discretion in a manner similar to that displayed under the Cole Memorandum s guidance. Dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country have affirmed their commitment to proceeding in this manner, or otherwise affirming that their view of federal enforcement priorities has not changed, although a few have displayed greater ambivalence. 
 
 On January 21, 2021, Joseph Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Mr. Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a good use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. On October 6, 2022, President Biden announced "First: I'm pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession ... Second: I'm calling on all governors to pardon simple state marijuana possession offenses ... Third: ... I'm asking [Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra] and the Attorney General to initiate the process of reviewing how marijuana is scheduled under federal law." Despite these statements which appear positive for the nascent cannabis industry, there is no guarantee that cannabis will be rescheduled federally, that current state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.

In addition to federal illegality and uncertainty of state-driven legalization frameworks for cannabis operators within the U.S., it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the U.S., could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. 
 
 Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the FinCEN Memorandum outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report SAR in connection with all marijuana-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These marijuana-related SARs are divided into three categories - marijuana limited, marijuana priority, and marijuana terminated - based on the financial institution s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day as the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the 2014 DOJ Memorandum directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 DOJ Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority. 
 
 However, former Attorney General Sessions revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 DOJ Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 DOJ Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum appears to be a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, in the United States, it is difficult for cannabis-based businesses to open and maintain a bank account with any bank or other financial institution. 
 
 In the U.S., the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, H.R. 1595 SAFE Banking Act ), was first introduced on March 7, 2019 and passed a vote on September 25, 2019 by the Committee of the Whole Congress, but failed to receive the support needed to pass the U.S. Senate. Generally, the act would let banks offer services to cannabis-related businesses. They could also offer services to those businesses employees. In both Canada and the U.S., transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions. The SAFE Banking Act re-emerged in March 2021, H.R. 1996, with more bipartisan support including with 180 cosponsors. On April 19, 2021, the House passed the re-introduced SAFE Banking Act in a bipartisan vote of 321 - 101, but it again stalled in the Senate. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for the SAFE Banking Act and similar legislation, there can be no assurance that it will be passed as presently proposed or at all. 
 
 Although the Cole Memorandum and 2014 DOJ Memorandum have been rescinded, Congress has used the Joyce Amendment, previously known as the Rohrabacher-Farr and the Rohrabacher-Leahy Amendment, as a rider provision in the FY 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Acts and accompanying stopgap spending measures to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. President Joe Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Joyce Amendment included. Most recently, on December 29, 2022, the Joyce Amendment was renewed through the signing of the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023" which extended the protections for the medical cannabis industry until September 30, 2023. 
 
 Despite the legal, regulatory, and political obstacles the cannabis industry currently faces, the industry has continued to grow. It was anticipated that the federal government would eventually repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit regulated cannabis cultivation, production and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco.

Given current political trends, however, these developments are considered unlikely to materialize in the near-term. As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we intend to abide by the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum: 

ensure that our operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions 

ensure that our cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example, in states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements) 

implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors 

implement policies and procedures in place to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels 

implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or cross any state lines in general 

ensure that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, is engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes and 

ensure that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. 

In addition, we may (and frequently do) conduct background checks to ensure that the principals and management of our operating subsidiaries are of good character and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis. We also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of our cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation. 
 
 Nevada State Law Overview 
 
 In 2000, Nevada voters passed a medical marijuana initiative allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying conditions including chronic pain and created a limited non-commercial medical marijuana patient/caregiver system. Senate Bill 374, which passed the legislature and was signed by the Nevada Governor in 2013, expanded this program and established a for-profit regulated medical marijuana industry. 
 
 In 2014, Nevada accepted medical marijuana business applications and a few months later the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (the Division approved 182 cultivation licenses, 118 licenses for the production of edibles and infused products, 17 independent testing laboratories, and 55 medical marijuana dispensary licenses. The number of dispensary licenses was then increased to 66 by legislative action in 2015. The application process was merit-based, competitive, and is currently closed. 
 
 Nevada has a medical marijuana program and passed adult-use legalization through the ballot box in November 2016. Under Nevada s adult-use marijuana law, the state licensed marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, distributors, retail stores and testing facilities. For the first 18 months after legalization, applications to the DOT for adult- use establishment licenses were only accepted from existing medical marijuana establishments and from existing liquor distributors for the adult-use distribution license. The Division licensed and regulated medical marijuana establishments up until July 1, 2017, when the state s medical marijuana program merged with adult-use marijuana enforcement under the DOT. After merging medical and adult-use marijuana regulation and enforcement, the single regulatory agency was known as the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Taxation . The DOT oversaw regulation of cannabis operations until the CCB took over on July 1, 2020. As of October 5, 2020, all five members of the CCB were appointed by the Nevada Governor.

In February 2017, the state announced plans to issue early start recreational marijuana establishment licenses in the summer of 2017. These licenses expired at the end of the year and, beginning on July 1, 2017, allowed marijuana establishments holding both a retail marijuana store and dispensary license to sell their existing medical marijuana inventory as either medical or adult-use marijuana. All cannabis cultivated and infused products produced under the adult-use program that were not existing inventory at a medical marijuana dispensary were transported to retail marijuana stores utilizing a licensed retail marijuana distributor. Starting on July 1, 2017, medical and adult-use marijuana became subject to a 15 excise tax on the first wholesale sale (calculated on the fair market value) and adult-use cannabis is subject to an additional 10 special retail marijuana sales tax in addition to any general state and local sales and use taxes. 
 
 The regular retail marijuana program began in early 2018. The Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act specifies that, for the first 18 months of the program, only existing medical marijuana establishment certificate holders could apply for a retail marijuana establishment license. As that restriction expired in November 2018, on December 5, 2018, the DOT expanded the application process and awarded an additional 61 licenses for retail marijuana dispensaries in Nevada. The regular program was governed by permanent regulations found in Nevada Administrative Code Sections 453A and 453D through June 30, 2020. 
 
 In early 2019, Nevada legislature passed Nevada Assembly Bill 533 AB533 ), which authorized the formation of the CCB to be vested with the authority to license and regulate persons and establishments engaged in cannabis activities within Nevada and promulgated statutes which will replace Nevada Revised Statute NRS 453A and 453D effective on July 1, 2020. Those statutes are currently codified at NRS 678A, B, C and D. On July 21, 2020, the CCB adopted final Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations 1 through 14 NCCR which are substantially similar to the former Nevada Administrative Code Sections 453A and 453D. 
 
 In response to industry feedback, on October 20, 2020, the CCB amended NCCR 5 to give clarity regarding public company ownership of Nevada cannabis companies. Generally, those amendments include such companies being required to provide to the CCB notice of annual general meetings of shareholders and a non-objecting beneficial owners NOBO list as of the record date of each such meeting, and disclosure of any stockholders having 5 or greater ownership interest or that are able to exert control over a Nevada cannabis establishment. Additionally, the CCB requires an updated list of all beneficial owners, regardless of amount or type of ownership, but if a list of all beneficial owners cannot be obtained through reasonable cost and/or effort, the publicly traded company must provide an updated NOBO list as of the annual meeting record date, and explain why it cannot provide a list of all beneficial owners through reasonable cost and effort. 
 
 Nevada does not have any U.S. residency requirements with respect to license ownership, but does require background checks of all individuals having an ownership interest. Background checks are waivable at the discretion of the CCB for individuals having less than 5 ownership interest. The last background check waiver approval received from CCB was a request we submitted on November 30, 2020 in relation to the acquisition of the conditional Nevada distribution license acquired from WCDN, but which extended to all shareholders holding less than 5 ownership interest. We also submitted a background check waiver request to the CCB on January 3, 2022 in relation to the Arrangement Agreement, which may or may not be acted upon by the CCB (see Risk Factors ). Although the CCB has not chosen to exercise their authority to require a background check on ownership interests in public cannabis companies that remain under 5 and do not otherwise exercise control over a Nevada cannabis licensee, the CCB does have authority to require a licensee to investigate and submit any ownership interest, beneficial or direct, for CCB approval. For example, under Nevada cannabis laws, any beneficial holder of any of our securities, regardless of the number of shares, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the CCB has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. 
 
 In addition, vertical integration is neither required nor prohibited. All medical cannabis sales are made subject to the recipient holding a registry identification card issued by the State of Nevada as defined at NRS 678C.080. We are permitted to sell medical cannabis products to non-Nevada patients as non-Nevada patients are permitted reciprocity under NRS 678C.470. 
 
 Nevada Reporting Requirements 
 
 Nevada has selected Franwell Inc. s METRC solution METRC as the state s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement through the supply chain. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. For all licensed facilities, we have designated an in-house computerized seed to sale software that integrates with METRC via an application programming interface, and captures the required data points for cultivation, production and retail as required by Nevada statutes and regulations.

Nevada Licenses and Regulatory Compliance 
 
 We are licensed for the cultivation, production, distribution, and retail sale of cannabis and cannabis products. These licenses were formerly issued by the DOT under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A through June 30, 2020 and reissued by the CCB under NRS 678A, B and D starting July 1, 2020. All licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities and retail locations in Nevada. 
 
 Cannabis consumption lounges were authorized in Nevada pursuant to AB 341 in the 2021 81st Session of the Nevada Legislature. On July 9, 2021, our subsidiary MMDC received a notification letter of eligibility to hold a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge license from the CCB. On June 28, 2022, the CCB adopted regulations for the cannabis consumption lounge application and requirements to operate. In December 2022, we were approved for a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge prospective license and continue to develop our buildout and operational plans. 
 Our licenses are in good standing and we, through MMDC, are in compliance with Nevada s cannabis regulatory program. MMDC has responded to all CCB inspections and received approval on all corrective actions. 
 
 We comply with applicable Nevada state licensing requirements as follows: (i) MMDC is licensed pursuant to applicable Nevada state law to cultivate, possess and/or distribute THC- bearing cannabis in Nevada (ii) renewal dates for such licenses are docketed by legal counsel and/or other advisors (iii) random audits of our business activities are conducted by the applicable Nevada state regulator and by us to ensure compliance with applicable Nevada state law (iv) each of our employees is provided with an employee handbook that outlines internal standard operating procedures in connection the cultivation, possession and distribution of cannabis to ensure that all cannabis inventory and proceeds from the sale of such cannabis are properly accounted for and tracked, including through the use of scanners to confirm each customer s legal age and the validity of each customer s photo identification (v) each room that cannabis inventory and/or proceeds from the sale of such inventory enter is monitored by video surveillance (vi) software is used to track cannabis inventory from seed to sale. We are contractually obligated to comply with applicable Nevada state law in connection with the cultivation, possession and/or distribution of cannabis in Nevada. 
 
 All Nevada cannabis establishments must be licensed by the CCB. If applications contain all required information and after vetting of officers, establishments are issued a cannabis establishment registration certificate. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by the CCB of a cannabis establishment license is considered conditional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and the establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Final licenses are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. It is important to note that conditional licenses do not permit the operation of any commercial or medical cannabis businesses. Only after a conditional licensee has gone through necessary state and local inspections, if applicable, and has received a final license from the CCB may an entity engage in cannabis business operation. The CCB limits applications for all licenses. 
 
 We have a full time General Counsel on staff in Nevada, who is a licensed attorney under the State Bar of Nevada, in good standing, whose responsibilities include monitoring the day-to-day activities of regulatory compliance staff, including ensuring that the established standard operating procedures are being adhered to at each stage of the cultivation, processing and distribution cycle, to identify any non-compliance matters and to put in place the necessary modifications to ensure compliance. The regulatory compliance staff conducts regular unannounced audits against our established standard operating procedures and State of Nevada regulations. Each employee is provided with an employee handbook outlining the standard operating procedures and state regulations upon hiring and is then provided with one-on-one quality and regulatory training through programs overseen by the General Counsel. 
 
 California State Law Overview 
 
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. 
 
 In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients. In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MCRSA ). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult-Use of Marijuana Act AUMA creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older.

Table of Contents 

AUMA included certain conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MAUCRSA ), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. At that time the four agencies that regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control BCC ), California Department of Food and Agriculture, California Department of Public Health, and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA came into effect on January 1, 2018. One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as local control. In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators, or can choose to outright ban marijuana. 
 
 State cannabis licenses in California must be renewed annually. Depending on the jurisdiction, our local authorizations must generally be renewed annually as well. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per State cannabis regulatory guidelines. Provided renewal applications are submitted in a timely manner, we can expect the renewals to be granted in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 On January 10, 2020, the three commercial cannabis licensing agencies in California, the BCC, the Department of Food and Agriculture, and the Department of Public Health (collectively, California Licensing Agencies announced that California Governor Gavin Newsom s budget proposal for cannabis industry regulation and taxation included plans to consolidate the three licensing entities that are currently housed at the California Licensing Agencies into a single Department of Cannabis Control by July 2021. With the passage of AB 141 on July 12, 2021, the California Licensing Agencies were consolidated into the Department of Cannabis Control DCC ). On September 8, 2021, the DCC announced proposed emergency regulations to move all cannabis regulations into Title 4 of the California Code of Regulations, with a stated goal of consolidating and improving the regulations. Effective November 7, 2022, the DCC made permanent the emergency regulations adopted on September 27, 2021, and March 28, 2022. The DCC adopted a consolidated regulatory package that streamlines and simplifies cannabis regulations, eases burdens for licensees, and enhances consumer and youth protections. DCC proposed changes to the current regulations are available to track online at: https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/rulemaking/ . 
 
 MAUCRSA allows local municipalities and jurisdictions to authorize the on-site consumption of cannabis by state-licensed retailers and/or microbusinesses. If a city or county permits it, retailers and microbusinesses can have on-site consumption if: (i) access to the area where cannabis consumption is allowed is restricted to persons 21 years of age and older, (ii) cannabis consumption is not visible from any public place or non age-restricted area, and (iii) the sale or consumption of alcohol or tobacco is not allowed on the premises.

 California has selected METRC as the state s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the supply chain. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. For all licensed facilities, we have designated an in- house computerized seed to sale software that integrates with METRC via an application programming interface, and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required by California statutes and regulations. 
 
 California License and Regulatory Compliance 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we, through our subsidiary Newtonian, hold the Santa Ana Permit and the California License and are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of California. In order to qualify for these licenses, we submitted applications and license renewals with detailed plans and procedures evidencing to the applicable regulators that it complies with all statutory and regulatory requirements in California for the operation of the licenses. We have further retained a California regulatory consultant, with experience operating regulatory-compliant California license operations, to advise us on regulatory requirements and updates in that state. Upon closing of the Arrangement, we filed a notice of ownership update with the State of California, and assumed responsibility for the NGW licenses. Additionally, our General Counsel works regularly with our California regulatory consultant and oversees all aspects of services provided in connection with the Santa Ana Permit, the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution licenses acquired pursuant to the Arrangement completed on March 2, 2022, and the California License to ensure compliance and continuity of those licenses.

Florida State Law Overview 
 
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, which was the first legal medical cannabis program in the state s history. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed on November 8. This language, known as Amendment 2 , amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state s medical cannabis program. 
 
 Amendment 2, and the resulting expansion of qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations and patients are bound by Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and Florida Statutes Section 381.986. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017. 
 
 The Florida Statutes Section 381.986(8) provides a regulatory framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers , to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically-integrated marketplace. 
 
 Licenses are issued by the Office of Medical Marijuana Use OMMU and must be renewed biennially. License holders can only own one license. Currently, the dispensaries can be in any geographic location within the state, provided that the local jurisdiction s zoning regulations authorize such a use, the proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and the site is not within 500 feet of a school. 
 
 The MMTC license permits us to sell medical cannabis to qualified patients to treat certain medical conditions in Florida, which are delineated in Florida Statutes Section 381.986. As we expect our operations in Florida to be vertically-integrated, we will be able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver our own medical cannabis products. Under the terms of our Florida license, we are permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the State. Only qualified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients on the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use Registry. 
 
 Florida Reporting Requirements 
 
 Florida law calls for the OMMU to establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of certain events, including when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical marijuana treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU. At this time the OMMU has not implemented a statewide seed-to-sale tracking system. Additionally, the OMMU also maintains a patient and physician registry and the licensee must comply with all requirements and regulations relative to the provision of required data or proof of key events to said system in order to retain its license. Florida requires all MMTCs to abide by representations made in their original application to the State of Florida or any subsequent variances to same. Any changes or expansions of previous representations and disclosures to the OMMU must be approved by the OMMU via a variance process. 
 
 Security and Storage Requirements 
 
 Adequate outdoor lighting is required from dusk to dawn for all MMTC facilities. 24-hour per day video surveillance is required and all MMTCs must maintain at least a rolling 45-day period that is made available to law enforcement and the OMMU upon demand. Alarm systems must be active at all times for all entry points and windows. Interior spaces must also have motion detectors and all cameras must have an unobstructed view of key areas. Panic alarms must also be available for employees to be able to signal authorities when needed. 
 
 In dispensaries, the MMTC must provide a waiting area with a sufficient seating area. There must also be a minimum of one private consultation/education room for the privacy of the patient(s) and their caregiver (if applicable). The MMTC may only dispense products between 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. All active products must be kept in a secure location within the dispensary and only empty packaging may be kept in the general area of the dispensary which is readily accessible to customers and visitors. No product or delivery devices may be on display in, or visible from, the waiting area. 

22

Table of Contents 

An MMTC must at all times provide secure and logged access for all cannabis materials. This includes approved vaults or locked rooms. There must be at least two employees of the MMTC or an approved security provider on site at all times where cultivation, processing, or storing of cannabis occurs. All employees must wear proper identification badges and visitors must be logged in and wear a visitor badge while on the premises. The MMTC must report any suspected activity of loss, diversion or theft of cannabis materials within 24 hours of becoming aware of such an occurrence. 
 
 Florida Transportation Requirements 
 
 When transporting cannabis to dispensaries or to patients, a manifest must be prepared and transportation must be done using an approved vehicle. The cannabis must be stored in a separate, locked area of the vehicle and at all times while in transit there must be two people in a delivery vehicle. During deliveries, one person must remain with the vehicle. The delivery employees must at all times have identification badges. The manifest must include the following information: (i) departure date and time (ii) name, address and license number of the originating MMTC (iii) name and address of the receiving entity (iv) the quantity, form and delivery device of the cannabis (v) arrival date and time (vi) the make, model and license plate of the delivery vehicle and (vii) the name and signatures of the MMTC delivery employees. These manifests must be kept by the MMTC for inspection for up to three years. During the delivery, a copy of the manifest is also provided to the recipient. 
 
 OMMU Inspections in Florida 
 
 The OMMU may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of MMTC s to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OMMU is to inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed cannabis containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. The OMMU is to conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices. 
 
 Florida License and Regulatory Compliance 
 
 We, through our subsidiary, Planet 13 Florida, hold the MMTC license and are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Florida. We have retained Florida regulatory consultants with experience to advise us on regulatory requirement and updates in that state. Our General Counsel works regularly with our Florida regulatory consultant and oversees all aspects of statutory and regulatory compliance for our MMTC license. 
 
 Illinois State Law Overview 
 
 In June 2019, Illinois passed the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act CRTA ), which legalized cannabis for recreational use and created one of the largest adult use markets in the country. The law went into effect on June 25, 2019, and adult use sales of cannabis began in the state on January 1, 2020. Under the CRTA, existing medical cannabis license holders were allowed to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization EAAUDO licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical cannabis dispensaries (known as co-located or same site dispensaries). Existing medical operators also received the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail dispensary for every medical cannabis dispensary location already existing in the operator s portfolio. All EAAUDO license holders were also required to commit to Illinois s groundbreaking Social Equity program either through a financial contribution, grant agreement, donation, incubation program, or sponsorship program. 
 
 The CRTA also authorized the issuance of an additional 75 Adult Use Dispensing Organization AUDO licenses, 40 craft grower licenses as well as infuser and transporter licenses in 2020. Generally speaking, these licenses were to be awarded via a competitive application process. The CRTA provided a significant advantage to applicants that qualified as a Social Equity Applicant under the CRTA. In addition, the CRTA authorized issuance up to 110 additional AUDO licenses and 60 craft grower licenses by December 21, 2021. However, due the COVID-19 pandemic, litigation relating to the application process, and the passage of H.B. 1443, which amended the CRTA, the issuance of new cannabis licenses in Illinois was delayed until July 2021. By June 2022, the Illinois Department of Agriculture (" IDOA ") has issued approximately 88 craft grower licenses in several tranches, along with infuser and transporter licenses. Note that those applicants who did not win a craft grow license have since sued IDOA alleging a host of issues and arguments relating to the application and scoring process. All such cases were consolidated for administrative purposes and are still pending In re Cannabis Craft Grow Litigation , Case No.: 22 CH 06071). 

On September 3, 2021, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (" IDFPR ") announced that 185 Conditional AUDO licenses have been awarded through three license lotteries that took place on July 29, 2021, August 5, 2021, and August 19, 2021 respectively. These Conditional AUDO licenses were ultimately issued to the respective winners in July 2022. Conditional AUDO license holders are required to site and operationalize their dispensaries within 360 days of license receipt.

Illinois Reporting Requirements 
 
 The state of Illinois uses BioTrackTHC as its computerized track-and-trace system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. 
 
 Illinois Licenses and Regulatory Compliance 
 
 Illinois allows for five types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation centers; (2) craft growers (3) infusers (4) transporters which are regulated by the IDOA. Fifth are dispensaries, which are regulated by IDFPR. 
 
 All cultivation, infusing, and transporter establishments must register with IDOA. All dispensaries must register with the IDFPR. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Pursuant to Illinois law, registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the license has a history of non-compliance and penalties. 
 
 The cultivation licenses permit a licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture and process cannabis into edible products and cannabis-infused products. Cultivators can transfer, have tested, supply or sell cannabis and cannabis products and related supplies to licensed dispensaries, craft growers, and infusers. Infusing licenses permit a licensee to acquire and possess distillate from a licensed cultivator or craft grower and to manufacture edible and cannabis-infused products. Infusers can transfer, have tested, supply or sell cannabis and cannabis products to dispensaries. The transporter license permits a licensee to transport cannabis and cannabis products to and from licensed entities. 
 
 The retail dispensary license permits us to purchase cannabis and manufactured cannabis products from licensed cultivation facilities, craft growers, and infusing organizations and to sell such products to adult consumers (21 years old or older). 
 
 On August 5, 2021, we, through our subsidiary, Planet 13 Illinois, in which entity we held a minority interest, won a Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region, the most populated region of Illinois. The conditional license was issued to Planet 13 Illinois on July 22, 2022 and expires on July 17, 2023. Such a license will cease to be "conditional" once it is tethered to an approved location. 
 
 On February 7, 2023, and upon the receipt of regulatory approval from IDFPR, we exercised our option to purchase the majority interest of Planet 13 Illinois. As such, we are now the 100 owner of that license holding entity. 
 
 We have retained Illinois regulatory counsel, with experience to advise us on regulatory requirements during the pre-license issuance period and following the anticipated annual license issuance to Planet 13 Illinois. Our General Counsel works regularly with our Illinois regulatory counsel and oversees all aspects of statutory and regulatory compliance. 
 
 Compliance with State Law 
 
 We are in compliance with California, Nevada, Illinois, and Florida laws and the related licensing framework. We use reasonable commercial efforts to confirm, through the advice of our General Counsel and local consultants, through the monitoring and review of our business practices, and through regular monitoring of changes to U.S. Federal enforcement priorities, that our businesses are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by the states in which we operate. Our General Counsel works with external legal advisors in Nevada, California, Illinois, and Florida to ensure that we and our subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable state laws, including: 

frequent correspondence and updates with advisors 

development and maintenance of standard operating procedures with respect to dispensing, cultivation, processing and distribution 

ongoing monitoring of compliance with operating procedures and regulations by on-site management 

appropriate employee training for all standard operating procedures and 

subscription to monitoring programs to ensure compliance with the FinCEN Memorandum. 

24

Table of Contents 

We have not received any noncompliance orders, citations or notices of violation that remain uncorrected or that may have an ongoing impact on our licenses, business activities or operations. 
 
 In addition, we will continue to ensure we are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in the states in which we operate by continuous review of our licenses and affirmation certifications from management. Each new license received by us undergoes both internal and independent reviews, and is subject to all compliance monitoring and requirements that are applied to existing licenses held or controlled by us. While our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local law, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. 
 
 Storage and Security 
 
 To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, we do the following in full compliance with state statutes and regulations: 

have an enclosed, locked facility, with appropriate entrance security 

train employees in security measures and controls, emergency response protocol, confidentiality requirements, safe handling of equipment, procedures for handling products, as well as the differences in strains, methods of consumption, methods of cultivation, methods of fertilization and methods for health monitoring 

install sophisticated, regulatory-compliant security equipment to deter and prevent unauthorized entrances 

install security alarms to alert local law enforcement of unauthorized breach of security and 

implement security procedures that: 

restrict access of the establishment to only those persons/employees authorized to be there 

deter and prevent theft 

provide identification (badge) for those persons/employees authorized to be in the establishment 

prevent loitering 

require and explain electronic monitoring and 

require and explain the use of automatic or electronic notification to alert local law enforcement of an unauthorized breach of security. 

Regulatory Risks 
 
 The U.S. cannabis industry is highly regulated, highly competitive and evolving rapidly. As such, new risks may emerge, and management may not be able to predict all such risks or be able to predict how such risks may impact on actual results. 
 
 Participants in the U.S. cannabis industry will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions of operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, we may be subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

The U.S. cannabis industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants. The marketability of any product may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond our control and which cannot be predicted, such as changes to government regulations, including those relating to taxes and other government levies which may be imposed. Changes in government levies, including taxes, could reduce our earnings and could make future growth uneconomic. The industry is also subject to numerous legal challenges, which may significantly affect our financial condition and which cannot be reliably predicted. 
 
 We expect to derive all of our revenues from the U.S. cannabis industry, which industry is illegal under U.S. federal law. As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation. We began our operations in the State of Nevada, which has legalized the medical and adult-use of cannabis, and have expanded or plan to expand in other states with licensed cannabis opportunities. The U.S. federal government has not enacted similar legislation and the cultivation, sale and use of cannabis remains illegal under federal law pursuant to the CSA. The federal government of the U.S. has specifically reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis even if state law sanctioned such sale and disbursement. It is presently unclear whether the U.S. federal government intends to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis where the conduct at issue is legal under applicable state law. This risk was further heightened by the revocation of the Cole Memorandum in January 2018. See United States Federal Law Overview . 
 
 Further, there can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local government authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business in the cannabis industry. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing state laws are repealed or curtailed, then our business would be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 U.S. federal actions against any individual or entity engaged in the cannabis industry or a substantial repeal of cannabis related legislation could adversely affect us. Our involvement in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry is illegal under the applicable federal laws of the United States and may be illegal under other applicable law. There can be no assurances the federal government of the United States or other jurisdictions will not seek to enforce the applicable laws against us. The consequences of such enforcement would be materially adverse to our business and could result in the forfeiture or seizure of all or substantially all of our assets. See Risk Factors . 
 
 Nature of the Company s Involvement in the U.S. Cannabis Industry 
 
 We have a material direct involvement in the cannabis industry in Nevada and California. Currently, we are directly engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and production, possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis in the medical and adult-use cannabis marketplace in Nevada and California. As of December 31, 2022, we hold an MMTC license in Florida and a Conditional Adult-Use Dispensing Organization license in Illinois which we intend to place into operation. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, virtually all of our assets and revenues are directly attributable to the medical and adult-use cannabis market. We hold cultivation, production, dispensary, and distribution licenses for the State of Nevada and cultivation, manufacturing, dispensary, and distribution licenses for the State of California. 
 
 As previously stated, violations of any federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on us, including our reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of our securities on any stock exchange, our financial position, operating results and profitability. In addition, it is difficult for us to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or their final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. See Risk Factors . 
 
 Our operations in the U.S. cannabis industry are presently only in the States of Nevada and California and we currently hold licenses in Illinois and Florida. We may, in future periods, expand our operations outside of Nevada and California and intend to restrict such future expansion to: (i) only those states that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis and (ii) only those states where we can comply with state (and local) laws and regulations and have the licenses, permits or authorizations to properly carry on each element of our business. 
 
 In addition, we will continue to ensure we are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in the states in which we operate by continuous review of our licenses and affirmation certifications from management. 

26

Table of Contents 

We will continue to monitor, evaluate and re-assess the regulatory framework in the states in which we operate and any state that we may look to expand our operations to in the future, and the federal laws applicable thereto, on an ongoing basis and will update our continuous disclosure regarding government policy changes or new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding cannabis in the U.S as required. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations 
 
 We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 Bank Secrecy Act ), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 USA PATRIOT Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the U.S. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. 
 
 Our activities, and any proceeds thereof, may be considered proceeds of crime due to the fact that cannabis remains illegal federally in the U.S. This may restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions. Furthermore, while we have no current intention to declare or pay dividends on our Common Shares in the foreseeable future, we may decide to, or be required to, suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time. 
 
 Ability to Access Private and Public Capital 
 
 Prior to the RTO, we relied entirely on access to private capital in order to support our continuing operations and capital expenditure requirements. We expect to rely on both private and public capital markets to finance our growth plans in the U.S. legal cannabis industry. However, there is no assurance we will be successful, in whole or in part, in raising funds, particularly if the U.S. federal authorities change their position toward enforcing the CSA. Further, access to funding from U.S. residents may be limited due their unwillingness to be associated with activities which violate U.S. federal laws.

Risks Related to Regulation and our Industry 
 
 Cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under the CSA and our business model, and the nature of our operations could result in adverse actions by agencies of the U.S. federal government, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Unlike in Canada, which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of medical cannabis under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada) and the Cannabis Act (Canada), in the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. To date, a total of 39 states, Washington D.C., and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, have legalized medical cannabis in some form, and 15 of those states, Washington D.C., and the territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands have legalized recreational cannabis. 
 
 If the DOJ policy were to aggressively pursue financiers or equity owners of cannabis-related business, and United States attorneys followed such DOJ policies through pursuing prosecutions, then we could face: (i) seizure of our cash and other assets used to support or derived from our cannabis subsidiaries and (ii) the arrest of our employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, who could face charges of ancillary criminal violations of the CSA for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the CSA by virtue of providing financial support to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis. Additionally, as has recently been affirmed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our employees, directors, officers, managers and investors who are not U.S. citizens face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States for life. 
 
 Our primary businesses (owned directly or through one or more of our operating companies) are intended to be leading cultivators and dispensaries of cannabis and cannabis-infused products in the State of Nevada and other U.S. states. Because the production and sale of recreational cannabis remain illegal under federal law, it is possible that our future suppliers (and other third-party service providers) and customers may be forced to cease activities. The U.S. federal government, through both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ), has the right to actively investigate, audit and shut-down cannabis growing facilities and retailers. The U.S. federal government may also attempt to seize our property. Any action taken by the DEA and/or the IRS to interfere with, seize, or shut down our operations will have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Some of our planned business activities, while compliant with applicable U.S. state and local law, are illegal under U.S. federal law. 
 
 Because the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal under U.S. federal law, and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under any and all circumstances under the CSA, an investor s contribution to and involvement in such activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment. We may also be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the contracts we have entered into and the products that we intend to provide. As a result, U.S. law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia, may seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, aiding and abetting another s criminal activities. The U.S. federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal. As a result of such an action, we may be forced to cease operations and be restricted from operating in the U.S., and our investors could lose their entire investment. Such an action would have a material negative effect on our business and operations. 
 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. 
 
 In addition, companies providing goods and/or services to companies like us that are engaged in cannabis-related activities may, under threat of federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, suspend or withdraw their services. Any suspension of service and inability to procure goods or services from an alternative source, even on a temporary basis, that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There is uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government and Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and their influence and policies in opposition to the cannabis industry as a whole, and their actions could result in significant fines penalties, convictions or criminal charges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis business in the United States are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation. The response to this inconsistency was addressed in the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum was addressed to all United States district attorneys acknowledging that notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a controlled substance at the federal level in the United States, several U.S. states have enacted laws relating to cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memorandum outlined certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. In particular, the Cole Memorandum noted that in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. Notably, however, the DOJ has never provided specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems it deems sufficient under the Cole Memorandum standard. 
 
 In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. States where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterized as a high priority. On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. district attorneys which rescinded the Cole Memorandum. With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, U.S. federal prosecutors can exercise their discretion in determining whether to prosecute compliant state law cannabis-related operations as violations of U.S. federal law throughout the United States. The potential impact of the decision to rescind the Cole Memorandum is unknown and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Through September 30, 2021, DOJ appropriations prohibit use of funds for enforcement actions against medical cannabis. Merrick B. Garland was sworn in on March 11, 2021 as the 86th U.S. Attorney General, and it remains unknown what position he or President Biden s administration will take regarding federal enforcement actions against the cannabis industry. 
 
 With the repeal of the Cole Memorandum by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice could allege that we and our Board and, potentially our shareholders, aided and abetted violations of federal law by providing finances and services to our portfolio cannabis companies. Under these circumstances, it is possible that the federal prosecutor would seek to seize our assets and to recover the illicit profits previously distributed to shareholders resulting from any of the foregoing financing or services. In these circumstances, our operations would cease, shareholders may lose their entire investment and our directors, officers and/or shareholders may be left to defend any criminal charges against them at their own expense and, if convicted, be sent to federal prison. 
 
 Violations of any federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on us, including our reputation and ability to conduct business, our holding (directly or indirectly) of cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of our securities on stock exchanges, our financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of our publicly traded Common Shares. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. 
 
 Our business interests in the United States include the cultivation and provision of cannabis and cannabis-infused products. We are not aware of any non-compliance with the applicable licensing requirements or regulatory framework enacted by the states in which any of our customers or partners are operating. 
 
 The industry in which we operate is still developing and subject to extensive regulation. 
 
 The cannabis industry is a new industry that may not succeed. Should the federal government in the U.S. change course and decide to prosecute those dealing in medical or other cannabis under applicable law, there may not be any market for our products and services in the U.S. Cannabis is a new industry subject to extensive regulation, and there can be no assurance that it will grow, flourish or continue to the extent necessary to permit us to succeed. We are treating the cannabis industry as a deregulating industry with significant unsatisfied demand for our proposed products and will adjust our future operations, product mix and market strategy as the industry develops and matures. Further, few clinical trials on the benefits of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids have been conducted. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to statements contained in the articles, reports and studies currently favored, or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing or other facts and perceptions related to medical cannabis, which could adversely affect social acceptance of cannabis and the demand for our products and dispensary services.

Accordingly, there is no assurance that the cannabis industry and the market for medicinal and/or adult-use cannabis will continue to exist and grow as currently anticipated or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management s expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that adversely affects the cannabis industry, such as the imposition of further restrictions on sales and marketing or further restrictions on sales in certain areas and markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We face risks due to industry immaturity or limited comparable, competitive or established industry best practices. 
 
 As a relatively new industry, there are not many established operators in the medical and adult use cannabis industries whose business models we can follow or build upon. Similarly, there is no or limited information about comparable companies available for potential investors to review in making a decision about whether to invest in us. 
 
 Shareholders and investors should consider, among other factors, our prospects for success in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies, like us, that are in their early stages. For example, unanticipated expenses and problems or technical difficulties may occur, which may result in material delays in the operation of our business. We may fail to successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of the Common Shares to the extent that investors may lose their entire investments. 
 
 The size of our target market is difficult to quantify and investors will be reliant on their own estimates on the accuracy of market data . 
 
 Because the cannabis industry is in an early stage with uncertain boundaries, there is a lack of information about comparable companies available for potential investors to review in deciding about whether to invest in us and, few, if any, established companies whose business model we can follow or upon whose success we can build. Accordingly, investors will have to rely on their own estimates in deciding about whether to invest in us. There can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate or that the market size is sufficiently large for our business to grow as projected, which may negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 Our sales and marketing activities and enforcement of contracts may be hindered by regulatory restrictions. 
 
 The development of our business and operating results may be hindered by applicable restrictions on sales and marketing activities imposed by government regulatory bodies. The regulatory environment in the United States limits our ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If we are unable to effectively market our products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for our products, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because our contracts involve cannabis and other activities that are not legal under U.S. federal law and in some jurisdictions, we may face difficulties in enforcing our contracts in U.S. federal and certain state courts. 
 
 We expect to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to our investment in infrastructure, growth, regulatory compliance and operations, and uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory status and changes may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We expect to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to our investment in infrastructure and growth and for regulatory compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to our operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than management expects, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of the Common Shares may significantly decrease . 
 
 Achievement of our business objectives is also contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and obtaining other required regulatory approvals. The regulatory regime applicable to the cannabis industry in Canada and the United States is currently undergoing significant proposed changes and we cannot predict the impact of the regime on our business once the structure of the regime is finalized. Similarly, we cannot predict the timeline required to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for our products, or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. Any delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, required regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of our markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or in restrictions on our operations.

Our investors, directors, officers and employees may be subject to entry bans into the United States. 
 
 Because cannabis remains illegal under United States federal law, those employed at or investing in legal and licensed Canadian cannabis companies could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with cannabis businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the United States could also be reason enough for United States border guards to deny entry. 
 
 On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances, and because cannabis continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to cannabis in the United States or Canada, like us, who are not United States citizens face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States for life. As described above, on October 9, 2018, CBP released an additional statement regarding the admissibility of Canadian citizens working in the legal cannabis industry. CBP stated that a Canadian citizen working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal cannabis industry in Canada coming into the United States for reasons unrelated to the cannabis industry will generally be admissible to the United States however, if such person is found to be coming into the United States for reasons related to the cannabis industry, such person may be deemed inadmissible. Any entry bans against our investors, directors, officers and employees may have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our operations may become the subject of heightened scrutiny, which may lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on our operations. 
 
 Currently, our Common Shares trade on the CSE and are quoted on the OTCQX in the United States. Our business, operations and investments in the United States, and any future business, operations or investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada and the United States. As a result, we may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on our ability to operate or invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction, in addition to those described herein. 
 
 It had been reported in Canada that the Canadian Depository for Securities Limited is considering a policy shift that would see its subsidiary, CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. CDS ), refuse to settle trades for cannabis issuers that have investments in the United States. CDS is Canada s central securities depository, clearing and settling trades in the Canadian equity, fixed income and money markets. 
 
 On February 8, 2018, following discussions with the Canadian Securities Administrators and recognized Canadian securities exchanges, the TMX Group announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the TSX Venture Exchange. The MOU outlines the parties understanding of Canada s regulatory framework applicable to the rules, procedures, and regulatory oversight of the exchanges and CDS as it relates to issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States. The MOU confirms, with respect to the clearing of listed securities, that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers. As a result, there is no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States. However, there can be no guarantee that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented at a time when the Common Shares are listed on a stock exchange, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of the Common Shares to make and settle trades. In particular, the Common Shares would become highly illiquid until an alternative was implemented, investors would have no ability to effect a trade of the Common Shares through the facilities of the applicable stock exchange. 
 
 Regulatory scrutiny of the industry in which we operate may negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital. 
 
 Our business activities rely on newly established and developing laws and regulations in the states in which we operate or intend to operate. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes, including changes in the interpretation and/or administration of applicable regulatory requirements may adversely affect our profitability or cause us to cease operations entirely. Any determination that our business fails to comply with applicable cannabis regulations would require us either to significantly change or terminate our business activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

The cannabis industry may come under the scrutiny or further scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, the DOJ, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory or other federal, state or nongovernmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale or use of cannabis for medical or nonmedical purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any proposals will become law. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding our industry may adversely affect the business and our operations, including, without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of our ability to raise additional capital, which could reduce, delay or eliminate any return on investment in us. 
 
 Due to the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, banks and other financial institutions which service the cannabis industry are at risk of violating certain financial laws, including anti-money laundering statutes. 
 
 Because the manufacture, distribution, and dispensation of cannabis remains illegal under the CSA, banks and other financial institutions providing services to cannabis-related businesses risk violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money-remitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act. These statutes can impose criminal liability for engaging in certain financial and monetary transactions with the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity such as distributing controlled substances which are illegal under federal law, including cannabis, and for failing to identify or report financial transactions that involve the proceeds of cannabis-related violations of the CSA. In the event that any of our investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investments in the United States are found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This finding could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. 
 
 Furthermore, while we have no current intention to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, in the event that a determination is made that any such investments in the United States could reasonably be shown to constitute proceeds of crime, we may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time. 
 
 The re-classification of cannabis or changes in U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 If cannabis is re-classified as a Schedule II or lower controlled substance under the CSA, the ability to conduct research on the medical benefits of cannabis would most likely be more accessible however, if cannabis is re-categorized as a Schedule II or lower controlled substance, the resulting re-classification would result in the need for approval by the FDA if medical claims are made about our medical cannabis products. As a result of such a re-classification, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and use of such products could become subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. In that case, we may be required to be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the manufacturing or distribution of our products. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. 
 
 We, and/or contract counterparties that are directly engaged in the trafficking of cannabis, may incur significant tax liabilities due to limitations on tax deductions and credits under section 280E of the Code. 
 
 Section 280E of the Code prohibits businesses from taking deductions or credits in carrying on any trade or business consisting of trafficking in certain controlled substances that are prohibited by federal law. The IRS has invoked Section 280E in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are authorized under state laws, seeking substantial sums in tax liabilities, interest and penalties resulting from underpayment of taxes due to the application of Section 280E. Under a number of cases, the United States Supreme Court has held that income means gross income (not gross receipts). Under this reasoning, the cost of goods sold COGS is permitted as a reduction in determining gross income, notwithstanding Section 280E. Although proper reductions for COGS are generally allowed to determine gross income, the scope of such items has been the subject of debate, and deductions for significant costs may not be permitted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E favorable to cannabis businesses. Thus, we, to the extent of our trafficking activities, and/or key contract counterparties directly engaged in trafficking in cannabis, have incurred significant tax liabilities from the application of Section 280E. Our income tax obligations under Section 280E of the Code are typically substantially higher as compared to companies to which Section 280E does not apply. Section 280E essentially requires us to pay federal, and as applicable, state income taxes on gross profit, which presents a significant financial burden that increases our net loss and may make it more difficult for us to generate net profit and cash flow from operations in future periods. In addition, to the extent that the application of Section 280E creates a financial burden on contract counterparties, such burdens may impact the ability of such counterparties to make full or timely payment to us, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business.

State and local laws and regulations may heavily regulate brands and forms of cannabis products, and there is no guarantee that our proposed products and brands will be approved for sale and distribution in any state. 
 
 States generally only allow the manufacture, sale and distribution of cannabis products that are grown in that state and may require advance approval of such products. Certain states and local jurisdictions have promulgated certain requirements for approved cannabis products based on the form of the product and the concentration of the various cannabinoids in the product. While we intend to follow the guidelines and regulations of each applicable state and local jurisdiction in preparing products for sale and distribution, there is no guarantee that such products will be approved to the extent necessary. If the products are approved, there is a risk that any state or local jurisdiction may revoke its approval for such products based on changes in laws or regulations or based on its discretion or otherwise. As we expand into other U.S. jurisdictions, we plan to undertake no cross-border cannabis commerce between states until the federal regulatory environment permits such commerce to occur. 
 
 We may have difficulty accessing the service of banks and processing credit card payments in the future, which may make it difficult for us to operate. 
 
 In February 2014, the FinCEN issued guidance (which is not law) with respect to financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses, including burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. This guidance does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the DOJ, FinCEN or other federal regulators. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions do not appear to be comfortable providing banking services to cannabis-related businesses, or relying on this guidance, which can be amended or revoked at any time by the Biden administration. In addition to the foregoing, banks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, we may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States and may have to operate our business on an all-cash basis. The inability or limitation in our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions. 
 
 Our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors (or the equivalent thereof) and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Government approvals and permits are currently, and may in the future, be required in connection with our operations. To the extent such approvals are required and not obtained, we may be curtailed or prohibited from our current or proposed production, manufacturing or sale of marijuana or marijuana products or from proceeding with the development of our operations as currently proposed. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. We may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of its operations and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. 
 
 Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing the production, manufacturing or sale of marijuana or marijuana products, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on us and cause increases in expenses, capital expenditures or production or manufacturing costs or reduction in levels of production, manufacturing or sale or require abandonment or delays in development. 
 
 Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations, or may only be able to do so at great cost, to operate our businesses. In addition, we may not be able to comply fully with the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to the cannabis industry. Failure to comply with or to obtain the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations could result in restrictions on our ability to operate in the cannabis industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

If obtained, any state licenses in the U.S. are expected to be subject to ongoing compliance and reporting requirements. In certain states, such as Nevada, regulators have the ability to impose a background check, a requirement which may or may not be waivable at the discretion of the regulator, on any individual holding an ownership interest in the licenses, with failure to provide such background check potentially resulting penalties including civil fines and penalties up to suspension or revocation of the underlying license(s). A state regulator may or may not act upon a waiver request, and receipt of an approved waiver request does not preclude a state regulator from revisiting the determination and requiring a background check be conducted on any shareholder. In addition, under Nevada cannabis laws, any beneficial holder of any of our securities, regardless of the number of shares, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the CCB has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. 
 
 State-license applications or state-regulator license award announcements, including state-run license lotteries, may not result in issuance of a license to us, conditional or otherwise. 
 
 Additionally, conditional licenses we hold or we may receive may not pass final inspections or requirements imposed by regulators, and would expire. Should any state in which a license is necessary to operate our business, extend or renew such license or should it renew such license on different terms, or should it decide to grant more than the anticipated number of licenses, our business, financial condition and results of the operation could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 U.S. state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis could be repealed or overturned, and local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. 
 
 There is no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce U.S. federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing state laws are repealed or curtailed, our business or operations in those states or under those laws would be materially and adversely affected. Federal actions against any individual or entity engaged in the cannabis industry or a substantial repeal of cannabis related legislation could adversely affect us, our business and our assets or investments. 
 
 The rulemaking process at the state level that applies to cannabis operators in any state will be ongoing and result in frequent changes. As a result, a compliance program is essential to manage regulatory risk. All operating policies and procedures we have implemented are compliance-based and are derived from the state regulatory structure governing ancillary cannabis businesses and their relationships to state-licensed or permitted cannabis operators, if any. Notwithstanding our efforts and diligence, regulatory compliance and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals can be costly and time-consuming. No assurance can be given that we will receive the requisite licenses, permits or cards to continue operating our businesses. 
 
 In addition, local laws and ordinances could restrict our business activity. Although our operations are legal under the laws of the states in which our business operates, local governments have the ability to limit, restrict and ban cannabis businesses from operating within their jurisdiction. Land use, zoning, local ordinances and similar laws could be adopted or changed and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Multiple states where medical and/or adult use cannabis is legal have or are considering special taxes or fees on businesses in the cannabis industry. It is uncertain at this time whether other states are in the process of reviewing such additional taxes and fees. The implementation of special taxes or fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 We may face limitations on ownership of cannabis licenses, which may restrict our ability to grow. 
 
 In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person or entity may own. Such limitations on the ownership of additional licenses within certain states may limit our ability to grow in such states. We employ joint ventures from time to time to ensure continued compliance with the applicable regulatory guidelines. Currently, we have a joint venture with a third party in Illinois. We intend to structure our joint ventures on a case-by-case basis but generally intend to maintain operational control over the joint venture business and a variable economic interest through the applicable governing documents.

We may become subject to FDA or ATF regulation that may have an adverse effect on our business, and we may be subject to negative clinical trials. 
 
 Cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance under U.S. federal law. If the federal government reclassifies cannabis to a Schedule II controlled substance, it is possible that the FDA would seek to regulate cannabis under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations, including good manufacturing practices, related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical cannabis. Clinical trials may be needed to verify the efficacy and safety of cannabis. It is also possible that the FDA would require facilities where medical use cannabis is grown to register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, the impact they would have on the cannabis industry is unknown, including the costs, requirements and possible prohibitions that may be enforced. If we are unable to comply with the potential regulations or registration requirements prescribed by the FDA, it may have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 It is also possible that the federal government could seek to regulate cannabis under the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the ATF ). The ATF may issue rules and regulations related to the use, transporting, sale and advertising of cannabis or cannabis products, including smokeless cannabis products. 
 
 From time to time, studies or clinical trials on cannabis products may be conducted by academics or others, including government agencies. The publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials related to our proposed products or the therapeutic areas in which our proposed products will compete could have a material adverse effect on our sales. 
 
 Some of our planned business activities are contingent upon the enactment of adoption of new regulations in the State of Nevada. 
 
 Our objective is to build out a portion of the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore for use as an on-site cannabis consumption lounge as part of its phased expansion plans. We are in the process of converting our prospective consumption lounge license to conditional status after which we will be subject to final approval from CCB before becoming operational. There is no guarantee that the CCB will grant us the final license. Should we not be awarded the necessary license, we may be unable to position the reserved space at the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore to its highest and best intended use. 
 
 We could be subject to criminal prosecution or civil liabilities under RICO. 
 
 The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act RICO criminalizes the use of any profits from certain defined racketeering activities in interstate commerce. While intended to provide an additional cause of action against organized crime, due to the fact that cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law, the production and sale of cannabis qualifies cannabis related businesses as racketeering as defined by RICO. As such, all officers, managers and owners in a cannabis related business could be subject to criminal prosecution under RICO, which carries substantial criminal penalties. 
 
 RICO can create civil liability as well: persons harmed in their business or property by actions which would constitute racketeering under RICO often have a civil cause of action against such racketeers, and can claim triple their amount of estimated damages in attendant court proceedings. We, as well as our officers, managers and owners, could all be subject to civil claims under RICO. 
 
 We lack access to U.S. bankruptcy protections. 
 
 Many courts have denied cannabis businesses bankruptcy protections because the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law. In the event of a company s bankruptcy, it may be very difficult for lenders to recoup their investments in the cannabis industry. If we experience a bankruptcy, there is no guarantee that U.S. federal bankruptcy protections would be available, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We are subject to various SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. We have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of our management s time in our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing we conduct in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of the Common Shares.

Risks Related to our Business and Operations 
 
 The full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown at this time, and it may cause a significant negative effect on us in the future. 
 
 We caution that current global uncertainty with respect to the spread of COVID-19 or its variants and its effect on the broader global economy may have a significant negative effect on us. While the continued impact of COVID-19 on us remains unknown, continued spread of COVID-19 or its variants may have a material adverse effect on global economic activity and can, and in some cases, has resulted in volatility and disruption to global supply chains, operations, mobility of people and the financial markets, which could and may continue to affect interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business, financial conditions, results of operations and other factors relevant to us. Long-term economic impacts relating to COVID-19 and state and national fiscal policy related to combatting the economic impacts of COVID-19 may have a long-term detrimental impact on customer spending, costs of customer acquisition, and may be a driver for rapid inflation which could negatively affect our customers discretionary spending capability or increase our materials and labor costs in future periods. 
 
 We face increasing competition that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The cannabis industry and businesses ancillary to and directly involved with cannabis businesses are undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and formation of strategic relationships. As such, we face competition from companies that may have greater capitalization, access to public equity markets, more experienced management or more maturity as a business. The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in the cannabis market consist of localized businesses (those doing business in a single state), although there are multistate operators with which we compete directly. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter markets through acquisitive growth are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute our growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. We are likely to continue to face increasing and intense competition from these companies. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If the number of users of adult-use and medical marijuana in the United States increases, the demand for products will increase. Consequently, we expect that competition will become more intense as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products to respond to such increased demand. To remain competitive, we will require a continued investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain sufficient levels of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts to remain competitive, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions in the cannabis industry could harm us in a number of ways, including losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing us to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm our operating results. As competitors enter the market and become increasingly sophisticated, competition in our industry may intensify and place downward pressure on retail prices for our products and services, which could negatively impact our profitability. 
 
 Our reliance on our operations in limited jurisdictions means that adverse changes or developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 To date, our activities and resources have been primarily focused within the States of Nevada and California, and we have acquired or announced award of licenses in the States of Florida and Illinois in 2021. We expect to continue the focus on these states as we continue to review further expansion opportunities into other jurisdictions in the United States. Adverse changes or developments within California, Florida, Illinois, or Nevada could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue producing cannabis, and our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 Our probable lack of business diversification could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Because we are initially focused solely on developing our cannabis business, the prospects for our success will depend upon the future performance and market acceptance of our intended facilities, products, processes, and services. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to develop and explore numerous product lines, operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, we do not anticipate the ability to immediately diversify or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses.

There is no assurance that we will be profitable or pay dividends. 
 
 There is no assurance as to whether we will achieve profitability or pay dividends. We have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses relating to the development and initial operations of our business. The payment and amount of any future dividends, if any, will depend upon, among other things, our results of operations, cash flow, financial condition, and operating and capital requirements. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividends. In the event that any of our investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investments in the United States were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. 
 
 Increased prices and inflation could negatively impact our margin performance and our financial results. 
 
 Increased inflation, including rising prices for raw materials and components, labor and energy increases, the costs to manufacture and distribute our products, and we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers. Additionally, we are exposed to fluctuations in other costs such as labor and energy prices. If inflation in these costs increases beyond our ability to control for them through measures such as implementing operating efficiencies, we may not be able to increase prices to sufficiently offset the effect of various cost increases without negatively impacting customer demand, thereby negatively impacting our margin performance and results of operations. 
 
 We are a developing company and have only recently begun to generate positive cash flow. 
 
 We have only recently begun to generate positive cash flow and opened the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore on November 1, 2018, and the Planet 13 OC Superstore on July 1, 2021. It is extremely difficult to make accurate predictions and forecasts of our finances. This is compounded by the fact that we operate in the cannabis industry, which is rapidly transforming. There is no guarantee that our products or services will continue to be attractive to current and potential consumers. 
 
 Our business is exposed to risks inherent in an agricultural business, which may have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our business involves the growing of cannabis, an agricultural product. As such, there are many similar risks as with any agricultural commodity, such as fluctuations in pricing. We will be subject to other risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as insects, plant diseases, drought, and similar cultivation risks. Although we expect that any such growing will be completed under climate-controlled conditions, there can be no assurance that natural elements will not have a material adverse effect on any such future production. 
 
 We are dependent on the popularity of consumer acceptance of our brand portfolio to generate revenues. 
 
 Our ability to generate revenue and be successful in the implementation of our business plan is dependent on consumer acceptance of and demand for our products. Acceptance of our products depends on several factors, including availability, cost, ease of use, familiarity of use, convenience, effectiveness, consistency of product quality and reliability. If these customers do not accept our products, or if such products fail to adequately meet customers needs and expectations, our ability to continue generating revenues could be reduced. 
 
 We may be adversely impacted by rising or volatile energy costs. 
 
 Our cannabis growing operations consume considerable energy, which makes us vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs may adversely affect our business and our ability to operate profitably. 
 
 We may encounter unknown environmental risks that may delay the development of our businesses . 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will not encounter hazardous conditions, such as asbestos or lead, at the sites of the real estate used to operate our businesses, which may delay the development of our businesses. Upon encountering a hazardous condition, work at our facilities may be suspended. If we receive notice of a hazardous condition, we may be required to correct the condition prior to continuing construction. If additional hazardous conditions were present, it would likely delay construction and may require significant expenditure of our resources to correct the conditions. Such conditions could have a material impact on our investment returns.

Threats to our information technology systems and potential cyber-attacks and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition . 
 
 Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our suppliers protect networks, equipment, information technology IT systems and software against damage and threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance and replacement of network equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate associated risks. Given the nature of our products and the lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the federal government, as well as the concentration of inventory in our facilities, there remains a risk of shrinkage, as well as theft. A security breach at one of our facilities could expose us to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential consumers from choosing our products. If there were a breach in security and we fell victim to theft or robbery, the loss of cannabis plants, cannabis oils, cannabis flowers and cultivations and processing equipment, or if there were a failure in information systems, it could adversely affect our reputation and business continuity. 
 
 Additionally, we may store and collect personal information about customers and are responsible for protecting that information from privacy breaches that may occur through procedural or process failure, IT malfunction or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Theft of data for competitive purposes, particularly consumer lists and preferences, is an ongoing risk whether perpetrated via employee collusion or negligence or through deliberate cyber-attack. Any such theft or privacy breach would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 We have not experienced any material losses to date relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not incur such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. 
 
 We are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA )) and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of personal data. Our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify regulators and customers, employees and other individuals of a data security breach. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the CCPA and the privacy laws, rules and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. In addition, non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities and/or significant fines, could negatively impact our reputation and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards for which we may not be able to obtain any or adequate insurance coverage. 
 
 Our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental conditions, accidents, labor disputes and changes in the regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to assets, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in operations, monetary losses and possible legal liability. 
 
 Although we intend to continue to maintain insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as we consider to be reasonable, our insurance will not cover all the potential risks associated with our operations. We may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards encountered in our operations is not generally available on acceptable terms. We might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we may not be insured against or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.

Our business faces risks of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action, complaints, enforcement action and litigation that could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our potential products and have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 As a distributor of products designed to be ingested by humans, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. In addition, the sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of our products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products caused injury, illness or death, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs, could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and consumers generally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our potential products. 
 
 In general, our participation in the cannabis industry may lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints, enforcement actions, and inquiries by various federal, state, or local governmental authorities against us. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these actions may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could result in material liability or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions involving either us and/or our subsidiaries, regardless of the outcome, could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, adversely impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Shares and our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We or our subsidiaries may also be party to litigation or subject to claims from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Monitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, can be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these actions may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could result in material liability or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. Litigation, complaints, and actions involving either us and/or our subsidiaries, regardless of the outcome, could consume considerable amounts of financial and other corporate resources, adversely impact our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Shares and our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Product recalls could lead to decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Manufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labelling disclosure. If any of our products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although we have detailed procedures in place for testing our products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of our brands were subject to recall, the image of that brand and of us could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. 
 
 Our research and development activities may not prove profitable, and we may not be able to accurately forecast our operating results and plan our operations due to uncertainties in the cannabis industry. 
 
 Although we are committed to researching and developing new markets and products and improving existing products, there can be no assurances that such research and market development activities will prove profitable or that the resulting markets and/or products, if any, will be commercially viable or successfully produced and marketed.

We are operating our business in a relatively new medical and adult-use cannabis industry and market. We must rely largely on our own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the medical and adult-use cannabis industry in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, or Nevada. Further, because U.S. federal and state laws prevent widespread participation in and otherwise hinder market research in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry as a whole, the third-party market data available to us is limited and unreliable. Our market research and projections of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research, are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data, and generally represent the personal opinions of our management team. Due to the early stage of the regulated cannabis industry, forecasts regarding the size of the industry and the sales of products by us are inherently difficult to prepare with a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Any event or circumstance that affects the recreational or medical cannabis industry or market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurances can be given that this industry and market will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management s expectations and assumptions. A failure in the demand for products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We rely on our executive officers, our key research and development personnel and our key growth and extraction personnel for our future success, and if any such persons were unable to continue in their present positions, we might not be able to replace them. 
 
 Our success has depended, and continues to depend, upon our ability to attract and retain key management, including our Co-CEOs, Chief Financial Officer, Vice-President of Finance, Vice-President of Operations, Vice-President of Sales and Marketing, General Counsel and technical experts. We will attempt to enhance our management and technical expertise by continuing to recruit qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas. Our inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees or engineering and technical support resources could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, sales, cash flow or financial condition. Shortages in qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations of the business and could limit our ability to develop and market our cannabis-related products. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. 
 
 Our future success depends substantially on the continued services of our executive officers, our key research and development personnel and our key growth and extraction personnel. If one or more of our executive officers or key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we might not be able to replace them easily or at all. In addition, if any of our executive officers or key employees join a competitor or form a competing company, we may lose know-how, key professionals and staff members. These executive officers and key employees could compete with and take customers away. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. 
 
 We could be liable for fraudulent or illegal activity by our employees, contractors and consultants resulting in significant financial losses and claims against us. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate government regulations. It is not always possible for us to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In certain circumstances, our reputation could be damaged, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business. 
 
 Damage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events and could include any negative publicity, whether true or not. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easy for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views regarding us and our activities, whether true or not. Although we believe that we operate in a manner that is respectful to all stakeholders and that we take care in protecting our image and reputation, we do not ultimately have direct control over how we are perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to our overall ability to advance our projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on our financial performance, financial condition, cash flows and growth prospects.

Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception could lead to a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 We believe the medical and recreational cannabis industries are highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis distributed to such consumers. Consumer perception of our products may be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of cannabis or derivative products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical or recreational cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our dependence on consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for our products, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of cannabis in general, or our products specifically, or associating the consumption of cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. Public opinion and support for medical and recreational cannabis has traditionally been inconsistent and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. While public opinion and support appears to be rising for legalizing medical and adult-use cannabis, it remains a controversial issue subject to differing opinions surrounding the level of legalization (for example, medical cannabis as opposed to legalization in general). 
 
 Because of our reliance on key inputs and their related costs, any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of our supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 The cultivation, extraction and processing of cannabis and derivative products is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs, including raw materials, electricity, water and other local utilities. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier were to go out of business, the relevant investment entity might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to secure required supplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Our ability to compete and grow will also be dependent on having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in maintaining our required supply of equipment, parts and components. This could have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 
 We are a holding company and are dependent on the earnings and distributions by our subsidiary, MMDC. 
 
 We are a holding company and the vast majority of our assets are the capital stock of MMDC. As a result, our investors are subject to the risks attributable to MMDC. As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our business through MMDC, which generates substantially all of our revenues. Consequently, our cash flows and ability to complete current or desirable future enhancement opportunities are dependent on the earnings of MMDC and the distribution of those earnings to us. The ability of MMDC to pay dividends and other distributions will depend on its operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and regulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by MMDC and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing its debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of MMDC, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors may be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of MMDC before us. 
 
 The termination of any of our leases may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 
 We currently lease our production and cultivation facility, the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, the Medizin dispensary in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Planet 13 OC Superstore. Each of the leases specifically contemplates carrying on licensed cannabis activities pursued by us and through our subsidiaries at those locations. While we currently have a good relationship with each of our landlords, a termination of any of the leases by any of our respective landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.

Competition for the acquisition and leasing of properties suitable for the cultivation, production and sale of medical and adult use cannabis may impede our ability to make acquisitions or increase the cost of these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 We compete for the acquisition of properties suitable for the cultivation, production and sale of medical and adult use cannabis with entities engaged in agriculture and real estate investment activities, including corporate agriculture companies, cultivators, producers and sellers of cannabis. These competitors may prevent us from acquiring and leasing desirable properties, may cause an increase in the price we must pay for properties or may result in us having to lease our properties on less favorable terms than we expect. Our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do and may be willing to pay more for certain assets or may be willing to accept more risk than we believe can be prudently managed. In particular, larger companies may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Our competitors may also adopt transaction structures similar to ours, which would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms. In addition, due to a number of factors, including but not limited to potential greater clarity of the laws and regulations governing medical use cannabis by state and federal governments, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase, resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these properties. If we pay higher prices for properties or enter into leases for such properties on less favorable terms than we expect, our profitability and ability to generate cash flow and make distributions to our stockholders may decrease. Increased competition for properties may also preclude us from acquiring those properties that would generate attractive returns to us. 
 
 We face costs of maintaining a public listing and reporting requirements which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 As a public company with securities listed on the CSE, there are costs associated with legal, accounting and other expenses related to regulatory compliance. Securities legislation and the rules and policies of the CSE require listed companies to, among other things, adopt corporate governance and related practices, and to continuously prepare and disclose material information, all of which add to a company s legal and financial compliance costs. We may also elect to devote greater resources than we otherwise would have on communication and other activities typically considered important by publicly traded companies. 
 
 In addition we are subject to the reporting requirements, rules and regulations under applicable Canadian and U.S. securities laws. The requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Currency fluctuations could expose us to exchange risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Our revenues and expenses are expected to be primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, while funding may occur in Canadian dollars or other non-U.S. currencies, therefore exposing us to currency exchange fluctuations. Recent events in the global financial markets have been coupled with increased volatility in the currency markets. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We may, in the future, establish a program to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure with the objective of minimizing the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange movements. However, even if we develop a hedging program, there can be no assurance that it will effectively mitigate currency risks. 
 
 We may face difficulties acquiring additional financing to fund our growth, and we can provide no guarantee on the use of available funds. 
 
 The development of our business and our ability to execute on expansion opportunities will depend, in part, upon the amount of additional financing available. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in delaying, scaling back, eliminating or indefinitely postponing our expansion opportunities and our current or future operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be acceptable. In addition, there can be no assurance that future financing can be obtained without substantial dilution to existing shareholders. Our inability to raise financing through traditional banking or other channels to fund ongoing operations, capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit our growth and may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenue, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 We expect to continue to have access to equity and debt financing from the public and prospectus exempt (private placement) markets in Canada. If such equity and/or debt financing is no longer available in the public markets in Canada due to changes in applicable law, then we expect that we would have access to raise equity and/or debt financing privately. However, we can provide no assurances that access to such sources of capital will be available in the future.

Commercial banks, private equity firms and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or on terms that are acceptable, particularly if the U.S. federal authorities change their position toward enforcing the CSA. Further, access to funding from U.S. residents may be limited due their unwillingness to be associated with activities which violate U.S. federal laws. Any inability by us to raise financing, if, as, or when required, to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit our growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. 
 
 Further, we cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of our available funds. Management has broad discretion in the application of our available funds. Accordingly, shareholders of the Common Shares will have to rely upon the judgment of management with respect to the use of available funds, with only limited information concerning management s specific intentions. Our management may spend a portion or all of the available funds in ways that our shareholders might not desire, that might not yield a favorable return and that might not increase the value of a shareholder s investment. The failure by management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending use of such funds, we might invest available funds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. 
 
 Our officers and directors may be engaged in a range of business activities resulting in conflicts of interest. 
 
 Although certain of our officers are bound by non-competition agreements limiting their ability to enter into competing and/or conflicting ventures or businesses during, and for a period of 12 months after, their employment with us, we may be subject to various potential conflicts of interest because some of our officers and directors may be engaged in a range of business activities. In addition, our executive officers and directors may devote time to their outside business interests, so long as such activities do not materially or adversely interfere with their duties to us. In some cases, our executive officers and directors may have fiduciary obligations associated with these business interests that interfere with their ability to devote time to our business and affairs and that could adversely affect our operations. These business interests could require significant time and attention of our executive officers and directors. 
 
 In addition, we may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of our directors and the officers who may from time to time deal with persons, firms, institutions or companies with which we may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those desired by us. The interests of these persons could conflict with ours. In addition, from time to time, these persons may be competing with us for available investment opportunities. Conflicts of interest, if any, will be subject to the procedures and remedies provided under applicable laws. In particular, if such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or against the approval of such participation or such terms. In accordance with applicable laws, our directors are required to act honestly, in good faith and in our best interests. 
 
 Our actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from the expectations of management. 
 
 Our actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from management s expectations. As a result, our revenue, net income and cash flow may differ materially from our projected revenue, net income and cash flow. The process for estimating our revenue, net income and cash flow requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates and assumptions may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used in planning may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow may be negatively impacted by challenging global economic conditions. 
 
 Disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and declining consumer and business confidence, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to decreased levels of consumer spending. Our operations could be affected by the economic context should the unemployment level, interest rates or inflation reach levels that influence consumer spending and, consequently, impact our sales and profitability. These macroeconomic developments could negatively impact our business, which depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our existing customers or attract new customers, or we may be forced to reduce the price of our products. We are unable to predict the likelihood of the occurrence, duration, or severity of such disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. Any general or market-specific economic downturn could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cashflow.

Risks Related to our Acquisitions and Growth Strategy 
 
 Our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including NGW, their products and other assets, or if integrated, failure to further our business strategy, may result in our inability to realize any benefit from such acquisition. 
 
 We may grow by acquiring other businesses. For example, on March 2, 2022, we acquired NGW in the Arrangement, as previously described in this report. The consummation and integration of any acquired business, product or other assets may be complex and time consuming and, if such businesses and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Furthermore, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or other challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, technology or other asset or arrangement. If integration is not managed successfully by our management, we may experience interruptions in our business activities, deterioration in our employee, customer or other relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 If and when we acquire cannabis businesses, we may obtain the rights to applications for licenses as well as licenses however, the procurement of such applications for licenses and licenses generally will be subject to governmental and regulatory approval. There are no guarantees that we will successfully consummate such acquisitions, and even if we consummate such acquisitions, the procurement of applications for licenses may never result in the grant of a license by any state or local governmental or regulatory agency and the transfer of any rights to licenses may never be approved by the applicable state and/or local governmental or regulatory agency. 
 
 While we intend to conduct reasonable due diligence in connection with our acquisitions, there are risks inherent in any acquisition. Specifically, there could be unknown or undisclosed risks or liabilities of such entities or assets for which we are not sufficiently indemnified. Any such unknown or undisclosed risks or liabilities could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. We could encounter additional transaction and integration related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits from the acquisition. All of these factors could cause dilution to our revenue per share or decrease or delay the anticipated accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of the Common Shares. 
 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 
 If we implement our business plan as intended, we may in the future experience rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time. The management of this growth will require, among other things, continued development of our financial and management controls and management information systems, stringent control of costs, the ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training of new personnel. We intend to utilize outsourced resources and hire additional personnel to manage our expected growth and expansion. Failure to successfully manage our possible growth and development could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of the Common Shares. 
 
 There is a risk that some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits may fail to materialize, may not continue on their existing terms, or may not occur within the time period anticipated. Although we have conducted due diligence with respect to material aspects of the development of our business, there is no certainty that our due diligence procedures will reveal all of the risks and liabilities associated with our current plans. Although we are not aware of any specific liabilities, such liabilities may be unknown and, accordingly, the potential monetary cost of such liability is also unknown. 
 
 The issuance of a significant number of our Common Shares in connection with the Arrangement could adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares. 
 
 The Arrangement closed on March 2, 2022 and resulted in a significant number of additional Common Shares being issued and available for trading in the public market. The increase in the number of our Common Shares may lead to sales of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, our Common Shares. 
 
 Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
 
 We may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights. 
 
 We may be forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights. Any such litigation could be very costly and could distract management from focusing on operating our business. The existence and/or outcome of any such litigation could harm our business. Further, because the content of much of our intellectual property concerns cannabis and other activities that are not legal in some state jurisdictions or under federal law, we may face additional difficulties in defending our intellectual property rights. 

46

Table of Contents 

U.S. federal trademark and patent protection may not be available for our intellectual property due to the current classification of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, and we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights, particularly in the U.S., even if available. 
 
 Our ability to compete may depend on the superiority, uniqueness and value of any intellectual property and technology that we may develop. To the extent we are able to do so, to protect any proprietary rights, we intend to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. Despite these efforts, any of the following occurrences may reduce the value of any of our intellectual property: 
 
 The market for our products and services may depend to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, and our ability to register certain of our intellectual property under U.S. federal and state law is impaired by the illegality of cannabis under U.S. federal law 

The market for our products and services may depend to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, and our ability to register certain of our intellectual property under U.S. federal and state law is impaired by the illegality of cannabis under U.S. federal law 

Patents in the cannabis industry involve complex legal and scientific questions and patent protection may not be available for some or any products 

Our applications for trademarks and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated 

Issued patents, trademarks and registered copyrights may not provide us with competitive advantages 

Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of any of our products or intellectual property 

Our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or marketing strategies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we develop 

Another party may assert a blocking patent and we would need to either obtain a license or design around the patent in order to continue to offer the contested feature or service in our products or 

The expiration of patent or other intellectual property protections for any assets we own could result in significant competition, potentially at any time and without notice, resulting in a significant reduction in sales. 

The effect of the loss of these protections on us and our financial results will depend, among other things, upon the nature of the market and the position of our products in the market from time to time, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of manufacturing a competitive product and regulatory approval requirements, but the impact could be material and adverse. 
 
 Further, as long as cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance pursuant to the CSA, the benefit of certain federal laws and protections which may be available to most businesses, such as a federal trademark regarding the intellectual property of a business, may not be available to us. As a result, our intellectual property may never be adequately or sufficiently protected against the use or misappropriation by third parties. In addition, because the regulatory framework of the cannabis industry is in a constant state of flux, we can provide no assurance that we will ever obtain any protection of our intellectual property, whether on a federal, state or local level.

Risks Related to our Common Shares 
 
 Our Co-CEOs are able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval and may have interests that conflict with those of our other shareholders. 
 
 Robert Groesbeck and Larry Scheffler, the Co-CEOs, co-Chairmen and each a director of the Company, are promoters of the Company. As of March 23, 2023: (i) Mr. Groesbeck owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, a total of 38,818,935 Common Shares, and 562,510 restricted share units Restricted Share Units or RSUs ), representing in the aggregate approximately 17.52 of the equity of the Company on a fully diluted basis and (ii) Mr. Scheffler owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, a total of 39,470,205 Common Shares and 562,510 RSUs, representing in the aggregate approximately 17.81 of the equity of the Company on a fully diluted basis. By virtue of their status as our principal shareholders, and by each being a director and/or our executive officer, each of Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler have the power to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our articles, mergers, business combinations and the sale of substantially all of our assets, and their interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders. As a result, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other shareholders. Also, third parties could be discouraged from making a takeover bid. Further, sales by either Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler of a substantial number of Common Shares could cause the market price of the Common Shares to decline. 
 
 We are a U.S. domestic company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we and our shareholders are subject to U.S. tax law. 
 
 We are treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874(b) of the Code. As a result, we are subject to U.S. income tax on our worldwide income, and any dividends paid by us to holders of our shares not domiciled in the U.S. Non-U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a 30 rate or such lower rate as provided in an applicable treaty. We expect to continue to be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. 
 
 In addition, Section 382 of the Code contains rules that limit for U.S. federal income tax purposes the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses (and certain other tax attributes) existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under these rules, a corporation generally is treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a 50 increase in stock ownership by one or more five percent shareholders, within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, during a rolling three-year period. We do not have any net operating loss carry forwards or research and development credit carry forwards as of December 31, 2017 that would be subject to Section 382 of the Code. 
 
 Furthermore, we will be subject to Canadian income tax on our worldwide income. Consequently, it is anticipated that we may be liable for both U.S. and Canadian income tax, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Because the Common Shares are treated as shares of a U.S. domestic corporation, the U.S. gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer tax rules may apply to a Non-U.S. Holder of Common Shares. 
 
 Dividends received by Canadian holders of Common Shares are subject to U.S. withholdings tax . 
 
 Dividends received by holders of Common Shares who are residents of Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Tax Act will be subject to U.S. withholding tax. A foreign tax credit under the Tax Act in respect of such U.S. withholding taxes may not be available to such holder. 
 
 Dividends received by non-resident holders of Common Shares who are U.S. holders will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax but will be subject to Canadian withholding tax. Because we will be considered to be a U.S. domestic company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, dividends paid by us will be characterized as U.S. source income for purposes of the foreign tax credit rules under the Code.

The market price for the Common Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 The market price for the Common Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations (ii) recommendations by securities research analysts (iii) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies in the industry in which we operate (iv) addition or departure of our executive officers and other key personnel (v) release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on outstanding Common Shares (vi) sales or perceived sales of additional Common Shares (vii) significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors (viii) fluctuations to the costs of vital production materials and services (ix) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates and product price volatility (x) operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us or from a lack of market comparable companies (xi) news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry or target markets and (xii) regulatory changes in the industry. 
 
 Financial markets have at times historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the Common Shares may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which might result in impairment losses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely affected and the trading price of the Common Shares might be materially adversely affected. 
 
 It may be difficult for U.S. holders of the Common Shares to resell them over the CSE or at all. 
 
 Major securities clearing firms in the U.S. have ceased participating or may be unwilling to participate in transactions related to securities of Canadian public companies involved in the medical and adult use cannabis industry in the US. This appears to be due to the fact that cannabis continues to be listed as a controlled substance under U.S. federal law, with the result that cannabis-related practices or activities, including the cultivation, possession or distribution of cannabis, are illegal under U.S. federal law. Accordingly, U.S. residents who acquire the Common Shares as restricted securities may find it difficult to resell such shares over the facilities of any Canadian stock exchange on which the shares may then be listed including the CSE. It remains unclear what impact, if any, this and any future actions among market participants in the U.S. will have on the ability of U.S. residents to resell any of the Common Shares that they may acquire in open market transactions. 
 
 Generally, given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, capital markets participants may be unwilling to assist with the settlement of trades for U.S. resident securityholders of companies with operations in the U.S. cannabis industry, which may prohibit or significantly impair the ability of securityholders in the United States to trade our securities. If residents of the United States are unable to settle trades of our securities, this may affect the pricing of such securities in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of these securities. 
 
 Future sales of the Common Shares by existing shareholders could reduce the market price of the Common Shares. 
 
 Sales of a substantial number of the Common Shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of the Common Shares intend to sell the Common Shares, could reduce the market price of the Common Shares. Additional Common Shares may be available for sale into the public market, subject to applicable securities laws, which could reduce the market price for the Common Shares. Holders of our incentive stock options may have an immediate income inclusion for tax purposes when they exercise their options (that is, tax is not deferred until they sell the underlying Common Shares). As a result, these holders may need to sell the Common Shares purchased on the exercise of options in the same year that they exercise their options. This might result in a greater number of Common Shares being sold in the public market, and fewer long-term holds of Common Shares by our management and employees.

The lease is for a term of eleven years and six months with a base rent of US 2.00 per square foot, and includes four five-year options to renew. That lease has been subsequently amended to include Units A through H for the retail facility under construction and Units K-M for the distribution facility currently under construction, for a total of 30,001 square feet of office and warehouse space.

Shareholders 
 
 As of March 22, 2023, there were 260 holders of record of Common Shares and no holders of record of Restricted Voting Shares. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 We have not paid dividends since the completion of the Business Combination and currently intend to reinvest all future earnings to finance the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not intend to pay dividends on the Common Shares or any Restricted Voting Shares in the foreseeable future.

 COVID-19 Pandemic Update for 2022 
 
 Starting on February 10, 2022, COVID-19 protocols in Nevada no longer include mask mandates in Clark and Nye County, where we have operations, for all individuals within public indoor settings. 
 
 On March 1, 2022, the State of California changed mask requirements arising under the general industry safety order by Cal/OSHA, with a strong recommendation that masks were required statewide for unvaccinated individuals in indoor public settings and workplaces, as opposed to the previous requirement for mask use by unvaccinated individuals. 
 
 On May 3, 2021, Governor DeSantis signed an executive order stating, "all local COVID-19 restrictions and mandates on individuals and businesses are hereby ending all mask mandates in Florida from that time forward." 
 
 These policies have continued through the date of this report. 
 
 We caution that current global uncertainty with respect to the spread of COVID-19 or its variants and its effect on the broader global economy may have a significant negative effect on us. While the continued impact of COVID-19 on us remains unknown, continued spread of COVID-19 or its variants may have a material adverse effect on global economic activity and can, and in some cases, has resulted in volatility and disruption to global supply chains, operations, mobility of people and the financial markets, which could and may continue to affect interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business, financial conditions, results of operations and other factors relevant to us. Long-term economic impacts relating to COVID-19 and state and national fiscal policy related to combatting the economic impacts of COVID-19 may have a long-term detrimental impact on customer spending, costs of customer acquisition, and may be a driver for rapid inflation which could negatively affect our customers discretionary spending capability or increase our materials and labor costs in future periods. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 On March 2, 2022 (the Closing Date ), we completed our acquisition of NGW. We entered into an arrangement agreement (the Arrangement Agreement with NGW on December 20, 2021, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire (the Arrangement all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NGW (the NGW Shares pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Arrangement was approved by the holders of NGW Shares (the NGW Shareholders at a special meeting of NGW Shareholders held on February 25, 2022, and approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 1, 2022. 
 
 Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, at 12:01 a.m. (Vancouver time) (the Effective Time on the Closing Date, we acquired all of the NGW Shares for a total consideration of approximately C 71,345,747 (based on the closing price of our Common Shares (the Planet 13 Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange on March 2, 2022), and NGW then amalgamated with us. The NGW Shareholders received 0.1145 of one Planet 13 Share (the Exchange Ratio and a nominal cash payment of C 0.0001 for each NGW Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time. As a result, 21,361,002 Planet 13 Shares and 14,788 in cash were issued in exchange for the NGW Shares. In addition, the number of Planet 13 Shares issued to any person pursuant to the Arrangement was rounded down to the nearest whole Planet 13 Share, with a cash consideration paid in lieu of the issuance of such fractional Planet 13 Share of C 3.379 per share. 
 
 Based upon the Exchange Ratio, all NGW options to acquire NGW Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were also exchanged for our options that will entitle the holders to receive, upon exercise thereof, Planet 13 Shares. As a result, we issued 1,106,925 options in exchange for the NGW options.

We experienced a 12.5 decrease in net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is attributable to a reduction in the number of customers at our Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore location compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase of revenue from the Planet 13 OC Superstore and the addition of wholesale revenue from the NGW cultivation operations in California, and an increase in net wholesale revenue in Nevada. Overall, net revenue decreased by 14,919,058 during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that the potential economic downturn and increase in inflation, including the increase in the price of gasoline and the increase in interest rates, combined to reduce the disposable income of our customers during the year ended December 31, 2022, and also had an impact on the number of customers and tourists visiting the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore and our other retail locations.

Gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 45.9 compared to 55.2 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a result of increased sales incentives during the year coupled with the increase in wholesale revenue, both from our Nevada wholesale business and from the recently acquired NGW cultivation assets in California, which has an inherently lower gross margin than retail sales revenue. 
 
 The costs of internal cultivation have continued to trend down as we continue to improve our yields and cultivation efficiency across all of our cultivation facilities. In addition, margin enhancement through the creation of internally generated brands, such as TRENDI, Leaf Vine, HaHa Gummies, Dreamland Chocolate, HaHa Beverages and Medizin, continued to have a positive impact on gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2022, helping offset the lower margins received on the sale of wholesale product and sales to local customers in the State of Nevada. We anticipate that margins will trend upward as tourist customers return to Las Vegas and the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore in greater numbers and through our ability to produce our award-winning brands in California and introduce those brands into our Planet 13 OC Superstore along with the recent introduction of NGW premium flower to the Planet 13 OC Superstore. 
 
 Our premium cultivation facilities were operating near capacity during the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amount of cannabis grown during the year increased significantly when compared to the prior year due to the addition of the 35,000 square feet of cultivation capacity that was added as part of the NGW acquisition on March 2, 2022, and the September 26, 2022 initial planting in, and subsequent harvest from, our 22,000 square foot cultivation facility expansion in Nevada. The wholesale flower market in California came under pressure due to an excess supply of flower and biomass from the harvest of outdoor crops during the November 2021 to March 2022 period. Wholesale flower prices experienced significant decline during this period, impacting gross margins and revenue at our NGW cultivation facility during the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result. The supply of wholesale flower in California appears to be stabilizing and we have seen increases in both demand and the price received for premium indoor grown flower from late April through the end of December 2022. 
 
 Overall gross profit was 47,974,754 and 66,007,977 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 respectively, a decrease of 27.3 . 
 
 General and Administrative G A expenses (which includes non-cash share-based compensation expenses), decreased by 17.6 during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31 2021. The decrease in G A expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, was a result of focused cost cutting initiatives undertaken by the Company and a reduction in share-based compensation expense recorded during the year, partially offset by the addition of G A expenses from the recently acquired NGW cultivation assets in California, a full year of operations at our Planet 13 OC Superstore compared with only six months in the prior year, as well as increased expenditures related to corporate initiatives (registration of the class of our Common Shares through filing a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC and merger and acquisition related fees incurred on the closing of the NGW acquisition) that were expensed during the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Overall, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses, G A expenses as a percentage of revenue equaled 39.9 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 37.1 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in G A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, was a direct result of the addition of one time legal and other professional fees associated with the acquisition of NGW and the Company becoming a US domestic issuer upon effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement in February 2022 as well as a decrease of 12.5 in net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Non-cash, share based compensation of 7,459,267 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, decreasing from 15,576,643 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease can be attributable to the vesting schedule for both Restricted Share Units RSUs and incentive stock options that were previously granted, particularly the net 3,954,213 RSUs that were granted on April 18, 2021, that vested 1/3 on December 1, 2021, and 1/3 on December 1, 2022, and that will vest 1/3 on December 1, 2023. These amounts are non-cash, and the expense is recognized in accordance with the vesting schedule of the underlying stock options and RSUs. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional details on the assumptions used to calculate fair value as well as information regarding the vesting of the various components of the non-cash share-based compensation. 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 41.3 during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was a result of us continuing to refine our marketing efforts to optimize marketing spend on initiatives that drive increased customer traffic to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore and the Planet 13 OC Superstore and our Medizin dispensary in Nevada. 
 
 Lease expense increased by 5.2 during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, due to increases in contracted lease rates on the Company s leased properties during the year as well as a financial incentive from the landlord of the Planet 13 OC Superstore received during the period which offset increases in contractual lease rates. We are amortizing the financial incentive benefit received over the remaining life of the lease. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization increased 56.3 during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the prior year because of the recording of depreciation on the NGW cultivation facility during the year as well as depreciation from the Planet 13 OC Superstore location, both of which were not owned/open during the prior year. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated whether intangible assets and goodwill showed any indicators of impairment, and it was determined that such indicators existed. As a result of the Company s analysis, it was determined that certain of the Company s intangibles were impaired, resulting in the Company recording an impairment charge of 32,750,466. This charge is comprised of an impairment of 6,947,778 on the carrying value of our cultivation license in Coalinga California and an impairment charge of 25,802,688 reducing the carrying value of goodwill associated with our acquisition of Next Green Wave to 0. No such impairment of intangible assets was determined or recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 7 of our Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Interest income was 454,892 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to interest expense of 16,984) during the year ended December 31, 2021. The interest expense relates to accrued interest on our note payable that is due and payable on demand offset by interest income earned on cash deposits. The balance of notes payable as of December 31, 2022, was 884,000 compared to 884,000 as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 We conduct our operations in both United States dollars and Canadian dollars, holding financial assets and incurring expenses in both currencies. On December 31, 2021, the value of the USD was USD 1.00=CAD 1.3544 compared to the value of the USD of USD 1.00=CAD 1.3707 at December 31, 2022 and averaged USD 1.00=CAD 1.3011 during the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in our realizing a foreign exchange loss of 25,528 during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a foreign exchange gain of 1,662,679 during the prior year. It is our policy not to hedge our CAD exposure.

Warrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815 ), as derivative liabilities based on the specific terms of the warrant agreements. Liability-classified instruments are recorded at fair value at each reporting period with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Transaction costs allocated to warrants that are presented as a liability are expensed immediately within other expenses (income) in the statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the change in fair value of the warrants resulted in a gain of 7,177,805 compared to a gain of 7,520 during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of 509,392 on the sale-leaseback of one of our buildings in Coalinga, California. We did not enter into any sale leaseback transaction during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Other income (expense), consisting of Automated Teller Machine ATM fees, interest and other miscellaneous income/expense was income of 413,029 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to other income of 454,300 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Transaction costs related to the issuance of warrants of 0 were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to transaction costs of 256,667 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The transaction costs represent a portion of the issuance costs that were allocated to the issuance of warrants as part of the bought deal equity financing that was completed in February 2021. 
 
 The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 8,752,361 compared to 13,478,558 for the prior year. The tax expense decreased due to the decrease in taxable profitability during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We are subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), which prohibits businesses from taking deductions or credits in carrying on any trade or business consisting of trafficking in certain controlled substances that are prohibited by federal law. We, to the extent of our trafficking activities, and/or key contract counterparties directly engaged in trafficking in cannabis, have incurred significant tax liabilities from the application of Section 280E. Our income tax obligations under Section 280E of the Code are typically substantially higher as compared to companies to which Section 280E does not apply. Section 280E essentially requires us to pay federal, and as applicable, state income taxes on gross profit, which presents a significant financial burden that increases our net loss and may make it more difficult for us to generate net profit and cash flow from operations in future periods. In addition, to the extent that the application of Section 280E creates a financial burden on contract counterparties, such burdens may impact the ability of such counterparties to make full or timely payment to us, which would also have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The overall net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 48,980,300 (( 0.23) per share) compared to an overall net loss of 19,460,952 (( 0.10) per share) for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Segmented Disclosure 
 
 The Company determined that each of its locations represents an operating segment. These operating segments have been aggregated into a single reportable segment as the Company operates as a vertically integrated cannabis company with dispensary, cultivation, production and distribution operations in the State of Nevada and dispensary, cultivation and distribution operations in the State of California. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and notes payable. We have no speculative financial instruments, derivatives, forward contracts, or hedges.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 3,801,770 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used in operating activities of 379,883) for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the receipt of cash proceeds for lease incentives as well as cost saving initiatives implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 14,175,937 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 81,756,746 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily related to the acquisition of our Florida license in the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2022 acquisition of NGW was an all-stock purchase, and the cash acquired in this acquisition was 1,479,134. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,142,238 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 64,538,059 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to no warrants being exercised during the period and no equity financings or private placements being completed during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We have a recent history of operating losses. It may be necessary for us to arrange for additional financing to meet our on-going growth initiatives. 
 
 Management believes it will be able to raise equity capital as required in the long term, but recognizes the risks attached thereto. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financing may be favorable. 
 
 Should financing not be available, the Company has adequate liquidity in the form of cash on hand to fund all of its planned capital expenditures and expansion plans as well as to continue to fund its operation over the next 12 months, including the planned build-out of its operations in Florida, the further expansion of operations in Nevada and California, the February 3, 2023 Illinois property acquisition, the February 7, 2023 acquisition of Planet 13 Illinois, and continuing build-out of its Illinois retail location. 
 
 Capital Management 
 
 Our capital consists of shareholders equity. Our objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate levels of funding to support the development of our businesses and maintain the necessary corporate and administrative functions to facilitate these activities. This is done primarily through equity financing and incurring debt. Future financings are dependent on market conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able to raise funds in the future. We invest all capital that is surplus to our immediate operational needs in short-term, highly liquid, and high-grade financial instruments. There were no changes to our approach to capital management during the year. We are not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022, or as of December 31, 2021, or as of the date hereof. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company s management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. 
 
 Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 

60

Table of Contents 

Financial statement areas that require significant judgments are as follows: 
 
 Estimated useful lives and depreciation of property and equipment, right-of-use assets 
 
 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets are dependent upon estimates of useful lives, which are determined through the exercise of judgment. Impairment of definite long-lived assets is influenced by judgment in defining an asset group and determining the indicators of impairment, and estimates used to measure impairment losses. Refer to Notes 6, 7 and 8 for further information. 
 
 Leases 
 
 The Company applies judgement in determining whether a contract contains a lease and if a lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease. 
 
 The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, which may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The lease term is used in determining classification between operating lease and finance lease, calculating the lease liability and determining the incremental borrowing rate. The Company has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After the commencement date of the lease, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g., construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customization to the leased asset). 
 
 The Company is required to discount lease payments using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The Company generally uses the incremental borrowing rate when initially recording real estate leases. Information from the lessor regarding the fair value of underlying assets and initial direct costs incurred by the lessor related to the leased assets is not available. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate the Company would pay to borrow over a similar term the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. 
 
 Definition of a business 
 
 Determination of what constitutes a business for purposes of acquisition accounting requires significant judgement. ASC 805 notes that if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not considered a business. However, the exact quantitative threshold is not explicitly defined. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed one acquisition, further described in Note 7. 
 
 Asset Impairment 
 
 Asset impairment tests require the allocation of assets to asset groups, where appropriate, which requires significant judgment and interpretation with respect to the integration between the assets and shared resources. Asset impairment tests require the determination of whether there is an indication of impairment. The assessment of whether an indication of impairment exists is performed at the end of each reporting period and requires the application of judgment, historical experience, and external and internal sources of information. 
 
 Deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of its assets and liabilities. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company routinely evaluates the likelihood of realizing the benefit of its deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it determines that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. 

61

Table of Contents 

In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers historical results and incorporates assumptions about the amount of future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The Company s assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage its underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the Company considers three years of cumulative operating income (loss). The income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect the Company s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and the Company s particular facts and circumstances. Although the Company believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted COVID-19 business recovery, could differ, and the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability has been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the established liability, the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. 
 
 Key estimates in these consolidated financial statements include: 
 
 Share-based compensation 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of options and warrants granted to employees and non-employees under share-based payment arrangements, where appropriate. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected term of the instrument, volatility of the Company s future share price, risk free rates, future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures at the initial grant date, by reference to the underlying terms of the instrument, and the Company s experience with similar instruments. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. Refer to Note 12 for further information. 
 
 Valuation of inventory 
 
 Inventory is comprised of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. Cannabis and hemp costs include expenditures directly related to the manufacturing process as well as suitable portions of related production overheads, based on normal operating capacity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of inventory and records inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories based on the estimated forecast of product demand, production requirements, market conditions, regulatory environment, and spoilage. A reserve is estimated to ensure the inventory balance at the end of the year reflects the estimates of product the Company expects to sell in the next year. Changes in the regulatory structure, lack of retail distribution locations or lack of consumer demand could result in future inventory reserves. 
 
 Impairment of indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill 
 
 The assessment of whether an indication of impairment exists is performed at the end of each reporting period and requires the application of judgment, historical experience, and external and internal sources of information. The Company makes estimates in determining the future cash flows and discount rates in the quantitative impairment test to compare the fair value to the carrying value.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Financial instrument classification and measurement 
 
 Our financial instruments carried on the annual audited consolidated statement of financial position are carried at amortized cost with the exception of cash, which is carried at fair value. There are no significant differences between the carrying value of financial instruments and their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2022, or December 31, 2021, due to the immediate or short-term maturities of the financial instruments. 
 
 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
 
 Our financial instruments include cash, deposits, accounts payable and accrued expenses and note payable. On December 31, 2022, the carrying value of cash is fair value. Financial instruments classified as loans and receivables and other financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are included in the amount initially recognized. Accounts payable and other liabilities, notes payable, and notes payable related parties have been classified as other financial liabilities. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to discharge its obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. Credit risk arises from cash with banks and financial institutions. It is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk arising from these financial instruments. The Company limits credit risk by entering into business arrangements with high credit-quality counterparties. 
 
 The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for credit losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the existing accounts receivable portfolio as of the reporting dates based on the estimate of expected net credit losses. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company currently does not carry variable interest-bearing debt. It is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk. 
 
 Currency Risk 
 
 As at December 31, 2022, a portion of the Company s financial assets and liabilities held in Canadian dollars consist of cash of 1,172,859 (2021 - 165,943). The Company s objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its net exposure to foreign currency cash flows by transacting, to the greatest extent possible, with third parties in the functional currency. The Company does not currently use foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure of its foreign currency cash flows as management has determined that this risk is not significant at this point in time. 
 
 The Company s exposure to a 10 change in the foreign exchange conversion rate at December 31, 2022 equals 117,286. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 
 The Company s approach to managing risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient cash and liquid investments to meet our commitments as they arise. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Where insufficient liquidity may exist, we may pursue various debt and equity instruments for short or long-term financing of our operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s financial liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, obligations under operating leases and taxes. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of 55,124,236 (December 31, 2021 - 68,274,639) and anticipate that revenue from operations will provide sufficient funds to cover all our operating expenditures for the next 12 months and available cash on hand will be sufficient to fund any and all capital expenditure requirements for the build-out of operations in the State of Florida and carry out other corporate initiatives over the next 12 months. 
 
 Further expansion of our cultivation facilities, production and manufacturing facilities and retail distribution facilities may require us to raise additional capital from outside sources. We will consider financing alternatives while contemplating minimal shareholder dilution.

Table of Contents 

The Company manages liquidity risk by reviewing its capital requirements on an ongoing basis. Historically, the Company s main source of funding has been the public issuance of common shares. The Company s access to financing is always uncertain. There can be no assurance of continued access to significant equity financing. Our potential sources of cash flow in the upcoming year will be from the proceeds of the sale of cannabis and cannabis related products and possible equity financings, loans, lease financing and entering into joint venture agreements, or any combination thereof. 
 
 Pricing Risk 
 
 Price risk is the risk that the trading price of the Company's shares will fluctuate and result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability. The Company is not exposed to significant price risk. 
 
 Concentration Risk 
 
 The Company operates primarily in Southern Nevada and Southern California. Should economic conditions deteriorate within those regions, its results of operations and financial position would be negatively impacted. 
 
 Banking Risk 
 
 Notwithstanding that a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there has been no change in US federal banking laws related to the deposit and holding of funds derived from activities related to the marijuana industry. Given that US federal law provides that the production and possession of cannabis is illegal, there is a strong argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty accessing the US banking system and traditional financing sources. The inability to open bank accounts with certain institutions may make it difficult to operate the business of the Company and leaves their cash holdings vulnerable. 
 
 Asset Forfeiture Risk 
 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under US federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture.

 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our co-CEOs and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the co-CEOs and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our co-CEOs and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on the assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, was effective. 
 
 In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management, with the participation of our co-CEOs and CFO, has limited the evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to exclude controls, policies and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting of the operations of Next Green Wave Holdings Inc. which we acquired on March 2, 2022. The operations of Next Green Wave Holdings Inc. represent approximately 9.4 of our total assets and 8.7 of our gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Independent Registered Accounting Firm's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As an emerging growth company, as defined under the terms of the JOBS Act of 2012, our independent registered accounting firm is not required to issue a report on the internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 
 
 In accordance with reduced disclosure rules applicable to emerging growth companies as set forth in Item 402 of Regulation S-K, this section explains how our compensation program is structured for the Co-CEOs and NEOs, as defined below. 
 
 Compensation Committee 
 
 The Board as a whole determines the level of compensation in respect of our senior executives. The Compensation Committee is appointed by and reports to the Board. The Compensation Committee, on behalf of the Board, establishes policies with respect to the compensation of our Co-CEOs, CFO and other senior executive officers. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in discharging the Board s oversight responsibilities relating to the attraction, compensation, evaluation and retention of key senior management employees, and in particular the Co-CEOs, with the skills and expertise needed to enable us to achieve our goals and strategies at fair and competitive compensation and appropriate performance incentives. 
 
 The Compensation Committee is responsible to review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the Co-CEOs and other senior executive officers compensation, evaluate the performance of the Co-CEOs and each senior executive officer s performance in light of those goals and objectives, and recommend to the Board for approval the compensation level each senior executive officer based on this evaluation. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for the review of our compensation systems in order to ensure the fairness and appropriateness of the compensation of senior executive officers that may participate, including incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. 
 
 Named Executive Officers 
 
 For the purpose of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a named executive officer NEO of the Company means each of the following individuals: 

each Co-CEO of the Company 

the two most highly compensated executive officers other than the Co-CEOs who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year and 

up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided under the above but for the fact that the individual was not serving as an executive officer at the end of the last completed fiscal year. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had four NEOs: Robert Groesbeck, Co-CEO; Larry Scheffler, Co-CEO; Dennis Logan, Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Wren, Vice President, Operations. 
 
 Elements of Compensation 
 
 In determining such compensation, the Compensation Committee will consider our performance and relative shareholder return and the compensation of CEOs and other senior executive officers at comparable companies. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may consider input from the Co-CEOs on senior executive compensation, but the Co-CEOs may not provide input with respect to their own compensation. 
 
 A combination of fixed and variable compensation is used to motivate executives to achieve overall company goals. The basic components of the executive compensation program are: 
 
 1. Base Salary. Base salary is the fixed portion of each executive officer s total compensation. It is designed to provide income certainty and retain executives. In determining the base level of compensation for the executive officers, weight is placed on the following objective factors: the particular responsibilities related to the position salaries or fees paid by companies of similar size in the industry level of experience and expertise and subjective factors such as leadership, commitment and attitude.

Table of Contents 

2. Short-Term Incentive Compensation . The short-term incentive compensation is intended to reward an executive officer for his or her yearly individual contribution and performance of personal objectives in the context of our overall annual performance. The short-term incentive compensation is designed to motivate executives annually to achieve their predetermined objectives. In determining compensation and, in particular, short-term incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider factors over which the executive officer can exercise control, such as their role in identifying and completing acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions into our business, meeting any budget targets established by controlling costs, taking successful advantage of business opportunities and enhancing our competitive and business prospects. 
 
 3. Stock Options . Stock options are a form of long-term equity incentive compensation granted from time to time to align executives interests with those of the Company and its shareholders and reward executives for their contribution to the creation of shareholder value. Participants benefit only if the market value of our Common Shares at the time of the stock option exercise is greater than the exercise price of the stock options at the time of grant. In establishing the number of stock options that may be granted, reference is made to the recommendations made by the Compensation Committee as well as, from time to time, the number of similar awards granted to officers and directors of other publicly-traded companies of similar size in the same business as us. The Compensation Committee and the Board also consider previous grants of stock options and the overall number of stock options that are outstanding relative to the number of outstanding securities in determining whether to make any new grants and the size and terms of any such grants. With respect to executive officers, the Compensation Committee and the Board also consider the level of effort, time, responsibility, ability, experience and level of commitment of the executive officer in determining the level of long-term equity incentive awards. With respect to directors, the Compensation Committee and the Board also consider committee assignments and committee chair responsibilities, as well as the overall time requirements of the Board members in determining the level of long-term equity incentive awards. 
 
 4. Restricted Share Units . Restricted Share Units are a form of long-term equity incentive compensation granted from time to time to align executives interests with those of the Company and its shareholders and to attract and retain executives. Restricted Share Units are notional shares that have the same value as Common Shares and earn dividend equivalents as additional units, at the same rate as dividends paid on Common Shares. No dividend equivalents will vest unless the associated Restricted Share Units also vest. In determining new grants of Restricted Share Units, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider factors similar to those contemplated when making new grants of stock options. 
 
 It is expected that stock options and Restricted Share Units held by management will be taken into consideration by the Compensation Committee at the time of any subsequent grants under the compensation plan in determining the amount or terms of any such subsequent award grants. The Compensation Committee will further consider the base salary, bonuses and competitive market factors. The size of a grant of an award is anticipated to be proportionate to the deemed ability of the individual to make an impact on our success, as determined by the Board. 
 
 We do not have a defined benefits plan, defined contribution plan, deferred compensation or pension or retirement plan applicable to our NEOs and no plans are currently in place in respect of change of control or termination.

Director Independence 
 
 Although the Common Shares are not listed on any U.S. national securities exchange, we use the definition of "independence" of Nasdaq to make the independence determination of our directors. Our board of directors is composed of two independent directors as defined under the rules of Nasdaq Nasdaq Rules ). Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that a director cannot be considered independent if: 

the director is, or at any time during the past three (3) years was, an employee of the company 

the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the three (3) years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exemptions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service) 

the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exemptions) 

the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three (3) years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity or 

the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three (3) years was a partner or employee of the company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit. 

Under such definitions, Adrienne O Neal and Michael Harman are each independent directors. Ms. O Neal and Mr. Harman are also considered independent and meet the other requirements under Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(A)(2)(i),(ii),(iii) and (iv) applicable to audit committee members and under Nasdaq Rule 5605(2)(A) applicable to compensation committee members. We also meet the director independence requirements for our listing with the OTCQX Best Market, being a minimum of two independent directors and a majority of the audit committee being comprised of independent directors. However, our shares are not currently quoted or listed on any U.S. national exchange or interdealer quotation system that has a requirement that a majority of our Board be independent.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Directors of 
 Planet 13 Holdings Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Planet 13 Holdings Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholder equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in United States Dollars)

i) Basis of consolidation 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities in which the Company has a controlling voting interest or is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Company and are deconsolidated from the date control ceases. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany balances and transactions. 
 
 These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the following entities which are subsidiaries of the Company: 
 
 Nevada license holding company; vertically integrated cannabis operations 
 BLC Management Company LLC Nevada, USA Management/holding company 
 LBC CBD LLC ("LBC") Nevada, USA CBD retail sales and marketing 
 Newtonian Principles Inc. California, USA California license holding company; cannabis retail sales 
 Crossgate Capital U.S. Holdings Corp. Nevada, USA Holding company 
 Next Green Wave, LLC California, USA California license holding company; cannabis cultivation and processing 
 Planet 13 Illinois, LLC Illinois, USA Illinois license holding company 
 BLC NV Food, LLC Nevada, USA Holding company for By The Slice LLC 
 By The Slice, LLC Nevada, USA Subsidiary of BLC NV Food, LLC; restaurant and retail operations 
 Planet 13 Chicago, LLC Illinois, USA Holding company 
 Planet 13 Florida, Inc. Florida, USA Florida license holding company 
 Club One Three, LLC Nevada, USA N/A Inactive 

ii) Variable interest entities 
 
 A variable interest entity VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to control the entity s activities or do not substantially participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Upon inception of a contractual agreement, and thereafter, if a reconsideration event occurs, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether the arrangement contains a variable interest in an entity and whether that entity is a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Where the Company concludes that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company consolidates the accounts of that VIE. 
 
 iii) Functional currency 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars USD ), which is the Company s and its subsidiaries functional currency. 

Foreign currency transactions are remeasured to the respective functional currencies of the Company s entities at the exchange rates in effect on the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured to functional currency at the foreign exchange rate applicable at the statement of balance sheets date. Non-monetary items are carried at historical rates. Non-monetary items carried at fair value denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to the functional currency at the date when the fair value was determined. Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized through profit or loss. 
 
 iv) Emerging growth company 
 
 The Company is an Emerging Growth Company , as defined in Section 2 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it has taken advantage of certain exemptions that are not applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Further, Section 102 (b) 1 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial reporting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public and private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. 

Building (in years) 
 Equipment (in years) 
 Leasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or remaining lease term 
 Construction in progress Not depreciated 

An assets residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each reporting period with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Depreciation of property and equipment commences when the asset is available for use. 
 
 Construction in progress includes construction progress payments, deposits, engineering costs and other costs directly related to the construction of the facilities. Expenditures are capitalized during the construction period and construction in progress in transferred to the relevant class of property and equipment when the assets are available for use, at which point in time the depreciation of the asset commences. 
 
 Property and equipment acquired in a business combination is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. 

(e) Goodwill impairment test 
 
 In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company s operations, for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The estimate of fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The Company determines fair values for each reporting unit using the income approach, when available and appropriate, the market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach involves forecasting projected financial information (such as revenue growth rates, profit margins, tax rates, working capital and capital expenditures) and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. 
 
 The Company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill as of December 31, or more frequently, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. 

For stock options granted, the Company uses the fair value of common stock at the date of grant. The Company does not estimate forfeiture rates when calculating compensation expense for stock options or RSUs. The Company records forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 Fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments issued to parties other than employees are measured on the date they are issued where there is no specific performance required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments. Share-based compensation transactions with non-employees are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Where fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments are granted to parties other than employees in exchange for notes or financing receivable, the note or receivable is presented in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheets. 

The following table represents the Company s disaggregated revenue by sales channel: 

Wholesale 
 
 Net revenues 

Loyalty Points Reward Programs 
 
 In certain of its markets, the Company offers a loyalty reward program to its dispensary customers that allows its customers to earn discounts on future purchases. Loyalty points are earned when a qualifying purchase is made. When a customer attains a certain number of points, the customer can redeem the credits on future in-store purchases. Loyalty points do not have an expiration date. 
 
 A portion of the revenue generated in a sale is allocated to the loyalty points earned. The amount allocated to the points earned is deferred until the loyalty points are redeemed. 
 
 Deferred Income 
 
 Deferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company s transfer of control of products or services to its customers and generally consists of unearned revenue from the Company s loyalty programs. The Company s deferred income balances were and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and were recorded within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recognized and , respectively, of net revenues from amounts recorded as deferred income. The deferred income balance as of December 31, 2022 is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. 
 
 The Company determined that no provision for returns or refunds was necessary as at December 31, 2022 or 2021 . 

ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The ROU assets also include any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. 
 
 For finance leases, lease expenses are the sum of interest on the lease obligations and amortization of the ROU assets, resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern. ROU assets are amortized based on the lesser of the lease term and the useful life of the leased asset according to the property and equipment accounting policy. If ownership of the ROU assets transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, amortization is calculated using the estimated useful life of the leased asset, according to the property and equipment accounting policy. For operating leases, the lease expenses are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded to lease expenses or, in the case of leases directly related to the cultivation of cannabis, in cost of goods sold in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 
 The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient, for each class of underlying asset, except real estate leases, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components of the lessee s contract and account for both components as a single lease component. 
 
 The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Short-term leases include real estate and vehicles and are not significant in comparison to the Company s overall lease portfolio. The Company continues to recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

for the year ended December 31, 2022 2021 - ). 

of the Company s revenue was generated in the United States. 

Deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of its assets and liabilities. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company routinely evaluates the likelihood of realizing the benefit of its deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it determines that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. 
 
 In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers historical results and incorporates assumptions about the amount of future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The Company s assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage its underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, the Company considers three years of cumulative operating income (loss). The income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect the Company s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and the Company s particular facts and circumstances. Although the Company believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted COVID- 19 business recovery, could differ, and the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability has been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the established liability, the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. 
 
 Key estimates in these consolidated financial statements include: 
 
 Share-based compensation 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of options and warrants granted to employees and non-employees under share-based payment arrangements, where appropriate. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected term of the instrument, volatility of the Company s future share price, risk free rates, future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures at the initial grant date, by reference to the underlying terms of the instrument, and the Company s experience with similar instruments. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. Refer to Note 12 for further information. 
 
 Valuation of inventory 
 
 Inventory is comprised of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. Cannabis and hemp costs include expenditures directly related to the manufacturing process as well as suitable portions of related production overheads, based on normal operating capacity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs an assessment of inventory and records inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories based on the estimated forecast of product demand, production requirements, market conditions, regulatory environment, and spoilage. A reserve is estimated to ensure the inventory balance at the end of the year reflects the estimates of product the Company expects to sell in the next year. Changes in the regulatory structure, lack of retail distribution locations or lack of consumer demand could result in future inventory reserves. 
 
 Impairment of indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill 
 
 The assessment of whether an indication of impairment exists is performed at the end of each reporting period and requires the application of judgment, historical experience, and external and internal sources of information. The Company makes estimates in determining the future cash flows and discount rates in the quantitative impairment test to compare the fair value to the carrying value. 

Packaging and miscellaneous 
 Work in progress 
 Finished goods 

Cost of Inventory is recognized as an expense when sold and included in cost of goods sold. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company recognized 2021 - of inventory expensed to cost of goods sold.

 On March 2, 2022, the Company acquired ownership interest of Next Green Wave Holdings, Inc. NGW and accounted for the transaction as a business combination pursuant to ASC 805. 
 
 NGW was incorporated in 2011 and was formed for the purpose of cultivating and selling cannabis products in the state of California, where it owns and operates a cultivation and manufacturing facility. The Company executed the NGW transaction in order to introduce certain of its brands to the California market; complement its dispensary operations in Santa Ana, California; and expand its California revenue base. 
 
 The aggregate purchase price for the NGW transaction was and consisted of in cash consideration, in replacement options and in share consideration. The share consideration was comprised of common shares of the Company at a fair value of C3.34 per common share, which were issued on March 2, 2022. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of consideration exchanged to the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired:

The purchase price allocations for the NGW transaction reflect various fair value estimates and analyses relating to the determination of fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and residual goodwill. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the acquired working capital, and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flow analyses, market data and management s estimates, prepared by an independent valuation firm. The estimated fair value of acquired working capital was determined to approximate carrying value. 
 
 The goodwill arising from the NGW transaction consists of expected synergies from combining operations of the Company and NGW, and intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as formulations, proprietary technologies and acquired know-how. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 
 
 NGW s state cannabis licenses and brands represented identifiable intangible assets acquired in the amounts of and , respectively. The NGW cannabis licenses acquired have an indefinite life and as such will not be subject to amortization while the brands have a definite useful life of three years. As of December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated whether intangible assets and goodwill showed any indicators of impairment, and it was determined that such indicators existed. As a result of the Company s analysis, it was determined that the brands and licenses were impaired, resulting in the Company recording an impairment charge of . 
 
 In connection with the NGW transaction, the Company expensed of acquisition-related costs, which have been included in general and administrative expenses on the Company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The carrying value of goodwill in each reporting unit is indicative of the expected growth and development of the business. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company identified qualitative indicators of impairment as a result of a downturn in the wholesale pricing of cannabis. The reduction in the price of wholesale cannabis resulted in a downward adjustment of the future financial forecasts for the Company s NGW business, which indicated that impairment of the goodwill asset was a more-likely-than- not outcome. A qualitative step zero impairment test was performed on the NGW business which indicated a potential impairment. The Company conducted a quantitative impairment analysis of its NGW reporting unit using the income approach as at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The recoverable amount of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated and the asset group to which indefinite life intangibles are allocated were determined based on fair value using Level 3 inputs in a discounted cash flow analysis. Management tested the NGW asset group for the definite lived assets impairment. The result was impairment for the definite lived assets of the NGW asset group. Where applicable, the Company uses its market capitalization and comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The significant assumptions applied in the determination of the recoverable amount are described below: 

Cash flows: Estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources as well as industry and market trends. Estimated cash flows are primarily driven by sales volumes, selling prices and operating costs. The forecasts are extended to a total of six years (and a terminal year thereafter); 

Terminal value growth rate: The terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and projected economic indicators and projected industry growth; 

Post-tax discount rate: The post-tax discount rate is reflective of the reporting unit's Weighted Average Cost of Capital ("WACC"). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta adjustment to the equity risk premium based on a direct comparison approach, an unsystematic risk premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and 

Tax rate: The tax rates used in determining the future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date. 

The following table outlines the key assumptions used in calculating the recoverable amount for each CGU and operating segment tested for impairment as at December 31, 2022:

Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of the NGW reporting unit exceeded the fair value and the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of during the year ended December 31, 2022, relating to the NGW reporting unit. 

Florida License Acquisition 
 
 On September 28, 2021, the Florida Department of Health s Office of Medical Marijuana Use OMMU approved the Company to acquire a license to operate a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center issued by the Florida Department of Health from a subsidiary of Harvest Health Recreation Inc. The acquisition closed with an effective date of October 1, 2021, and the Company released of restricted cash that was being held in escrow to the seller in exchange for receipt of the Medical Marijuana Treatment Center license. 
 
 The Company has capitalized in costs incurred to secure the license pursuant to the license acquisition.

 On February 2, 2021, the Company completed a bought deal financing for aggregate gross proceeds of CAD 69,028,750 at a price of CAD 7.00 per unit. The Company issued units of the Company. Each unit was comprised of common share in the capital of the Company and one -half of one Common Share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire common share at an exercise price of CAD 9.00 per common share for a period of months. 
 
 The Company also issued broker warrants that entitle the holder to purchase common share for a period of months from the closing of the offering at a price of CAD 7.00 per common share. The broker warrants were measured based on the fair market value of the warrants using a Black Scholes valuation model. 
 
 The Company incurred in cash share issuance costs and in broker warrant costs. The warrants are initially measured at fair value (Note 11 with residual proceeds being allocated to the common shares. Issuance costs have been allocated in the same proportion, with costs allocated to the warrant liability being expensed as incurred. The net proceeds were allocated as follows:

v. Shares issued on conversion of Class A Shares 
 
 The Class A restricted shares have equal ratable rights as the Company s common shares to dividends, all of the Company s assets that are available for distribution upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company s affairs, do not have pre-emptive rights, are entitled to receive notice and attend shareholders meetings and to exercise one vote for each Class A share held at all meetings of shareholders of the Company other than with respect to the vote for the election or removal of directors. Each Class A shareholder is able to convert each outstanding Class A share at the option of the holder thereof into one common share at any time provided that such conversion would not cause the Company to become a US Domestic Issuer. The restriction on conversion of Class A shares are designed to prevent the Company from becoming a US Domestic Issuer. Generally, a company will be considered to be a US Domestic Issuer if: 
 
 (A) or more of the holders of a company s common voting shares are U.S. Persons; and either (B) (i) the majority of the executive officers or directors of the Issuer are United States citizens or residents; (ii) the company has or more of its assets located in the United States; or (iii) the business of the company is principally administered in the United States. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, the Company failed the foreign private issuer FPI test and became a US domestic issuer effective January 1, 2022. 
 
 On May 6, 2021, the Company issued common shares on the conversion of Class A Shares. As of December 31, 2022 , there were longer any Class A Shares outstanding.

Deferred tax expense (recovery) 
 Origination and reversal of timing differences

The actual income tax provision differs from the expected amount calculated by applying the statutory income tax rate to the loss before tax. These differences result from the following: 
 Statutory income tax rate 
 Income tax expense at statutory rate 
 Increase (reduction) in income taxes resulting from: 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability 
 Other non-taxable amounts 
 Change in valuation allowance 
 Difference in rates

 Income tax expense (benefit) 

Section 280E prohibits businesses engaged in the trafficking of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances from deducting normal business expenses, such as payroll and rent, from gross income (revenue less cost of goods sold). Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance for Federal purposes, the Internal Revenue Service IRS has subsequently applied Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. Cannabis businesses operating in states that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses from taxable income subject to state taxes. The non-taxable amounts shown in the effective rate reconciliation above include the impact of applying IRC Section 280E to the Company's businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other typical non-deductible expenses. As the application and IRS interpretations on Section 280E continue to evolve, the impact of this cannot be reliably estimated. Any changes to the application of Section 280E may have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company has the legal right and intent to offset. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are attributable to the following: 

Share issue costs 
 Stock compensation 
 Exchange rate difference on monetary assets 
 Accrued expenses 
 Property and equipment 
 Licenses 
 Deferred tax assets (liabilities)

As at December 31, 2022 , the Company has December 31, 2021 - in Canadian non-capital loss carryforwards that expire between 2037 and 2042. In addition, as at December 31, 2022 , the Company has U.S. federal Net Operating Losses of December 31, 2021 - ). The US federal Net Operating Losses attributable to 2020 onward will have an indefinite carry forward. As at December 31, 2022 , the Company has California State Net Operating Losses of December 31, 2021 - ). The California state Net Operating Losses will expire in 2040. 
 
 In March 2020, the U.S. enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the Act ). The Act, among other provisions, reinstates the ability of corporations to carry net operating losses back to the five preceding tax years, has increased the excess interest limitation on modified taxable income from 30 percent to 50 percent. The Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and has concluded that the Act has not had a significant effect on the deferred tax balances. 
 
 The Company believes that, pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code, even though it is organized as a Canadian corporation, the Company should be treated as a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the Company is a taxable corporation in Canada, it is likely to be subject to income taxation in both the United States and Canada on the same income, which in turn, may reduce the amount of income available for distribution to shareholders. The balance of this discussion assumes the Company is a U.S. domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, no tax opinion or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service IRS concerning the U.S. federal income tax characterization of the Company has been obtained and none will be requested. Thus, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the characterization of the Company as a domestic corporation, or that if challenged, a U.S. court would not agree with the IRS. If the Company is not treated as a U.S. domestic corporation, then the acquisition, ownership and disposition of common shares, warrants and common shares received on the exercise of warrants may have materially different implications for Non-U.S. Holders.

outstanding construction commitments as of December 31, 2022 . 
 
 (b) Contingencies 
 
 The Company's operations are subject to a variety of local and state regulation. Failure to comply with one or more of those regulations could result in fines, restrictions on its operations, or losses of permits that could result in the Company ceasing operations. While management of the Company believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable local and state regulations at December 31, 2022 , medical and adult use cannabis regulations continue to evolve and are subject to differing interpretations. As a result, the Company may be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, or restrictions in the future. 
 
 (c) Claims and Litigation 
 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 , there were pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the results of the Company s operations. There are also no proceedings in which any of the Company s directors, officers or affiliates is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to the Company s interest. 
 
 (d) Operating Licenses 
 
 Although the possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in Nevada, California, Florida and Illinois, marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the Company s inability to proceed with our business plans. In addition, the Company s assets, including real property, cash, equipment, and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because marijuana is still federally illegal. 

Price risk 
 
 Price risk is the risk that the trading price of the Company's shares will fluctuate and result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability. The Company is not exposed to significant price risk. 
 
 Liquidity risk 
 
 The Company s approach to managing risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s financial liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, obligations under operating leases and taxes. The Company manages liquidity risk by reviewing its capital requirements on an ongoing basis. Historically, the Company s main source of funding has been the public issuance of common shares. The Company s access to financing is always uncertain. There can be no assurance of continued access to significant equity financing. 
 
 Concentration risk 
 
 The Company operates primarily in Southern Nevada and Southern California. Should economic conditions deteriorate within that region, its results of operations and financial position would be negatively impacted. 
 
 Banking Risk 
 
 Notwithstanding that a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there has been no change in US federal banking laws related to the deposit and holding of funds derived from activities related to the marijuana industry. Given that US federal law provides that the production and possession of cannabis is illegal, there is a strong argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty accessing the US banking system and traditional financing sources. The inability to open bank accounts with certain institutions may make it difficult to operate the business of the Company and leaves their cash holdings vulnerable. 
 
 Asset Forfeiture Risk 
 
 Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under US federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property was never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. 
 
 Currency rate risk 
 
 As at December 31, 2022 , a portion of the Company s financial assets and liabilities held in Canadian dollars consist of cash of 2021 - ). The Company s objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its net exposure to foreign currency cash flows by transacting, to the greatest extent possible, with third parties in the functional currency. The Company does not currently use foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure of its foreign currency cash flows as management has determined that this risk is not significant at this point in time. 
 
 The Company s exposure to a 10 change in the foreign exchange conversion rate at December 31, 2022 equals .
