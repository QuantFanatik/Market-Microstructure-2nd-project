adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets;

 Cullman Savings Bank 
 
 Cullman Savings Bank is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Cullman, Alabama. Cullman Savings Bank was originally chartered in 1887 under the name Cullman Building Loan. In 1994, we converted to a federal savings bank charter and changed our name to Cullman Savings Bank. In 2009, we reorganized from the mutual to the stock form of ownership in connection with our initial mutual holding company reorganization. 
 
 Cullman Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Cullman Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Our website address is www.cullmansavingsbank.com . Information on our website is not considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Available Information 
 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is a public company, and files current, quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and any amendments to these reports are available for free on our website, www.cullmansavingsbank.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC (http://www.sec.gov). 
 
 General 
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans, multi-family real estate loans and consumer loans. We also invest in limited amounts of securities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We also use Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund our operations. 
 
 Market Area		 
 
 We conduct our operations from our main office and three additional branch offices, two of which are located in Cullman, Alabama, and one in Hanceville, Alabama. All of our branch offices are located in Cullman County, Alabama. Cullman County, which is largely suburban and rural in nature, is located in north-central Alabama between the cities of Birmingham (approximately 50 miles away) and Huntsville (approximately 55 miles away). We consider Cullman County our primary market area for lending and deposits. 

5 

Cullman County s local economy is somewhat diversified, with employment in wholesale/retail trade, education/healthcare/social services and services comprising the largest employment sectors. Other major employment sectors include finance/insurance/real estate and construction. In addition, many of our residents commute to Birmingham or Huntsville for employment due to the location of those cities compared to Cullman. 
 
 Cullman County s population, which is estimated to be approximately 91,000 as of January 2023, increased at an annual growth rate of 1.7 from 2018 to January 2023, versus comparable Alabama and U.S. population growth rates of 0.8 and 0.5 , respectively. The number of households in Cullman County increased at a 1.6 annual rate from 2018 to January 2023, which exceeded the Alabama and U.S. household growth rates of 1.1 and 0.7 , respectively. Projected five-year population and household growth rates for Cullman County are above the projected growth rates for Alabama and the U.S. 
 
 Cullman County s January 2023 median household income of 55,021 was below the Alabama median of 59,526 and even further below the U.S. median of 73,503. Similarly, per capita income and household income distribution measures also reflected lower levels of income for Cullman County and Alabama relative to the comparable U.S. measures. Cullman County s somewhat rural characteristics and lower cost of living are considered factors that contribute to its comparatively lower income measures. Over the next five years, Cullman County is projected to experience lower growth rates in per capita income relative to the projected Alabama and U.S. growth rates (2.3 versus 2.9 and 2.6 , respectively). 
 
 The median sales price for a home in Cullman County decreased to 232,500 in December 2022 compared to 239,900 in December 2021. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We face competition within our local market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. We also face competition from savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, financial technology or fintech companies and credit unions and, with respect to deposits, from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. As of June 30, 2022 (the most recent date for which data is available), our market share of deposits represented 13.0 of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured deposits in Cullman County, ranking us fifth in market share of deposits out of 12 institutions operating in Cullman County. 
 
 Lending Activities 
 General. Our principal lending activity is the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans, and, to a lesser extent, multi-family mortgage loans, construction loans, land loans, home equity loans, commercial loans and consumer loans. 
 Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sale. In addition to the loans included in the table below, at December 31, 2022, we had 8.0 million of loans in process. At December 31, 2022 we had no loans held for sale.

One- to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Lending . We originate long-term permanent loans secured by mortgages on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2022, 172.2 million, or 51.7 of our total loan portfolio, consisted of permanent loans on one- to four-family residences. At that date, our average outstanding one- to four-family residential real estate loan balance was 179,000 and our largest outstanding residential loan had a principal balance of 2.2 million. Virtually all of the residential loans we originate are secured by properties located in our market area. 
 
 Many of our recent originations are 15- to 30-year fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. We generally originate our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans in accordance with secondary market standards to permit their sale on a servicing-released basis. However, to accommodate customers, we will originate loans that do not conform with secondary market standards, and we will usually hold such loans in our portfolio. 
 In order to reduce the term to repricing of our loan portfolio, we also originate adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Our current adjustable-rate mortgage loans carry interest rates that adjust annually based on the Enterprise 11 th District Cost of Funds Index Replacement Index published by Freddie Mac. Many of our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans have fixed rates for initial terms of five or ten years. Such loans carry terms to maturity of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2022, 2.6 million, or 1.5 of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans, had adjustable rates of interest. 
 We evaluate both the borrower s ability to make principal, interest and escrow payments and the value of the property that will secure the loan. Our one- to-four family residential mortgage loans do not currently include prepayment penalties, are non-assumable and do not produce negative amortization. Our one- to-four family residential mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses giving us the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage. We currently originate residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with loan-to-value ratios of up to 89.99 for owner-occupied one- to-four family homes and up to 80 for non-owner occupied homes. 
 Commercial Real Estate Lending . In recent years, we have sought to increase our commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, retail and mixed-use properties and restaurants located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2022, we had 96.0 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 28.8 of our total loan portfolio. 
 Most of our commercial real estate loans have a five-year balloon term with amortization periods of up to 20 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 85 . At December 31, 2022, our largest commercial real estate loan totaled 7.4 million and was secured by storage units. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
 Classified within our commercial real estate loans are land loans. We make a limited amount of land loans to complement our construction lending activities, and such loans are generally secured by lots that will be used for commercial real estate development. Land loans also include loans secured by farm land and land purchased for investment purposes. Land loans are generally offered for terms of up to 15 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of land loans is 75 .

We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors or by internal evaluations, where permitted by regulation. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate borrowers and, in the case of church loans, guarantees from the applicable denomination are generally obtained. 
 Commercial Business Lending . We originate commercial business loans and lines of credit to small- and medium-sized companies in our primary market area. Our commercial business loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. The commercial business loans that we offer are fixed-rate loans, generally for a one-year term. Our commercial business loan portfolio consists primarily of secured loans, along with a small amount of unsecured loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 32.2 million of commercial business loans outstanding, representing 9.7 of the total loan portfolio, and we may increase this type of lending in the future. 
 When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, the lending history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral, if any, and whether the loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Commercial business loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. 
 At December 31, 2022, our largest commercial business loan relationship totaled 3.1 million and was secured by sales tax receipts. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
 Multi-Family Real Estate Lending . At December 31, 2022, we had 3.7 million in multi-family real estate loans, representing 1 . 1 of our total loan portfolio. The multi-family real estate loans we originate generally have a maximum amortization term of 20 years and are secured by apartment buildings located within our primary market area. Our multi-family real estate loans are structured as balloon loans, with interest rates on these loans generally fixed for an initial period of three to five years and then adjusted based on current market rates and competition. These loans are generally made in amounts of up to 80 of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property with an appropriate projected debt service coverage ratio. 
 Our underwriting procedures include considering the borrower s expertise and require verification of the borrower s credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, references and income projections for the property. We generally obtain personal guarantees on these loans. 
 	 At December 31, 2022, our largest multi-family loan had a balance of 999,000 and was secured by an apartment complex. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its contractual terms. 
 Construction Lending. We make construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and, to a limited extent, loans to builders and commercial borrowers for owner-occupied projects. At December 31, 2022, our construction loans totaled 18.5 million, representing 5.6 of our total loan portfolio. 
 
 9 

Loans to individuals for the construction of their residences typically have initial terms for up to 12 months and then convert to permanent loans. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one-to-four family residential loans offered by us. During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of owner-occupied single-family construction loans is 85 . Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential loans. 
 At December 31, 2022, our largest consumer construction loan was for 1.3 million, all of which was outstanding. This loan was performing according to its contractual terms at December 31, 2022. 
 Home Equity Lending. We originate variable-rate and fixed-rate home equity lines of credit secured by a lien on the borrower s primary residence. Our home equity products are limited to 89.99 of the property value less any other mortgages when we hold the first mortgage, and 80 when we do not hold the first mortgage. We use the same underwriting standards for home equity lines of credit as we use for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 6.7 million or 2.0 of our total loans in home equity loans and outstanding advances under home equity lines of credit and an additional 9.7 million of funds committed, but not advanced, under home equity lines of credit. 
 Consumer Lending. We originate limited amounts of consumer loans apart from home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, we had 3.7 million of consumer loans outstanding, representing 1.1 of the total loan portfolio. Consumer loans consist of loans secured by deposits, automobile loans and miscellaneous other types of installment loans. 
 Loan Underwriting Risks 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors to provide monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual financial statements, depending on the size of the loan, on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have an aggregate debt service ratio, including the guarantor s cash flows and the borrower s other projects, of at least 1.15x. 
 If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Our commercial and industrial loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, collateral for commercial and industrial loans consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. 
 Construction Loans. Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations. 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation 
 
 10 

of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. 
 Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying collateral also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. 
 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential real estate loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
 Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans 
 Lending activities are conducted primarily by our salaried loan personnel operating at our main office. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed-rate loans or adjustable-rate loans depends on relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates. We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. 
 We sell certain loans we originate into the secondary market. We consider the pricing for loans as well as the current interest rate environment in making decisions as to whether to hold the mortgage loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. At December 31, 2022, we had no loans held for sale. We sell loans on a best efforts basis, and we generally have not retained the servicing rights on the mortgage loans sold in the secondary mortgage market. 
 From time to time, to diversify our risk, we will purchase or sell participation interests in loans. We underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At December 31, 2022, we had 1.5 million in loan participation interests. We generally do not purchase whole loans from third parties to supplement our loan production. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that Cullman Savings Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15 of Cullman Savings Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus (25 if the amount in excess of 15 is secured by readily marketable collateral or 30 for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2022, based on the 15 limitation, Cullman Savings Bank s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately 10.7 million. At December 31, 2022, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was 8.2 million, which consists of 11 loans, the largest being 5.0 million secured by a warehouse. All of the underlying loans were performing in accordance with its contractual terms on that date. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed 
 
 11 

primarily to determine the borrower s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. 
 All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans (total credit exposure), including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. Our Chief Executive Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to 500,000. Our Director of Lending and our EVP/Chief Operations Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to 250,000. An individual loan or aggregate credit commitment in excess of 3.0 million requires approval by the Chief Executive Officer, Director of Lending and EVP/Chief Operations Officer, along with the Loan Committee, and must be reported to the board of directors prior to the loan transaction occurring. 
 Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as extended coverage in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. 
 Delinquencies and Asset Quality 
 Delinquency Procedures . When a borrower fails to make a required monthly loan payment by the last day of the month, a late notice is generated stating the payment and late charges due. Our policies provide borrowers that become 60 days or more delinquent are contacted by phone or mail to determine the reason for nonpayment and to discuss future payments, although in practice we generally contact such borrowers within 30 days. If repayment is not possible or doubtful, the loan will be brought to the board of directors for possible foreclosure. Once the board of directors declares a loan due and payable, a certified letter is sent to the borrower explaining the entire balance of the loan is due and payable. The borrower is permitted ten additional days to submit payment. If the loan is reinstated, foreclosure proceedings will be discontinued and the borrower will be permitted to continue to make payments. If the borrower does not respond, we will initiate foreclosure proceedings. 
 Loans Past Due and Non-Performing Assets . Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method. 
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal or evaluation to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 A loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the interest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal amount due.

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which 
 
 13 

do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100 of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, such that additional general or specific loss allowances may be required. 
 In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses.

Investment Activities 
 General . The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity, meet pledging requirements, generate a reasonable rate of return, and minimize credit and interest rate risk. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity. 
 Our investment policy is reviewed annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (all investment decisions require the approval of both investment officers). All investment transactions are reviewed at regularly scheduled quarterly meetings of the board of directors. 
 Our current investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities and, to a lesser extent, mutual funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities. Our investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in bank-owned life insurance, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities, real estate mortgage investment conduits, Alabama revenue bonds and municipal securities. 
 At December 31, 2022, our investment securities portfolio totaled 29.8 million, and consisted primarily of securities and obligations issued by municipalities and mortgage-backed securities. In addition, at December 31, 2022, we owned 1.2 million of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock and 794,000 of Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta stock. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, we are required to purchase stock, which stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.

Sources of Funds 
 General . Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits . Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We have the authority to accept brokered deposits, and had 5.5 million of such deposits as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we had 38.2 million of municipal deposits at December 31, 2022. 
 On a periodic basis, we establish interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of Cullman Savings Bank in the community to attract and retain local deposits. We also seek to obtain deposits from our commercial loan customers. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand. Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type at the dates indicated.

 TAXATION		 
 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and Cullman Savings Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Cullman Bancorp, Inc. or Cullman Savings Bank. Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 Federal Taxation 
 Conversion. Effective July 15, 2021, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. a federal corporation (Cullman Federal) acquired the assets, liabilities and equity of Cullman Savings Bank, MHC, under the tax-free merger rules and within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, wherein Cullman Savings Bank, MHC ceased to exist upon merging with and into Cullman Federal as the surviving entity. Upon this merger and on this same date, Cullman Federal ceased to exist upon merging with and into Cullman Bancorp, Inc (a Maryland corporation) as the surviving entity, constituting a mere change in identity form or place of organization within the meaning and under the tax-free reorganization rules of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Method of Accounting . Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and Cullman Savings Bank currently report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing their federal income tax returns. Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and Cullman Savings Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, Cullman Savings Bank has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. It currently utilizes the experience method under Section 585 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ). 
 Alternative Minimum Tax . For income generated for tax years ending after January 1, 2023, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 15 on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as alternative minimum taxable income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the alternative minimum tax for income generated for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 and ending before December 31, 2022, wherein the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act reinstated the alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning January 1, 2023 or later. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2022, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. had no minimum tax credit carryovers. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers . As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally, a financial institution may carry net operating losses forward indefinitely, if incurred after December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2022, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. had no federal net operating loss carryforwards 
 Corporate Dividends . Cullman Bancorp, Inc. may generally exclude from its income 100 of dividends received from Cullman Savings Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 State Taxation 
 
 19 

Alabama State Taxation . Alabama reorganization and conversion rules follow the federal rules of reorganization and conversion rules. Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and Cullman Savings Bank are required to file Alabama income tax returns and pay tax at a stated tax rate of 6.5 of Alabama taxable income. For these purposes, Alabama taxable income generally means federal taxable income subject to certain modifications, primarily the exclusion of interest income on United States obligations and the deduction of federal income taxes paid. 
 Maryland State Taxation . As a Maryland business corporation, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the State of Maryland. 
 
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION	 
 
 General 
 As a federal savings bank, Cullman Savings Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as deposit insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Cullman Savings Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of security holders. Cullman Savings Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 
 	Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; provide oversight for the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings, interest rate sensitivity and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Cullman Savings Bank, or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Many financial consumer protection statutes are implemented by regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For federal savings banks of Cullman Savings Bank s asset size, compliance with such statutes and regulations is determined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency through its examinations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 
 As a savings and loan holding company, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and Cullman Savings Bank. 
 
 	Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Cullman Savings Bank and Cullman Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Cullman Savings Bank and Cullman Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities . Federal savings banks with less than 20 billion of assets as of December 31, 2017 may elect to exercise national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter. As of December 31, 2022, Cullman Savings Bank has exercised 
 
 20 

the covered savings association (CSA) election. A CSA has the same rights and privileges as a national bank, but retains its federal savings association charter. 
 
 Capital Requirements . The bank implemented the community bank leverage ratio which removes the requirement for qualifying banking organizations to calculate and report risk-based capital but rather only requires a Tier 1 to average assets (leverage) ratio. Qualifying banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage rate framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than required minimums will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies capital rules (generally applicable rule) and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The community bank leverage ratio minimum requirement is 9.0 for calendar year 2022 and beyond. Eligible institutions may opt into and out of the community bank ratio framework on their quarterly call report. Cullman Savings Bank has opted in to the community bank leverage framework. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets e.g. , recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cullman Savings Bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower . Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the excess is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2022, Cullman Savings Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
 Capital Distributions . Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends and other transactions charged to the savings bank s capital account. A federal savings bank must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if: 
 
 the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank s retained net income for the preceding two years; 

the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 

the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or 

the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institution s financial condition. 

21 

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Cullman Savings Bank, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 
 
 A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
 
 the federal savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 

the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 

the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. 

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act generally provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings bank also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws . All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings bank s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings bank s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. In May 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the Community Reinvestment Act regulations and framework. 
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to publicly disclose their rating. Cullman Savings Bank received a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 
 Transactions with Related Parties . An insured depository institution s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as Cullman Savings Bank. Cullman Bancorp, Inc. will be an affiliate of Cullman Savings Bank because of its control of Cullman Savings Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
 
 Cullman Savings Bank s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 
 be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 

not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Cullman Savings Bank s capital. 

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Cullman Savings Bank s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
 22 

Enforcement . The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings bank. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The maximum penalties that can be assessed are generally based on the type and severity of the violation, unsafe and unsound practice or other action, and are adjusted annually for inflation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings bank. If such action is not taken, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness . Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Branching . Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. In addition, federal savings banks may establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Action . Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more additional restrictions, including a regulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, ceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 
 23 

The previously referenced final rules establishing an elective community bank leverage ratio regulatory capital framework provide that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered well-capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cullman Savings Bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured financial institutions such as Cullman Savings Bank, generally up to a maximum of 250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution s failure within three years. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Cullman Savings Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Privacy Regulations . Federal regulations generally require that Cullman Savings Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer s non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship. In addition, Cullman Savings Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Cullman Savings Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
 USA PATRIOT Act . Cullman Savings Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial institutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements. 
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements . Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 
 Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Cullman Savings Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and 

24 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

The deposit operations of Cullman Savings Bank also are subject to, among others, the: 
 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 Cullman Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Cullman Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2022. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Cullman Savings Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock. At December 31, 2022, no impairment had been recognized. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Cullman Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Cullman Savings Bank. 
 
 The business activities of savings and loan holding companies are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations, unless the holding company has elected financial holding company status. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Cullman Bancorp Inc. has not elected financial holding company status. Federal law generally prohibits the acquisition of more than 5 of a class of voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities. 
 
 	Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5 of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state savings and loan holding companies. 
 
 Savings and loan holding companies with less than 3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength doctrine that require holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 
 25 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition. The guidance also provides for prior consultation with supervisory staff for material increases in the amount of a company's common stock dividend. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. Federal Reserve Board guidance also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result, at the end of a quarter, in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
 Change in Control Regulations 
 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Cullman Bancorp, Inc., unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act, means ownership, control of or the power to vote 25 or more of any class of voting stock. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock under certain circumstances, such as where the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a final rule revising its framework for determining whether a company has a controlling influence over a bank or savings and loan holding company for purposes of the Bank and Savings and Loan Holding Company Acts. 
 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in Cullman Bancorp, Inc. s public offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Cullman Bancorp, Inc. meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1 of the outstanding shares of Cullman Bancorp, Inc., or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 

26 

Cullman Bancorp, Inc. is an emerging growth company. For as long as Cullman Bancorp, Inc. continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, Cullman Bancorp, Inc. also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are 1.07 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million at the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.

 ITEM 7. 	 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The objective of this section is to help readers understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview	 
 Total assets increased 68.5 million, or 19.3 , to 423.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 354.7 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in loans funded by cash and an increase in deposits and borrowings . Total deposits increased 60.9 million, or 26.3 , to 292.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 232.0 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits was due to increases in regular savings and other deposits categories, as we have grown accounts throughout the year. 
 Net income increased 2.4 million, or 139.0 , to 4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to the one-time pre-tax 1.6 million expense for the contribution of common stock and cash to our new charitable foundation in the third quarter of 2021. The additional increase was due to increases in interest income and a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and income tax expense. Interest income increased 3.2 million, or 23.6 , to 16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income on loans, which is our 
 
 28 

primary source of interest income. Interest expense decreased 421,000, or 23.6 , to 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to a decrease of 55,000 in interest expense on deposits and a decrease of 366,000 in interest expense on borrowings. 
 We recorded provisions for loan losses of 438,000 and 60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses was 2.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2.4 million at December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.85 at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.94 at December 31, 2021, while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 850.60 at December 31, 2022 compared to 810.10 at December 31, 2021. We had charge-offs of 44,000 and recoveries of 41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
 The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have determined to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 The following represent our significant accounting policies: 
 Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. Loans are charged off when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgment. The evaluation process involves gathering and interpreting many qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses. Because interpretation and analysis involves judgment, current economic or business conditions can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses could change significantly. 
 The allocation methodology applied by Cullman Savings Bank is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and includes allocations for specifically identified impaired loans and loss factor allocations for all remaining loans, with a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors. The methodology includes evaluation and consideration of several factors, such as, but not limited to, management s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. While management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or circumstances underlying the collectability of loans. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. Management believes the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The allowance analysis is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, various regulatory 
 
 29 

agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. 
 We will be adopting the current expected credit losses CECL methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, effective January 1, 2023. For additional information about the adoption of CECL see Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Income Taxes . The assessment of income tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretation, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the results of operations and reported earnings. 
 
 Cullman Bancorp, Inc. files consolidated federal and state income tax returns with Cullman Savings Bank. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax law rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income tax expense. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that a portion of the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We may also recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured in the consolidated financial statements. Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 
 
 Total assets increased 68.5 million, or 19.3 , to 423.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 354.7 at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in loans funded from cash and an increase in deposits and borrowings. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased 25.3 million to 36.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 61.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to an increase in loans funded. 
 
 Gross loans held for investment increased 78.2 million, or 30.7 , to 332.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 254.6 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in one-to-four family residential real estate loans, which increased 44.4 million, or 34.8 , to 172.2 million at December 31, 2022 from 127.8 million at December 31, 2021. Commercial real estate loans have increased 19.0 million, or 24.7 to 96.0 million at December 31, 2022 from 77.0 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Securities available-for-sale increased 8.5 million, or 39.8 , to 29.8 million at December 31, 2022 from 21.3 million at December 31, 2021. We purchased 3.0 million in U.S. Government agency securities during 2022 as well as 11.0 million in mortgage backed securities, 1.0 million in commercial mortgage backed securities and 715,000 in municipal securities in order to pledge the increase in our deposits under the Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement program. 
 
 Total deposits increased 60.9 million, or 26.3 , to 292.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 232.0 at December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits was due to increases in regular savings and other deposits categories, as we have grown accounts. Interest bearing demand accounts increased 46.3 million or 67.7 to 114.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 68.6 million at December 31, 2021. Regular savings and other deposits increased 24.3 million, or 44.0 , to 79.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 55.3 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 We had 25.0 million of borrowings at December 31, 2022, compared to 18.5 million of borrowings at December 31, 2021. During the year, we had excess liquidity and paid off the 18.5 million of borrowings recognizing a net gain of 87. Later in the year, we increased our borrowings based on increased loan demand during 2022. We regularly review or liquidity position based on alternative uses of available funds as well as market conditions. 
 
 Shareholders' equity increased by 448,000, or 0.4 , to 100.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 99.7 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was due to earnings during the year, partially offset by an increase in other comprehensive loss. Stockholders equity (book value) per share at December 31, 2022 was 13.55. We had no intangible assets at December 31, 2022.

Average Balance Sheets 
 The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the years indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 General. Net income increased 2.4 million, or 139.0 , to 4.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the one-time pre-tax 1.6 million expense for the contribution of common stock and cash to the Foundation in the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, there was an increase in interest income, with the changes in interest income and interest expense primarily due to changes in the market interest rates, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and income tax expense. 
 
 Interest Income. Interest income increased 3.2 million, or 23.6 , to 16.5 million at December 31, 2022 from 13.4 million at December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income. Interest income on loans increased 2.4 million, or 19.1 , to 15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our average balance of loans increased 59.1 million, or 24.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is due to the increase in our loan demand. Our weighted average yield on loans decreased 22 basis points to 5.05 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 5.27 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was a reflection of the low rate environment when the loans were originated. Additionally, we recognized 378,000 of interest income on PPP loans during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 421,000, or 23.6 , to 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to a decrease of 55,000 in interest expense on deposits and a decrease of 366,000 in interest expense on borrowings in 2022. 
 
 The decrease in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit, which decreased 208,000, or 22.8 , to 705,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 913,000 for the year ended 
 
 34 

December 31, 2021. We experienced decreases in both the average balance of and rates paid on certificates of deposit. We have allowed higher-rate certificates of deposit to run off during the current interest rate environment. Interest paid on other deposit types increased due to an increase in rates. Regular savings and other deposits interest expense increased 127,000 or 135.1 and interest bearing demand deposits interest expense increased 28,000 or 29.5 . 
 
 Interest expense on borrowings decreased 366,000, or 54.1 , and was 310,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 676,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average rate we paid on borrowings increased to 4.07 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.75 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average balances decreased 31.0 million, or 80.3 , to 7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 3.6 million, or 30.9 , to 15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of our interest income increasing faster than our interest expense. Our interest rate spread increased 74 basis points to 4.04 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.30 for the year ended December 31, 2021, while our net interest margin increased 73 basis points to 4.19 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.46 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Provision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses are charged to operations to establish an allowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management's ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical specific loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loan or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information. 
 
 After an evaluation of these factors, we recorded provisions for loan losses of 438,000 and 60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses was 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.85 at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.94 at December 31, 2021, while the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 850.6 at December 31, 2022 compared to 810.1 at December 31, 2021. We had charge-offs of 44,000 and recoveries of 41,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate at December 31, 2022. However, future changes in the factors we use to calculate the allowance for loan losses, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to our loan portfolio, could result in material increases in our provision for loan losses. In addition, the Office of Comptroller of Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. 
 
 Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased 177,000, or 11.7 , to 1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 177,000, or 20.9 , as we have increased the number of deposit accounts.

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased due to in an increase in employees as well as annual salary increases and rising benefits expense. Professional and supervisory expenses increased due to inflation cost from our vendors. Data processing expense increased due to the annual increase based on the consumer price index included in our contract with our core data processor. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. We recognized income tax expense of 1.1 million and 344,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in effective rates of 20.8 and 16.4 . Income tax expense increased as a result of higher income before income taxes in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a net loss related to the contribution to the Foundation in 2021. 
 Management of Market Risk 
 General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of members of senior management, is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. 
 We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 growing our volume of core deposit accounts; 

selling long-term, fixed-rate loans, depending on pricing; 

holding higher levels of cash and cash equivalents; 

continuing the diversification of our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans, which typically have shorter maturities; and 

laddering the maturities of our investment securities and our borrowings. 

36 

By following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates. 
 We generally do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. 
 Net Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by up to 400 basis points or decreases instantaneously by up to 200 basis points, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3 to 4 would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the Change in Interest Rates column below. 
 The tables below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

The table above indicates that at December 31, 2022, in th e event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 5.22 increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 8.85 decrease in net interest income. At December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced an 11.94 increase in net interest income, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 8.45 decrease in net interest income. 
 Net Economic Value . We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity, or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve instantaneously by up to 400 basis points or decreases instantaneously by up to 200 basis points, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.

At December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 10.70 decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 3.76 decrease in EVE. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and net economic value tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates, and actual results may differ. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables. 
 Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a 96.3 million and a 111.3 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, and had 25.0 million and 18.5 million outstanding as of those dates, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had an unsecured federal funds line of credit of 10.0 million. No amount was outstanding on this line of credit at December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 5.8 million and 5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of investment securities and bank owned life insurance, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was 97.6 million and 22.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, consisting primarily of activity in deposit accounts and proceeds from Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, offset by repayment of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, was 66.5 million and 19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, Cullman Savings Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, and was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2022. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. 
 
 The net proceeds from the offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including funding loans. Our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the offering, which will increase our net interest-earning assets and net interest income. However, due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the offering, as well as other factors associated with the offering, our return on equity has been adversely affected following the offering. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Please refer to Note 1 to the audited financial statements included with this document for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. 
 Cullman, Alabama 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cullman Bancorp, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2005.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component consists of the amount of impairment related to loans that have been evaluated on an individual basis, and the general component consists of the amount of impairment related to loans that have been evaluated on a collective basis. Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent 12 quarters. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. Management utilizes an internal loan grading system and assigns each loan a grade of pass, special mention, substandard, or doubtful, which are more fully explained in Note 3. All loan relationships over 150 graded substandard and doubtful are evaluated for impairment. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured by a comparison of the loan's carrying value to the net present value of future cash flows using the loan's exiting rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected to solely from the collateral. All loans graded pass, special mention, substandard and doubtful not specifically evaluated for impairment are collectively evaluated for impairment by portfolio segment. To develop and document a systematic methodology for determining the portion of the allowance for loan losses for loans evaluated collectively, the Company has divided the loan portfolio into six portfolio segments, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. Those portfolio segments are discussed below: One-to-four family real estate : One-to-four family residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by first or second liens or mortgages on primary residences. We originate adjustable-rate and fixed-rate, one-to-four-family residential real estate loans for the construction, purchase or refinancing of a mortgage. These loans are collateralized by owner-occupied properties located in the Company's market area. Loans on one-to-four-family residential real estate are generally originated in amounts of up to for owner-occupied one-to-four family homes and up to for non-owner occupied homes. Mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance are normally required. Commercial real estate : Commercial real estate loans consist of loans to finance real estate purchases, refinancings, expansions and improvements to commercial properties. Commercial real estate loans are made to finance the purchases of real property, which generally consists of real estate with completed structures. These commercial real estate loans are secured by first liens on the real estate, which primarily include office buildings, farms, retail and mixed-use properties, churches, warehouses and restaurants located within the Company's market area. The Company's underwriting analysis includes credit verification, independent appraisals, a review of the borrower's financial condition, and a detailed analysis of the borrowers underlying cash flows. NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Commercial real estate loans are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Often these loans are made to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, and the repayment of these loans largely depends on the results of operations and management of these properties. Adverse economic conditions also affect the repayment ability to a greater extent than one-to-four real estate loans. These loans are typically originated in amounts of no more than of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property with an appropriate projected debt service coverage ratio. The Company's underwriting analysis includes considering the borrower's expertise and requires verification of the borrower's credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, independent appraisals, references and income projections for the property. The Company generally obtains personal guarantees on these loans. Multi-family real estate : Multi-family real estate loans generally have a maximum term of and are secured by apartment buildings in the Company's market area. The interest rates on these loans are generally fixed for an initial period five years. These loans are generally made in amounts of up to of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property with an appropriate projected debt service coverage ratio. The Company's underwriting analysis includes considering the borrower's expertise and requires verification of the borrower's credit history, income and financial statements, banking relationships, independent appraisals, references and income projections for the property. The Company generally obtains personal guarantees on these loans. Multi-family real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. Construction real estate : Construction loans consist of loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and, to a limited extent, loans to builders and commercial borrowers for owner-occupied projects. Loans to individuals for the construction of their residences typically run for up to 12 months and then convert to permanent loans. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one-to-four family loans. During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of owner-occupied single-family construction loans is . Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential loans. Construction loans generally are made for relatively short terms. However, to the extent construction loans are not made to owner-occupants of single-family homes, they are more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and the concentration of credit with a limited number of borrowers. Further, the nature of these loans is such that they are more difficult to evaluate and monitor. The risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value upon completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of owner-occupied single-family construction loans is . Commercial : Commercial business loans and lines of credit consist of loans to small- and medium-sized companies in the Company's market area. Commercial business loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. Interest rates on these loans are fixed rates. Primarily all of the Company's commercial loans are secured loans, along with a small amount of unsecured loans. The Company's underwriting analysis consists of a review of the financial statements of the borrower, the lending history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral, if any, and whether the loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Commercial business loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial business loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business, which makes them of higher risk than one-to-four family residential loans and the collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards. NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 of the property value less any other mortgages if the first loan is with the Bank. Home equity products in a secondary lien position are limited to of the property value less any superior liens. The Company uses the same underwriting standards for home equity lines-of-credit as it uses for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Home equity lines-of-credit provide for an initial draw period of up to , with monthly payments of of the outstanding balance or interest only payments calculated on the outstanding balance. At the end of the initial term, the line may be paid in full or restructured through our then current home equity program. To that extent, most of our consumer loans share the same level of risk as one-to-four family residential mortgages.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2026), (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than billion in nonconvertible debt and (iv) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our equity securities that are held by non-affiliates exceeds million as of June 30 of that year. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included herein, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as we remain an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. If we do so, we will prominently disclose this decision in the first periodic report following our decision, and such decision is irrevocable. As a filer under the JOBS Act, we will implement new accounting standards subject to the effective dates required for non-public entities. In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, which will change how the Company measures credit losses for most of its financial assets. This guidance is applicable to loans held for investment, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit, and held-to-maturity investment securities. The Company is required to use a new forward-looking current expected credit losses (CECL) model that is anticipated to result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses, the Company will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice but will recognize those credit losses as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. In addition, the ASU requires significantly more disclosure including information about credit quality by year of origination for most loans. Generally, the amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company has completed the process of developing credit models but is finalizing model implementation, implementation of internal controls, financial reporting process and corporate governance processes to comply with the new guidance. The Company will be adopting CECL effective January 1, 2023. Key project implementation activities for 2022 and 2021 focused on execution and implementation, processes and control, policies, disclosures, and data resolution. The company has been running parallel models and making adjustments in anticipation of adoption and cannot estimate the impact to the consolidated financial statements at this time.

The Company evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. The Company considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Additionally, the Company considers its intent to sell or whether it will be more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to the security's anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer's financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal Government sponsored agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer's financial condition. 

 ne of the unrealized losses for these securities have been recognized into net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 because the issuer's bonds are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or reset date. 
 
 Equity Securities 
 There were no equity securities as of December 31, 2021. There was equity security purchased during 2022 with a readily determinable fair value amount of held as of December 31, 2022 . We had redemptions of and net losses of were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Such loans should be subject to other alternative methods of evaluation to assure that the Bank's interest income is not materially overstated. The loans that were past due 90 days or more were accruing interest as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the fact that they were well secured and in the process of collection.

Troubled Debt Restructurings: Troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were and , respectively. The amount of impairment allocated to loans whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings was at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . The Company has committed additional amounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. There was loan modified as a troubled debt restructuring that occurred during the year December 31, 2021 and there were none during the year ended December 31, 2022 . The troubled debt restructuring resulted in charge offs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within twelve months of the modification during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 . In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company's internal underwriting policy. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated of small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), created by the CARES Act, which was signed into law in 2020. The CARES Act established the PPP through the SBA, which allowed us to lend money to small businesses to maintain employee payrolls through the COVID-19 crisis with guarantees from the SBA. Under this program, loan amounts may be forgiven if the borrower maintains employee payrolls and meet certain other requirements. PPP loans have a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of either two or . Such loans totaled and thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans are included in commercial loans. Credit Quality Indicators: The Company utilizes a grading system whereby all loans are assigned a grade based on the risk profile of each loan. Loan grades are determined based on an evaluation of relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. All loans, regardless of size, are analyzed and are given a grade based upon the management's assessment of the ability of borrowers to service their debts. The analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. NOTE 3 LOANS (Continued) The Company uses the following definitions for loan grades: Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. Substandard . Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans not meeting the criteria above are graded Pass. These loans are included within groups of homogeneous pools of loans based upon portfolio segment and class for estimation of the allowance for loan losses on a collective basis.

. Under the final rule, an eligible banking organization can opt out of the CBLR framework and revert back to the risk-weighting framework without restriction.

The Qualified Thrift Lender test requires at least of assets be maintained in housing-related finance and other specified areas. If this test is not met, limits are placed on growth, branching, new investments, FHLB advances and dividends, or the Bank must convert to a commercial bank charter. Management believes this test is met. However, during 2022, the Company was approved to make the election for Covered Savings Association (CSA) status. This election provides the Bank with the same rights and privileges as a national bank but the Bank retains its federal savings association charter. Dividend Restrictions The Company's principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year's net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. During 2023, the Bank could, without prior approval from its regulators, declare dividends of approximately plus any 2022 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.

NOTE 13 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Foreclosed Real Estate : Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. For appraisals where the value is or above for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the Loan Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics. In accordance to company policy, if the Company holds the property for over , an updated appraisal would be obtained in order to determine if the fair value amount should be adjusted.

There were transfers between levels during 2022 or 2021. Our state and municipal securities valuations are supported by analysis prepared by an independent third party. Their approach to determining fair value involves using recently executed transactions for similar securities and market quotations for similar securities. As these securities are not rated by the rating agencies and trading volumes are thin, it was determined that these were valued using Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's taxable municipal securities are discount rates and credit spreads that the market would require for taxable municipal securities with similar maturities and risk characteristics. Significant increases/(decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower/(higher) fair value measurement. Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are included in the table below as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands):

The Company has estimated the fair values of these assets using Level 3 inputs, specifically the appraised value of the collateral. Impaired loan balances represent those collateral dependent impaired loans where management has estimated the credit loss by comparing the loan s carrying value against the expected realizable fair value of the impaired loan for the amount of the credit loss. The Company had no Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , appraisals were used for the valuation technique. For the significant unobservable input, the appraisal discounts and the weighted average input of to were used. This is for the period ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As the Company is a non-accelerated filer, management s report is not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that permit the Company to provide only the management s report in this annual report
