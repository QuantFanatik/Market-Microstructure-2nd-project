Part I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Biglari Holdings Inc. is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including property and casualty insurance, licensing and media, restaurants, and oil and gas. The Company s largest operating subsidiaries are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. Biglari Holdings is founded and led by Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. 
 Biglari Holdings management system combines decentralized operations with centralized financial decision-making. Operating decisions for the various business units are made by their respective managers. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Mr. Biglari beneficially owns shares of the Company that represent approximately 66.3 of the economic interest and approximately 70.4 of the voting interest. 
 Restaurant Operations 
 The Company s restaurant operations are conducted through two subsidiaries: Steak n Shake Inc. Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin Corporation Western Sizzlin for a combined 545 units. As of December 31, 2022, Steak n Shake had 177 company-operated restaurants, 175 franchise partner units, and 154 traditional franchise units. Of the 177 company-operated units, 39 are currently closed but Steak n Shake intends to refranchise a majority of them. Western Sizzlin had 3 company-operated restaurants and 36 franchise units. 
 Founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois, on Route 66, Steak n Shake is a classic American brand serving premium burgers and milkshakes. Steak n Shake is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
 Founded in 1962 in Augusta, Georgia, Western Sizzlin is a steak and buffet concept serving signature steak dishes as well as other classic American menu items. Western Sizzlin also operates two other concepts: Great American Steak Buffet, and Wood Grill Buffet. Western Sizzlin is headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia. 
 
 The novel coronavirus COVID-19 ), declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, caused governments to impose restrictive measures to contain its spread. In response to COVID-19, our restaurants were required to close their dining rooms in the first quarter of 2020, and the majority of those dining rooms remained closed during 2020. Steak n Shake reopened the majority of dining rooms during 2021, and in doing so has implemented a self-service model. Our restaurant operations followed the guidance of health officials in determining the appropriate restrictions to put in place for each restaurant. 
 Company-Operated Restaurants 
 A typical company-operated restaurant management team consists of a general manager, a restaurant manager, and other managers, depending on the sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant s general manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of his or her unit. Restaurant operations obtain food products and supplies from independent national distributors. Purchases are centrally negotiated to ensure uniformity in product quality. 
 
 Franchise Partner Restaurants 
 Steak n Shake offers a franchise partner program to transition company-operated restaurants to franchise partnerships. The franchise agreement stipulates that the franchisee make an upfront investment totaling ten thousand dollars. Steak n Shake, as the franchisor, assesses a fee of up to 15 of sales as well as 50 of profits. Potential franchise partners are screened based on entrepreneurial attitude and ability, but they become franchise partners based on achievement. Each must meet the gold standard in service. Franchise partners are single-unit owner-operators. 
 
 Traditional Franchise Restaurants 
 Restaurant operations traditional franchising program extends the brands to areas in which there are no current development plans for company stores. The expansion plans include seeking qualified new franchisees and expanding relationships with current franchisees. Restaurant operations typically seek franchisees with both the financial resources necessary to fund successful development and significant experience in the restaurant/retail business. Both restaurant chains assist franchisees with the development and ongoing operation of their restaurants. In addition, personnel assist franchisees with site selection, approve restaurant sites, and provide prototype plans, construction support, and specifications. Restaurant operations staff provides both on-site and off-site instruction to franchise restaurant management and associates.

International 
 We have a corporate office in Monaco and an international organization with personnel in various functions to support our international business. Similar to our traditional domestic franchise agreements, a typical international franchise development agreement includes development and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. 
 
 Competition 
 The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional, and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety, and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. 
 Government Regulations 
 The Company is subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws affecting its restaurant operations. Each of the restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, i.e., health, sanitation, safety, and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. 
 
 Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees, e.g., minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment tax, health insurance, and workers compensation. Federal, state, and local government agencies have established regulations requiring that we disclose nutritional information. 
 Trademark and Licenses 
 The name and reputation of Steak n Shake is a material asset, and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations. 
 Insurance Business 
 Biglari Holdings insurance activities are conducted through two insurance entities, First Guard Insurance Company and its affiliated agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively First Guard ), and Southern Pioneer Property Casualty Insurance Company and its affiliated agency, Southern Pioneer Insurance Agency, Inc. (collectively Southern Pioneer ). Our insurance businesses provide insurance of property and casualty. 
 
 The insurance business is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. Insurers based in the United States are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. First Guard and Southern Pioneer operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. The primary focus of regulation is to ensure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions, and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell, and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance industry. 
 
 First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. The commercial truck insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized companies and by small regional insurers. First Guard s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost insurer. First Guard uses its own claim staff to manage claims. Seasonal variations in First Guard s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims. First Guard is headquartered in Venice, Florida. 
 
 Southern Pioneer underwrites garage liability and commercial property as well as homeowners and dwelling fire insurance on an admitted basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide, primarily through insurance agents. Southern Pioneer competes with large companies and local insurers. Southern Pioneer is headquartered in Jonesboro, Arkansas. 
 
 Biglari Holdings insurance operations may be affected by extraordinary weather conditions or other factors, any of which may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims.

Oil and Gas Business 
 The Company's oil and gas operations are conducted through two entities, Southern Oil Company Southern Oil and Abraxas Petroleum Corporation Abraxas Petroleum ). Southern Oil primarily operates oil and natural gas properties offshore in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Abraxas Petroleum operates oil and natural gas wells in the Permian Basin. 
 
 On September 14, 2022, the Company purchased Series A Preferred Stock (the Preferred Shares of Abraxas Petroleum for a purchase price of 80 million. On October 26, 2022, the Company exchanged the Preferred Shares for 90 of the outstanding common stock of Abraxas Petroleum. 
 
 The oil and gas industry is fundamentally a commodity business. Southern Oil s and Abraxas Petroleum s operations and earnings, therefore, may be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. The COVID-19 pandemic caused oil demand to decrease significantly during the second and third quarters of 2020, which created oversupplied markets and lower commodity prices and margins. In response, the Company cut production and expenses in its oil and natural gas business during 2020. However, the significant increase in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2021 and 2022 as compared to 2020 resulting from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of normal economic activity, and the resulting improvement in supply and demand fundamentals caused Southern Oil to return to full production during 2021 and 2022. Biglari Holdings oil and gas operations compete with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies. In addition, our companies are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the oil and gas business, including a wide range of local, state, and federal regulations. 
 
 Southern Oil is headquartered in Madisonville, Louisiana, and Abraxas Petroleum is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. 
 Brand Licensing Business 
 Maxim s business lies principally in brand licensing. Maxim is headquartered in New York, New York. 
 Maxim competes for licensing business with other companies. The nature of the licensing business is predicated on projects that materialize with irregularity. In addition, publishing is a highly competitive business. 
 Maxim products are marketed under various registered brand names, including, but not limited to, MAXIM and Maxim . 
 Investments 
 The Company and its subsidiaries have invested in The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P. (collectively, the investment partnerships ). The investment partnerships operate as private investment funds. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the investments was 383.0 million. These investments are subject to a rolling five-year lock-up period under the terms of the respective partnership agreements. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 2,559 persons. When hiring personnel, we do not consider circumstances of birth, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other factor unrelated to talent. The factor of prime importance to us, talent, is invariably found across a wide spectrum of humanity. We seek to associate with people of high character and competence.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as we, us, our, or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in their business operations, which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. 
 Risks relating to Biglari Holdings 
 We are dependent on our Chairman and CEO. 
 Our success depends on the services of Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. If for any reason the services of Mr. Biglari were to become unavailable, a material adverse effect on our business could occur. 
 Sardar Biglari, Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns over 50 of our outstanding shares of common stock, enabling Mr. Biglari to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval. 
 Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, the amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws, and other significant transactions. In addition, Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. This control position may conflict with the interests of some or all of the Company s passive shareholders, and reduce the possibility of a merger proposal, tender offer, or proxy contest for the removal of directors. 
 We are a controlled company within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and thus can rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. 
 Because Mr. Biglari beneficially owns more than 50 of the Company s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a controlled company pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee requirements. The Company does not have a governance and nominating committee. 
 Biglari Holdings access to capital is subject to restrictions that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy its cash requirements. 
 We are a holding company and are largely dependent upon dividends and other sources of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our needs. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Furthermore, as a result of our substantial investments in The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P., investment partnerships controlled by Mr. Biglari, our access to capital is restricted by the terms of their respective partnership agreements. There is also a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships. 
 Competition and technology may result in lower earnings. 
 Our operating businesses face intense competition within their markets, and many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of their competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results may decline in the future. We also highlight certain competitive risks in the sections below. 
 Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings. 
 Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deterioration of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. 
 
 Our operating businesses face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets. 
 There is no assurance that our international operations will remain profitable. Our international operations are subject to all of the risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks, varying substantially country by country. These include, inter alia , international economic and political conditions, corruption, terrorism, social and ethnic unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, differing cultures, and consumer preferences. 
 
 In addition, we may become subject to foreign governmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and 
 4 

Table of Contents 

applicable local laws. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition. 
 
 Epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses and investments. 
 The outbreak of COVID-19 adversely affected our operations and investments, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks may do the same. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. 
 Potential changes in laws or regulations may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. 
 In prior years, bills have been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such common stock were part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these bills have not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introduced in Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges. 
 Litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. 
 We are or may be from time to time a party to various legal actions, investigations, and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies, or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including those related to our investment activities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify, and the cost to defend future proceedings may be significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any allegation regarding the Company, our business, or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcome of routine legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannot assure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact our business and results of operations for the period after these matters are completed or otherwise resolved. 
 Risks Relating to Our Restaurant Operations 
 Our restaurant operations face intense competition from a wide range of industry participants. 
 The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional, and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety, and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect the restaurant industry include, but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness. 
 Changes in economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations. 
 Our restaurant operations are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has been affected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional, and local economic conditions, declines in employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Declines in consumer restaurant spending could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomic disruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing for our franchisees expansions and operations. 
 Fluctuations in commodity and energy prices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business. 
 The cost, availability, and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food are subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant business costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commodity markets, inflation, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of 
 5 

Table of Contents 

ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu offerings, and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Adverse weather conditions or losses due to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance. 
 Property damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact sales in several ways. Many of Steak n Shake s and Western Sizzlin s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeast portions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions. During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales and operating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests to visit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees. 
 
 Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our restaurant business. 
 Our restaurant business depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality staff. Maintaining adequate staffing in our restaurants requires workforce planning and knowledge of the relevant labor market. The market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive, and we must provide competitive wages, benefits, and workplace conditions. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in recruiting and retaining associates in various locations. A shortage of qualified candidates, failure to recruit and retain new associates in a timely manner, or higher than expected turnover levels could all affect our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives. 
 We are subject to health, employment, environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could expose us to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits. 
 We are subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary for compliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputation could be harmed accordingly. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits. 
 The development and construction of restaurants is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failure to obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. 
 Restaurant operations are also subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products. The operation of the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchise systems is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states, and to rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationships with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdiction, or to obtain required government approvals, could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Further national, state, and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage or increases in minimum wage rates, could adversely affect our business. 
 Risks Relating to Our Investment Activities 
 The majority of our investment activities are conducted through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr. Biglari. 
 Our investment activities are conducted mainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made by the Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal of funds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidating these investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, the capital we have invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion of its value, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships in the future. 
 We have a services agreement with Biglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships Biglari Capital ), and Biglari Enterprises LLC (collectively, the Biglari Entities ), in which the Company pays a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for business and administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paid will be commensurate with the benefits received.

The incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled with respect to our investments under the terms of the respective partnership agreements is equal to 25 of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6 hurdle rate over the previous high-water mark. 
 
 Our investments may be concentrated, and fair values are subject to a loss in value. 
 The majority of our investments are held through the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments may be largely concentrated in the common stocks of a few investees. A significant decline in the values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings. 
 We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
 We run the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies. 
 To avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 2,500 employees, along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludes insurance companies from the definition of investment company. Because we monitor the value of our investments and structure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. 
 Risks Relating to Our Insurance Business 
 Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. 
 Our results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses. 
 Our insurance business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our insurance business faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, and other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events through reinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so. 
 Our insurance business is subject to extensive existing state, local, and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues. 
 Our insurance business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be held. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters, or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business, may adversely impact its results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Brand Licensing Business 
 Licensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may be difficult to maintain. 
 Maxim s success depends to a significant degree upon licensing agreements. These licensing agreements mature from time to time, and we may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected. 
 Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas Business 
 Our oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices. 
 The single largest variable that affects our oil and gas results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our oil and gas business s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Our oil and gas business is subject to disruption by factors beyond its control. 
 Any disruption of the extractive business of either of our oil and gas subsidiaries would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our oil and gas operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond their control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. 
 Our oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations. 
 Our oil and gas operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory, and political environments. Litigation or changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1, Business and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, set forth above. 

Our Management Discussion and Analysis generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items. Discussions of 2020 items can be found in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022. 
 
 Investment gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 were mainly derived from our investments in equity securities and included unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are generally meaningless for analytical purposes in understanding our reported quarterly and annual results. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 
 Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We operate on a decentralized management structure. The business segment data (Note 17 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.

Restaurant operations for 2022, 2021, and 2020 are summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Revenue Net sales 149,184 187,913 306,577 Franchise partner fees 63,853 55,641 22,213 Franchise royalties and fees 19,678 21,736 18,794 Other revenue 8,853 6,000 3,082 Total revenue 241,568 271,290 350,666 Restaurant cost of sales Cost of food 44,461 29.8 55,315 29.4 88,698 28.9 Restaurant operating costs 79,921 53.6 92,543 49.2 137,574 44.9 Occupancy costs 15,882 10.6 19,633 10.4 20,383 6.6 Total cost of sales 140,264 167,491 246,655 Selling, general and administrative General and administrative 40,206 16.6 39,940 14.7 35,922 10.2 Marketing 13,921 5.8 13,923 5.1 21,507 6.1 Other expenses (income) (2,294) (0.9) 3,323 1.2 2,972 0.8 Total selling, general and administrative 51,833 21.5 57,186 21.1 60,401 17.2 Impairments 3,520 1.5 4,635 1.7 23,646 6.7 Depreciation and amortization 27,496 11.4 21,484 7.9 19,042 5.4 Interest on finance leases and obligations 5,493 6,039 6,274 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 12,962 14,455 (5,352) Income tax expense (benefit) 3,579 3,220 (391) Contribution to net earnings 9,383 11,235 (4,961) 
 Cost of food, restaurant operating costs, and occupancy costs are expressed as a percentage of net sales. 
 General and administrative, marketing, other expenses, impairments, and depreciation and amortization are expressed as a percentage of total revenue. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our restaurant operations and financial results. Our restaurants were required to close their dining rooms during the first quarter of 2020. The majority of Steak n Shake s dining rooms remained closed through the end of 2020 but reopened during 2021, and in doing so implemented a self-service model. 
 
 Net sales during 2022 were 149,184 as compared to 187,913 during 2021. The decrease in revenue of company-owned restaurants is primarily due to the shift of company units to franchise partner units. For company-operated units, sales to the end customer are recorded as revenue generated by the Company, but for franchise partner units, only our share of the restaurant's profits, along with certain fees, are recorded as revenue. Because we derive most of our revenue from our share of the profits, revenue will continue to decline as we transition from company-operated units to franchise partner units.

Table of Contents 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

To better convey the underlying economics of the franchise partnership model, the table below shows the average unit sales, the cost of food, and the labor costs of franchise partners. The average was based on 137 comparable franchise partner units, out of a total of 175. To be included as a comparable franchise partner unit, a unit had to be operated by a franchise partner for all of 2022, and had to be open in 2021 as either a company-operated or a franchise partner unit. 
 
 2022 2021 Net sales 1,819 1,595 Cost of food 502 27.6 448 28.1 Labor costs 500 27.5 435 27.3 
 
 Our franchise partner fees were 63,853 during 2022 as compared to 55,641 during 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were 175 franchise partner units as compared to 159 franchise partner units as of December 31, 2021. Included in franchise partner fees were 20,426 and 15,483 of rental income during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Franchise partners rent buildings and equipment from Steak n Shake. 
 
 The franchise royalties and fees generated by the traditional franchising business were 19,678 during 2022 as compared to 21,736 during 2021. The decrease in franchise royalties and fees was primarily due to the closing of certain traditional franchise stores. There were 190 traditional units open on December 31, 2022, as compared to 216 units open on December 31, 2021. 
 
 Other revenue in 2022 was 8,853 as compared to 6,000 in 2021. The increase was primarily a result of gift card breakage, as our restaurants have seen fewer gift card redemptions since the onset of the pandemic. 
 
 The cost of food at company-operated units in 2022 was 44,461, or 29.8 of net sales as compared to 55,315, or 29.4 of net sales in 2021. The decreases in the cost of food and operating costs are mainly attributable to the transitioning of company-operated units to franchise partner units. The cost of food expressed as a percentage of net sales remained consistent with 2021. 
 
 The operating costs at company-operated restaurants during 2022 were 79,921, or 53.6 of net sales as compared to 92,543, or 49.2 of net sales in 2021. As we transition to franchise partner units, the remaining company-operated units generate lower average unit volumes and correspondingly higher operating costs (including higher wages) as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses during 2022 were 51,833, or 21.5 of total revenue as compared to 57,186, or 21.1 of total revenue during 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased during 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily because of lower professional costs. 
 
 Asset impairments decreased 1,115 during 2022 as compared to 2021. Higher asset impairments were recorded in 2021 primarily because a large number of underperforming stores were affected by the pandemic. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6,012 during 2022 as compared to 2021. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures in 2021. 
 
 Interest on obligations under leases was 5,493 during 2022 versus 6,039 during 2021. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the maturity and retirement of lease obligations. 
 
 Insurance 
 We view our insurance businesses as possessing two activities: underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, whereas investing decisions are the responsibility of our Chairman and CEO, Sardar Biglari. Our business units are operated under separate local management. Biglari Holdings insurance operations consist of First Guard and Southern Pioneer.

Underwriting results of our insurance operations are summarized below. 
 
 2022 2021 2020 Underwriting gain (loss) attributable to: First Guard 6,578 10,573 9,379 Southern Pioneer (1,277) 1,744 620 Pre-tax underwriting gain 5,301 12,317 9,999 Income tax expense 1,113 2,587 2,100 Net underwriting gain 4,188 9,730 7,899

 Insurance premiums and other on the consolidated statement of earnings includes premiums earned, investment income, other income, and commissions. Commissions are in other income in the above table. 
 First Guard 
 
 First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. First Guard s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost insurer. A summary of First Guard s underwriting results follows. 
 2022 2021 2020 Amount Amount Amount Premiums earned 35,914 100.0 33,521 100.0 30,210 100.0 Insurance losses 22,299 62.1 16,338 48.7 14,031 46.5 Underwriting expenses 7,037 19.6 6,610 19.7 6,800 22.5 Total losses and expenses 29,336 81.7 22,948 68.4 20,831 69.0 Pre-tax underwriting gain 6,578 10,573 9,379 
 
 First Guard s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 62.1 during 2022 as compared to 48.7 during 2021. First Guard s underwriting results in 2022 were in line with its historical performance despite cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in 2022. However, 2021 was an abnormally favorable year with low claim frequency despite a return to pre-pandemic traffic patterns.

Southern Pioneer 
 
 Southern Pioneer underwrites garage liability and commercial property insurance, as well as homeowners and dwelling fire insurance. The financial results for Southern Pioneer are from the date of acquisition, March 9, 2020. A summary of Southern Pioneer s underwriting results follows. 
 2022 2021 2020 Amount Amount Amount Premiums earned 24,035 100.0 21,890 100.0 19,010 100.0 Insurance losses 14,888 61.9 11,311 51.7 10,797 56.8 Underwriting expenses 10,424 43.4 8,835 40.4 7,593 39.9 Total losses and expenses 25,312 105.3 20,146 92.1 18,390 96.7 Pre-tax underwriting gain (loss) (1,277) 1,744 620 

Southern Pioneer s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned was 61.9 during 2022 as compared to 51.7 during 2021. Southern Pioneer s 2022 performance was primarily attributable to higher claim frequency and severity (mainly related to adverse weather) in several niche lines.

Oil and Gas 
 Biglari Holdings oil and gas operations consist of Southern Oil and Abraxas Petroleum. 
 Southern Oil 
 Southern Oil primarily operates oil and natural gas properties offshore in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Earnings for Southern Oil are summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Oil and gas revenue 46,091 33,004 26,255 Oil and gas production costs 13,355 10,470 8,700 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion 5,503 8,073 12,527 General and administrative expenses 2,694 4,748 3,010 Earnings before income taxes 24,539 9,713 2,018 Income tax expense 5,946 2,185 128 Contribution to net earnings 18,593 7,528 1,890 
 
 Our oil and gas business is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Demand for petroleum grew in 2022, with our financial results benefiting from stronger prices and margins. The average West Texas Intermediate price per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately 94.53 as compared to approximately 68.17 for the year ended December 31, 2021. It is expected that the prices of oil and gas commodities will remain volatile, which will be reflected in our financial results. Depreciation, depletion, and accretion expense during 2022 decreased 2,570 as compared to 2021, primarily due to temporarily shutting in producing wells. 
 Abraxas Petroleum 
 Abraxas Petroleum operates oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin. Earnings for Abraxas Petroleum from the date of acquisition, September 14, 2022, are summarized below. 
 
 2022 Oil and gas revenue 11,455 Oil and gas production costs 4,487 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion 2,510 General and administrative expenses 3,806 Earnings before income taxes 652 Income tax expense 154 Contribution to net earnings 498

Brand Licensing 
 Maxim s business lies principally in licensing and media. Earnings of operations are summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Licensing and media revenue 4,577 3,203 4,083 Licensing and media cost 2,695 2,275 2,156 General and administrative expenses 122 114 143 Earnings before income taxes 1,760 814 1,784 Income tax expense 447 (1,550) 410 Contribution to net earnings 1,313 2,364 1,374 
 We acquired Maxim with the idea of transforming its business model. The magazine developed the Maxim brand, a franchise we are utilizing to generate nonmagazine revenue, notably through licensing, a cash-generating business related to consumer products, services, and events. 
 
 Investment Gains and Investment Partnership Gains 
 
 Investment losses were 3,393 2,682 net of tax) in 2022 as compared to investment gains of 6,401 4,832 net of tax) in 2021. Investment gains in 2021 included a gain from the sale of real estate of 5,047 3,785 net of tax). Dividends earned on investments are reported as investment income by our insurance companies. We consider investment income as a component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. 
 
 Earnings from our investments in partnerships are summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Investment partnership gains (losses) (75,953) 10,953 (43,032) Tax expense (benefit) (18,992) 2,054 (10,526) Contribution to net earnings (56,961) 8,899 (32,506) 
 Investment partnership gains include gains/losses from changes in the market values of underlying investments and dividends earned by the partnerships. Dividend income has a lower effective tax rate than income from capital gains. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. 
 The investment partnerships hold the Company s common stock as investments. The Company s pro-rata share of its common stock held by the investment partnerships is recorded as treasury stock even though these shares are legally outstanding. Gains and losses on Company common stock included in the earnings of the partnerships are eliminated in the Company s consolidated financial results. 
 Investment gains and losses in 2022 and 2021 were mainly derived from our investments in equity securities and included unrealized gains and losses from market price changes during the period. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are generally meaningless for analytical purposes in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.

Interest Expense 
 The Company s interest expense is summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense on notes payable and other borrowings (399) (1,121) (9,262) Tax benefit (94) (280) (2,322) Interest expense net of tax (305) (841) (6,940) 
 The Company paid Steak n Shake s outstanding credit facility in full in February 2021. On September 13, 2022, Biglari Holdings entered into a line of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to 30,000. The balance on the line of credit was 10,000 on December 31, 2022. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The consolidated income tax benefit was 10,722 in 2022 versus an expense of 6,789 in 2021. The change in income tax expense was primarily due to a tax benefit of 18,992 for investment partnership losses in 2022. 
 
 Corporate and Other 
 Corporate expenses exclude the activities of the restaurant, insurance, brand licensing, and oil and gas businesses. Corporate and other net losses for 2022 remained consistent with the preceding year. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Our consolidated shareholders equity on December 31, 2022, was 546,966, a decrease of 40,730 as compared to the December 31, 2021 balance. The decrease in shareholders equity was primarily due to a net loss of 32,018 and an increase in treasury stock of 7,829. 
 Consolidated cash and investments are summarized below. 
 December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents 37,467 42,349 Investments 69,466 83,061 Fair value of interest in investment partnerships 383,004 474,201 Total cash and investments 489,937 599,611 Less: portion of Company stock held by investment partnerships (227,210) (223,802) Carrying value of cash and investments on balance sheet 262,727 375,809 
 Unrealized gains/losses of Biglari Holdings stock held by the investment partnerships are eliminated in the Company s consolidated financial results. 
 Liquidity 
 Our balance sheet continues to maintain significant liquidity. Consolidated cash flow activities are summarized below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities 127,825 228,767 117,556 Net cash used in investing activities (136,605) (58,525) (129,487) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,860 (156,157) (29,109) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 38 (64) 10 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (4,882) 14,021 (41,030)

Table of Contents 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

In 2022, cash from operating activities decreased by 100,942 as compared to 2021. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in distributions from investment partnerships from 180,170 in 2021 to 70,700 in 2022. The distributions during 2022 were primarily used to acquire Abraxas Petroleum, and the distributions during 2021 were primarily used to repay Steak n Shake s term loan. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased during 2022 by 78,080 as compared to 2021. The change was primarily due to the acquisition of Abraxas Petroleum of 58,274, net of cash acquired, as well as purchases of limited partner interests of 48,570 during 2022. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities of 3,860 during 2022 was primarily because of the 10,000 draw on the Company s line of credit. Cash used in financing activities of 156,157 during 2021 was primarily attributable to the repayment of Steak n Shake s outstanding balance of its term debt. 
 
 We intend to meet the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries, principally through cash flows generated from operations and cash on hand. We continually review available financing alternatives. 
 
 Biglari Holdings Line of Credit 
 On September 13, 2022, Biglari Holdings entered into a line of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to 30,000. The line of credit will be available on a revolving basis until September 12, 2024. The line of credit includes customary covenants, as well as financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants. The balance of the line of credit on December 31, 2022, was 10,000. Our interest rate was 6.53 on December 31, 2022, which is based on the 30-day Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 2.728 . 
 
 Steak n Shake Credit Facility 
 On March 19, 2014, Steak n Shake and its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement that provided for a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 220,000. The term loan was scheduled to mature on March 19, 2021. The Company repaid Steak n Shake s outstanding balance in full on February 19, 2021. 
 Western Sizzlin Revolver 
 Western Sizzlin s available line of credit is 500. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Western Sizzlin had no debt outstanding under its revolver. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2022, follows. 
 
 Consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Biglari Holdings Inc. and the wholly owned subsidiaries of Biglari Holdings Inc. The analysis as to whether to consolidate an entity is subject to a significant amount of judgment. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Our interests in the investment partnerships are accounted for as equity method investments because of our retained limited partner interest in the investment partnerships. The Company records gains from the investment partnerships (inclusive of the investment partnerships unrealized gains and losses on their securities) in the consolidated statement of earnings based on our proportional ownership interest in the investment partnerships. 
 Impairment of Restaurant Long-lived Assets 
 We review company-operated restaurants for impairment on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Assets included in the impairment assessment generally consist of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements directly associated with an individual restaurant as well as any related finance or operating lease assets. We test for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the total estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value, and a loss is recognized in earnings. Determining the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset requires significant judgment regarding future performance of the asset, fair market value if the asset were to be sold, and other financial and economic assumptions.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where expenditure is required for recompletion. We estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves in accordance with the guidelines established by the SEC. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. 
 Income Taxes 
 We record deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are based on differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record deferred tax assets to the extent we believe there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior to their expiration. To the extent deferred tax assets are unable to be utilized, we would record a valuation allowance against the unrealizable amount and record that amount as a charge against earnings. Due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate applicable to tax differences arising from reversal in the future. We must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currently recorded. 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 We evaluate goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Goodwill impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The valuation methodology and underlying financial information included in our determination of fair value require significant managerial judgment. Based on a review of the qualitative factors, if we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we may bypass the quantitative impairment test. We may also elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit or intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test instead. 
 
 Leases 
 We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from, or to direct the use of, such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets are recognized at the commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense on the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Biglari Holdings Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Biglari Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Emphasis of a Matter 
 As discussed in Note 4 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company and its subsidiaries have invested in investment partnerships in the form of limited partnership interests. These investment partnerships represent related parties, and such investments are subject to a rolling five-year lock up period under the terms of the respective partnership agreements for the investment partnerships. The value of these investments reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 totals 155,794,000 and 250,399,000, respectively. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Company-operated restaurants and associated long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment may have occurred. The Company s evaluation of potential impairment of long-lived assets involves the comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group, generally an individual restaurant, over the expected remaining useful life of that asset group, to the respective carrying amount. The Company also applied a market analysis for certain properties. The Company s undiscounted future cash flows analysis requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to future revenues, labor costs and planned operating periods. To the extent that the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the related assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the related assets using a discounted cash flow model to assess the amount of any impairment. 
 We identified the impairment of company-operated restaurant long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the estimates and assumptions required by management to evaluate the potential impairment of these asset groups. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of certain assumptions, in management s undiscounted and discounted future cash flows analyses, including revenue growth, food costs, labor costs, and planned operating periods of restaurants. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows analysis and the assessment of the expected remaining holding period included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s evaluation of the recoverability of long-lived assets, including those over revenue, food costs, labor costs and the planned operating period for the store. 
 We evaluated the undiscounted future cash flows analysis, including estimates of revenue growth, labor costs and planned operating periods of restaurants by (1) evaluating the underlying source information and assumptions used by management (2) performing sensitivity analyses and (3) testing the mathematical accuracy of the undiscounted future cash flows analysis. 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of management s undiscounted future cash flows analysis by comparing management s projections to the Company s historical results and available market data. 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for the properties where management applied a market analysis, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and used comparable current market data to develop a range of independent estimates and compare our estimates to those used by management. 
 We evaluated the discount rates used by management in the performance of discounted cash flow analyses by testing management s calculation, performing sensitivity analyses, comparing components to external market information as applicable, and assessed the mathematical accuracy of the Company s calculations of potential impairment.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Biglari Holdings Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Biglari Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an emphasis of a matter paragraph relating to the Company s investment in related party investment partnerships. 
 
 As described in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Abraxas Petroleum, which was acquired on September 14, 2022, and whose financial statements constitute approximately 9.8 of total assets, 3.1 of revenues, and 2.5 of net earnings of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Abraxas Petroleum. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 to years for buildings and land improvements, and to years for equipment). Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the related leases. Interest costs associated with the construction of new restaurants are capitalized. Major improvements are also capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We review our long-lived restaurant assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For purposes of this assessment, assets are evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual restaurant level. Assets included in the impairment assessment generally consist of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements directly associated with an individual restaurant as well as any related finance or operating lease assets. If the future undiscounted cash flows of an asset are less than the recorded value, an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

 We evaluate goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Goodwill impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. GAAP allows entities testing for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. For our 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing, we elected to perform qualitative assessments for our reporting units. No indicators of impairment were noted. If a quantitative test were to be utilized for our reporting units, it would estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to its carrying value. To the extent the fair value was in excess of the carrying value, no impairment would be recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of our reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value. In performing the quantitative test of goodwill, fair value would be determined based on a calculation that gives consideration to an income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method and to a market approach using the market comparable and market transaction methods. impairment was recorded for our reporting units in 2022 and 2021. The fair value of certain of Steak n Shake s reporting units declined in 2020, and an impairment to goodwill of was recorded in 2020. An impairment of Western Sizzlin s goodwill may be necessary if a significant decline in its franchise units occurs.

 Unaudited required supplemental information 
 Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include an amount for reported losses and an amount for losses incurred but not reported. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that, once reported, are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Such reserves are necessarily based upon estimates, and while management, based on past experience, believes that the amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts provided. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. The methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting reserves are continually reviewed, and any adjustments are reflected in operations annually. 
 First Guard 
 
 First Guard s claim liabilities predominately relate to commercial truck claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using historical claims data and other data as necessary to determine our best estimate, with an annual review by certified actuaries and certified public accountants. Claim liabilities include average case, case development, and IBNR estimates.

Adjustments to the Company s unrecognized tax benefit for gross increases for the current period tax position, gross decreases for prior period tax positions, and the lapse of statutes of limitations during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not significant. 
 We file income tax returns which are periodically audited by various foreign, federal, state, and local jurisdictions.

 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows presented in the following table was computed using the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices, the costs in effect at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and a percent discount factor. The Company cautions that actual future net cash flows may vary considerably from these estimates. Although the Company s estimates of total proved reserves, development costs, and production rates were based on the best available information, the development and production of the crude oil and natural gas reserves may not occur in the periods assumed. Actual prices realized, costs incurred, and production quantities may vary significantly from those used. Therefore, the estimated future net cash flow computations should not be considered to represent the Company s estimate of the expected revenues or the current value of proved reserves.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of Biglari Holdings Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 We are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of Abraxas Petroleum and integrating Abraxas Petroleum into our internal control over financial reporting.

February 24, 2023 Mr. Sardar Biglari Biglari Holdings, Inc. 19100 Ridgewood Parkway, Suite 1200 San Antonio, Texas 78259 Dear Mr. Biglari: In accordance with your request, we have estimated the proved reserves and future revenue, as of December 31, 2022, to the combined interests of Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (Abraxas) and Southern Oil of Louisiana LLC (SOLA) (collectively referred to herein as Abraxas-SOLA in certain oil and gas properties located onshore and offshore Louisiana and Texas. Abraxas and SOLA are both subsidiaries of Biglari Holdings Inc. (Biglari). We completed our evaluation on or about the date of this letter. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimated in this report constitute all of the proved reserves owned by Abraxas-SOLA. The estimates in this report have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. Definitions are presented immediately following this letter. This report has been prepared for Biglari's use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. We estimate the net reserves and future net revenue to the Abraxas-SOLA interest in these properties, as of December 31, 2022, to be: Net Reserves Future Net Revenue (M Oil NGL Gas Present Worth Category (MBBL) (MBBL) (MMCF) Total at 10 Proved Developed Producing 4,019.3 1,508.0 22,988.9 276,421.4 168,445.8 Proved Developed Non-Producing 487.6 0.0 9,143.4 61,196.6 43,745.6 Proved Undeveloped 464.4 0.0 8,116.7 65,233.9 45,213.3 Total Proved 4,971.3 1,508.0 40,249.1 402,851.9 257,404.7 Totals may not add because of rounding. The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBBL); a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. Gas volumes are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty; reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. As requested, probable and possible reserves that exist for these properties have not been included. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. This report does not include any value that could be attributed to interests in undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. Gross revenue is Abraxas-SOLA's share of the gross (100 percent) revenue from the properties prior to any deductions. Future net revenue is after deductions for Abraxas-SOLA's share of production taxes, ad valorem taxes, capital costs, abandonment costs, and operating expenses but before consideration of any income taxes. The future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent to determine its present worth, which is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of money. Future net revenue presented in this report, whether discounted or undiscounted, should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. 

Prices used in this report are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December 2022. For oil and NGL volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate spot price of 94.14 per barrel is adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of 6.357 per MMBTU is adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 94.20 per barrel of oil, 27.99 per barrel of NGL, and 5.412 per MCF of gas. Operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of Abraxas and SOLA. These costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the district and field levels. Operating costs have been divided into field-level costs, per- well costs, and per-unit-of-production costs. Headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of Abraxas and SOLA are included to the extent that they are covered under joint operating agreements for the operated properties. For all properties, headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of Biglari are not included. Operating costs are not escalated for inflation. Capital costs used in this report were provided by SOLA and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment. Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review of the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs used in this report are Abraxas' and SOLA's estimates of the costs to abandon the wells, platforms, and production facilities, net of any salvage value. Capital costs and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation. For the purposes of this report, we did not perform any field inspection of the properties, nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and facilities. We have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties; therefore, our estimates do not include any costs due to such possible liability. We have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the Abraxas and SOLA interests. Therefore, our estimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances; our projections are based on Abraxas and SOLA receiving their net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production. Additionally, we have made no specific investigation of any firm transportation contracts that may be in place for these properties; our estimates of future revenue include the effects of such contracts only to the extent that the associated fees are accounted for in the historical field- and lease-level accounting statements. The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible; probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, our estimates are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Abraxas and SOLA, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that our projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing this report. For the purposes of this report, we used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership 

interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using deterministic methods; these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis, analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. A substantial portion of these reserves are for behind-pipe zones, non- producing zones, and undeveloped locations; such reserves are based on estimates of reservoir volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. The data used in our estimates were obtained from Abraxas, SOLA, public data sources, and the nonconfidential files of Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. (NSAI) and were accepted as accurate. Supporting work data are on file in our office. We have not examined the titles to the properties or independently confirmed the actual degree or type of interest owned. The technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. Michael B. Begland, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1993 and has over 8 years of prior industry experience. Michelle F. Herrera, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 2013 and has over 10 years of prior industry experience. We are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; we do not own an interest in these properties nor are we employed on a contingent basis.

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 1 of 6 The following definitions are set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a). Also included is supplemental information from (1) the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, (2) the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, and (3) the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. (1) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. (2) Analogous reservoir. Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: (i) Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); (ii) Same environment of deposition; (iii) Similar geological structure; and (iv) Same drive mechanism. Instruction to paragraph (a)(2): Reservoir properties must, in the aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest. (3) Bitumen. Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. (4) Condensate. Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. (5) Deterministic estimate. The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. (6) Developed oil and gas reserves. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Supplemental definitions from the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System: Developed Producing Reserves Expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved recovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. Developed Non-Producing Reserves Shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. (7) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to: (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves. (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 2 of 6 (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems. (iv) Provide improved recovery systems. (8) Development project. A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. (9) Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. (10) Economically producible. The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. (11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date. (12) Exploration costs. Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory- type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are: (i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or G G costs. (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records. (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions. (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells. (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. (13) Exploratory well. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. (14) Extension well. An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. (15) Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. (16) Oil and gas producing activities. (i) Oil and gas producing activities include: (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations; (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties; (C) The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as: (1) Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and (2) Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 3 of 6 (D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction. Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): The oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a terminal point , which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. If unusual physical or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as: a. The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal; and b. In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading, the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas. Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): For purposes of this paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered. (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include: (A) Transporting, refining, or marketing oil and gas; (B) Processing of produced oil, gas, or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production; (C) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil, gas, or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted; or (D) Production of geothermal steam. (17) Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. (i) When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. (iv) The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects. (v) Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations. (18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. (i) When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 4 of 6 (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. (iv) See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section. (19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. (20) Production costs. (i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are: (A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. (B) Repairs and maintenance. (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. (E) Severance taxes. (ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. (21) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. (22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 5 of 6 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. (23) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves. (24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. (25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. (26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). Excerpted from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas: 932-235-50-30 A standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to an entity's interests in both of the following shall be disclosed as of the end of the year: a. Proved oil and gas reserves (see paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B) b. Oil and gas subject to purchase under long-term supply, purchase, or similar agreements and contracts in which the entity participates in the operation of the properties on which the oil or gas is located or otherwise serves as the producer of those reserves (see paragraph 932-235-50-7). The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to those two types of interests in reserves may be combined for reporting purposes. 932-235-50-31 All of the following information shall be disclosed in the aggregate and for each geographic area for which reserve quantities are disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B: a. Future cash inflows. These shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entity's proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. b. Future development and production costs. These costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. If estimated development expenditures are significant, they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs. c. Future income tax expenses. These expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax expenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves. d. Future net cash flows. These amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows. 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) Definitions - Page 6 of 6 e. Discount. This amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. f. Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount. (27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. (28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. (29) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion. (30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area. (31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. From the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (October 26, 2009): Although several types of projects such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas, remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods, this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances. No particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period, and any extension beyond five years should be the exception, and not the rule. Factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include, but are not limited to, the following: The company's level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed (for example, drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities); The company's historical record at completing development of comparable long-term projects; The amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases, or booked the reserves, without significant development activities; The extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan (for example, if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans, recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate); and The extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment (for example, restrictions on development on Federal lands, but not obtaining government permits), rather than by internal factors (for example, shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority). (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. (32) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
