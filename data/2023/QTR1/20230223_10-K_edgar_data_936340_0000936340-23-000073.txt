 Part I 
 
 Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties 
 General 
 In 1995, DTE Energy incorporated in the State of Michigan. DTE Energy's utility operations consist primarily of DTE Electric and DTE Gas. DTE Energy also has two other segments that are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses. 
 DTE Electric is a Michigan corporation organized in 1903 and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy. DTE Electric is a public utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.3 million customers in southeastern Michigan. 
 DTE Gas is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898 and is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy. DTE Gas is a public utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million customers throughout Michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity. 
 DTE Energy's other businesses include 1) DTE Vantage which is primarily involved in renewable natural gas projects and providing custom energy solutions to industrial, commercial, and institutional customers, and 2) energy marketing and trading operations. 
 DTE Electric and DTE Gas are regulated by the MPSC. Certain activities of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, as well as various other aspects of businesses under DTE Energy, are regulated by the FERC. In addition, the Registrants are regulated by other federal and state regulatory agencies including the NRC, the EPA, EGLE, and for DTE Energy, the CFTC and CARB. 
 The Registrants' annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to such reports are available free of charge through the Investor Relations SEC Filings page of DTE Energy's website: www.dteenergy.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
 The DTE Energy Code of Ethics and Standards of Behavior, Board of Directors Mission and Guidelines, Board Committee Charters, and Categorical Standards for Director Independence are also posted on the DTE Energy website. The information on DTE Energy s website is not part of this report or any other report that DTE Energy files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. 
 Additionally, the public may read and copy any materials the Registrants file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov . 
 Corporate Structure 
 DTE Energy sets strategic goals, allocates resources, and evaluates performance based on the following structure. For financial information by segment for the last three years, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Segment and Related Information." 
 Electric 
 The Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, which is engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in southeastern Michigan. 
 Gas 
 The Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas, which is engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout Michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity.

 Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report for an in-depth analysis of each segment s financial results. A description of each business unit follows. 

ELECTRIC 
 Description 
 DTE Energy's Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.3 million customers in southeastern Michigan. DTE Electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and EGLE. Electricity is generated from fossil-fuel plants, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant, a nuclear plant, wind and solar assets, and is supplemented with purchased power. The electricity is sold, or distributed through the retail access program, to three major classes of customers: residential, commercial, and industrial, throughout southeastern Michigan. 
 Weather, economic factors, competition, energy waste reduction initiatives, and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers. DTE Electric's peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands. DTE Electric's operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Electric. 
 The Electric segment also includes non-utility operations relating to renewable energy projects at DTE Sustainable Generation, which were acquired to support DTE Energy's renewable energy goals. 
 For a summary of Electric segment operating revenues by service, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Revenue." 
 Fuel Supply and Purchased Power 
 DTE Electric's power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power. DTE Electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers. DTE Electric's generating capability is dependent upon the availability of coal and natural gas.

Table of Contents 

 Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. DTE Electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases. DTE Electric has long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase of approximately 10 million tons of low-sulfur western coal and approximately 1 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from 2023 to 2024. All of these contracts have pricing schedules. DTE Electric has 96 of its expected coal requirements under contract for 2023. DTE Electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western and eastern coal rail requirements under multi-year contracts. DTE Electric's 2023 rail transportation is covered under long-term agreements. DTE Electric expects to cover all of its 2023 vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities through existing agreements. DTE Electric's natural gas supply requirements are expected to be met through a combination of short and long-term agreements, agreements with local distribution companies, and spot market purchases. Natural gas purchase requirements for 2023 are expected to be approximately 64 Bcf. DTE Electric has contracts for firm gas transportation and storage capacity to ensure reliable and flexible gas supply to its power plants. Given the geographic diversity of supply, DTE Electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements. 
 DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO. DTE Electric offers its generation in the market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load. DTE Electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages.

 Regulation 
 DTE Electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters. DTE Electric's MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments. The FERC regulates DTE Electric with respect to financing authorization, wholesale electric market activities, certain affiliate transactions, the acquisition and disposition of certain generation and other facilities, and, in conjunction with the NERC, compliance with mandatory reliability standards. The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing, and decommissioning of DTE Electric's nuclear plant operations. DTE Electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health. 
 See Notes 8, 9, 12, 18, and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Asset Retirement Obligations," "Regulatory Matters," "Fair Value," "Commitments and Contingencies," and " Nuclear Operations." 
 Energy Assistance Programs 
 Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Electric s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses. DTE Electric s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance that qualifying customers receive. DTE Electric works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory. DTE Electric also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers. 
 Strategy and Competition 
 DTE Electric's electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost-effective manner and support DTE Energy's goal to reduce carbon emissions by 32 by 2023, 65 in 2028, 85 in 2035, and 90 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels, as well as net zero emissions by 2050. These represent accelerated goals compared to DTE Electric's prior targets to reduce carbon emissions by 50 by 2028 and 80 by 2040. With potential capacity constraints in the MISO region, there will be increased dependency on DTE Electric's generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers. 
 To maintain reliability and meet targeted carbon reduction goals in the near-term, DTE Electric will continue its energy waste reduction initiatives and transition away from coal-fired plants to renewable energy and other sources, including leveraging existing infrastructure at the Belle River power plant through a coal to natural gas conversion. To achieve long-term carbon reduction goals, DTE Electric plans to end the use of coal-fired power plants in 2035 and plans significant investments in solar, wind, and battery storage. DTE Electric expects this transition to renewables and natural gas to reduce future operating and fuel costs. DTE Electric will also continue to monitor the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability.

 DTE Electric's distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe, cost-effective, and reliable manner to customers. An increasing intensity of wind storms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term. DTE Electric is hardening and upgrading its infrastructure and has plans to build substations to provide additional capacity as customers shift to more electrification, including electric vehicles. DTE Electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to maintain rate affordability and increase reliability and customer satisfaction through tree trimming, pole maintenance, and other projects. 
 DTE Electric expects opportunities to enhance customer affordability as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022, which includes production tax credits for wind and solar production and existing nuclear generation, as well as investment tax credits for energy storage. DTE Electric expects these tax incentives to reduce the cost of owning assets that support its clean energy transition, thereby reducing customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries. 
 The electric retail access program in Michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers, subject to limits. Energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan has placed a 10 cap on total retail access. This cap mitigates some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on DTE Electric's financial performance and full-service customer rates. Customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers consist primarily of industrial and commercial customers and represented approximately 10 , 10 , and 8.5 of retail sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. DTE Electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will remain at approximately 10 of retail sales in 2023 and future years. 
 Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers. DTE Electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term. 
 Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events, and other risk factors as discussed in the "Risk Factors" in Item 1A. of this Report. 

GAS 
 Description 
 DTE Energy's Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.3 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout Michigan, and the sale of storage and transportation capacity. 
 DTE Gas' natural gas sales, end-user transportation, and intermediate transportation volumes, revenues, and Net Income are impacted by weather. Given the seasonal nature of the business, revenues and earnings are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. By the end of the first quarter, the heating season is largely over, and DTE Gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter, and losses in the third quarter. The impacts of changes in annual average customer usage may be minimized by Revenue Decoupling Mechanisms authorized by the MPSC. 
 DTE Gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Gas. 
 For a summary of Gas segment operating revenues by service, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Revenue." 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 DTE Gas' gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out capacity of 2.4 Bcf, with approximately 64 of the volume coming from underground storage for 2022. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies. Because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity, DTE Gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements. DTE Gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future. 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 DTE Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier, producing region, quantity, and available transportation diversify DTE Gas' natural gas supply base. Natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas (Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada, and Michigan) under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is generally tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with MPSC-approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2025. 
 DTE Gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the Appalachian, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Canadian regions. The primary long-term transportation supply contracts at December 31, 2022 are listed below.

The distribution system includes approximately 21,000 miles of distribution mains, approximately 1,352,000 service pipelines, and approximately 1,316,000 active meters. DTE Gas also owns approximately 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect DTE Gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas. 
 DTE Gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 139 Bcf. These facilities are important in providing reliable and cost-effective service to DTE Gas customers. In addition, DTE Gas sells storage services to third parties. 
 Most of DTE Gas' distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by DTE Gas through easements, permits, or licenses. Substantially all of DTE Gas' property is subject to the lien of a mortgage. 
 DTE Gas leases a portion of its pipeline system through a finance lease arrangement. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Leases." 
 Regulation 
 DTE Gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters. DTE Gas' MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments. DTE Gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to a MPSC-approved tariff. 
 DTE Gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC. The FERC's jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates, non-discriminatory requirements, and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by DTE Gas in interstate markets. FERC granted DTE Gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at market-based rates. DTE Gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and filed with the FERC. 
 DTE Gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health.

 Energy Assistance Programs 
 Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Gas' ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses. DTE Gas' uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive. DTE Gas works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory. DTE Gas also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers. 
 Strategy and Competition 
 DTE Gas' strategy is to ensure the safe, reliable, and cost-effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in Michigan. In addition, DTE Gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to underserved markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces, water heaters, and appliances within its current customer base. DTE Gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy waste reduction products and services to its customers, making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers. 
 Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources. The primary focus of competition for end-user transportation is cost and reliability. Some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil, and steam. If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source, they would not have a need for DTE Gas' end-user transportation service. DTE Gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service, supported by its storage capacity. 
 Having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of DTE Gas' storage and transportation services to gas producers, marketers, distribution companies, end-user customers, and other pipeline companies. The business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the Midwest, eastern United States, and eastern Canada. 
 DTE Gas' storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions, weather, and natural gas pricing. 
 DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65 by 2030 and 80 by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers. To achieve net zero, DTE Gas is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions. DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by 35 by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas.

ENERGY TRADING 
 Description 
 Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers. Energy Trading's customer base is predominantly utilities, local natural gas distribution companies, pipelines, producers and generators, and other marketing and trading companies. Energy Trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within DTE Energy. 
 Energy Trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its marketing and hedging activities. These financial instruments are generally accounted for under the MTM method, which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. Energy Trading utilizes forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity, as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines. 
 Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives. As a result, this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. The business strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. 
 Regulation 
 Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to sell power and blanket authority from the FERC to sell natural gas at market prices. Energy Trading is subject to FERC reporting requirements and market behavior rules. Energy Trading is also subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to the CFTC, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and DOE. In addition, Energy Trading is subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations in Canada.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There are various risks associated with the operations of the Registrants' utility businesses and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses. To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Registrants, below is a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with their businesses. Although the Registrants have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future. Each of the following risks could affect performance. 
 Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks 
 The Registrants are subject to rate regulation. Electric and gas rates for the utilities are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. The Registrants may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC, or other regulatory bodies. The Registrants' ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurring of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates. Regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under current governing laws and regulations. Regulators may also disagree with the Registrants' rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to their utilities related to certain aspects of the business. If the Registrants cannot agree with regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact the Registrants' ability to recover certain costs through customer rates. Regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for the Registrants to recover their costs in the rates charged to customers. The Registrants cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases. New legislation, regulations, or interpretations could change how the business operates, impact the Registrants' ability to recover costs through rates or the timing of such recovery, or require the Registrants to incur additional expenses. 
 Changes to Michigan's electric retail access program could negatively impact the Registrants' financial performance. The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for DTE Electric customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. MPSC rate orders, and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan, have placed a 10 cap on the total potential retail access migration. However, even with the legislated 10 cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric retail access program. Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes. The Registrants are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity. 
 Environmental laws and liability may be costly. The Registrants are subject to, and affected by, numerous environmental regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses, and plant down times, and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers. 
 Uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in the Registrants' generation fleet and for DTE Energy's gas distribution businesses. These laws and regulations require the Registrants to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other regulatory approvals. The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations. Additionally, the Registrants may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body. The Registrants cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties. 
 The Registrants may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in Michigan, the United States, and worldwide to reduce GHGs such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels. If increased regulations of GHG emissions are implemented, or if existing deadlines for these regulations are accelerated, the operations of DTE Electric's fossil-fueled generation assets may be significantly impacted. Increased environmental regulation may also result in greater energy efficiency requirements and decreased demand at both the electric and gas utilities. Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, the Registrants' financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters. 
 Any perceived or alleged failure by the Registrants to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or could result in adverse public statements and reputational damage affecting the Registrants. Adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims.

 The Renewable Portfolio Standard and energy waste reduction may affect the Registrants' business and federal and state fuel standards may affect DTE Energy's non-utility investments. The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of renewable energy. The Registrants have complied with the existing federal and state legislation, but do not know what requirements may be added by federal or state legislation in the future. In addition, the Registrants expect to comply with new Michigan legislation increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources. The Registrants cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations. Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates charged to customers. 
 In addition, the Registrants are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy waste reduction measures and provide energy waste reduction customer awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate expenditures, and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing the Registrants' revenues as customers decrease their energy usage. The Registrants cannot predict how these programs will impact their business and future operating results. 
 DTE Energy's non-utility renewable natural gas investments are also dependent on the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Changes to these standards may affect DTE Energy's business and result in lower earnings. 
 DTE Energy's ability to utilize tax credits may be limited. To promote U.S. climate initiatives, the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce energy from alternative sources. The Registrants have generated tax credits from renewable energy generation and DTE Energy has generated tax credits from renewable gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, and gas production operations. If the Registrants' tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact the Registrants' earnings and cash flows. 
 Operational Risks 
 The Registrants' electric distribution system and DTE Energy's gas distribution system are subject to risks from their operation, which could reduce revenues, increase expenses, and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, and results of operations. The Registrants' electric distribution and DTE Energy s gas distribution systems are subject to many operational risks. These operational systems and infrastructure have been in service for many years. Equipment, even when maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants' control, and could require significant operation and maintenance expense or capital expenditures to operate efficiently. Because the Registrants distribution systems are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of the Registrants systems could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the systems of such third parties. 
 Construction and capital improvements to the Registrants' power facilities and DTE Energy's distribution systems subject them to risk. The Registrants are managing ongoing, and planning future, significant construction and capital improvement projects at the Registrants' multiple power generation and distribution facilities and at DTE Energy's gas distribution system. Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond the Registrants' control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits or approvals (including required certificates from regulatory agencies), construction disputes, impediments to acquiring rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, cost overruns, and weather conditions. Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect the Registrants' financial performance, operations, or expected investment returns at the affected facilities, businesses and development projects. 
 Operation of a nuclear facility subjects the Registrants to risk. Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects the Registrants to significant additional risks. These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation, increased capital expenditures to meet industry requirements, and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility compared to other generation options. Insurance maintained by the Registrants for various nuclear-related risks may not be sufficient to cover the Registrants' costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at the nuclear generating plant, which may affect the Registrants' financial performance. In addition, the Registrants' nuclear decommissioning trust fund, to finance the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant, may not be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning. A decline in market value of assets held in decommissioning trust funds due to poor investment performance or other factors may increase the funding requirements for these obligations. Any increase in funding requirements may have a material impact on the Registrants liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

 The supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results. The Registrants are dependent on coal for much of their electrical generating capacity as well as uranium for their nuclear operations. DTE Energy's access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for utility gas customers. DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services. Price fluctuations and changes in transportation costs, driven by inflation or other factors, as well as fuel supply disruptions, could have a negative impact on the amounts DTE Electric charges utility customers for electricity and DTE Gas charges utility customers for gas, and on the profitability of DTE Energy's non-utility businesses. The Registrants' hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms may be insufficient to mitigate the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices at their utility or DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants' financial performance may therefore be negatively impacted by price fluctuations. 
 The price of energy also impacts the market for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, particularly those that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers. The price of environmental attributes generated by DTE Energy's renewable natural gas investments, including those related to the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility businesses. 
 The supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact the Registrants' financial results . The Registrants are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials, and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of their facilities. Price fluctuations, driven by inflation or other factors, or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items, could have a negative impact on the amounts charged to customers for the Registrants' utility products and, for DTE Energy, on the profitability of the non-utility businesses. 
 Weather significantly affects operations. As weather patterns exhibit increased deviations from historical trends, our utilities may experience financial and operational challenges. Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows. At DTE Electric, high winds, floods, tornadoes, or ice storms can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require it to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Prolonged and/or more frequent outages caused by increasingly extreme weather may result in decreased revenues and could also negatively impact DTE Energy's reputation and customer satisfaction or result in increased regulatory oversight. Related damages to customer assets could subject DTE Energy to litigation. DTE Gas can also experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather-related issues. 
 Unplanned power plant outages may be costly. Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, the Registrants may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed the costs of generation. The Registrants' financial performance may be negatively affected if unable to recover such increased costs. 
 A work interruption may adversely affect the Registrants. There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 5,050 and DTE Electric's approximately 2,600 represented employees. The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2027. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on the Registrants' businesses. The Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance.

 DTE Energy may not achieve the carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities. DTE Energy has announced the voluntary commitments of its electric and gas utilities to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, along with intermediate emissions reduction goals at various points in the intervening years. Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements are critical to DTE Energy's ability to achieve these commitments, but they may not evolve as anticipated in order to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional energy sources. State and municipal restrictions on the siting of renewable energy assets could also impair efforts to meet our stated targets. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will receive regulatory approval of our capital plans to transition to renewable energy and other new technologies. Other factors that may impact DTE Energy's ability to achieve these emissions reduction goals include our service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with current expectations, the impacts on our business of future regulations or legislation, the price and availability of carbon offsets, adoption of alternative energy products by the public such as greater use of electric vehicles, greater standardization of emissions reporting, and our ability over time to transition our electric generating portfolio. DTE Energy's emissions reduction goals require making assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions reduction goals could differ materially from expectations. In addition, DTE Energy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects on its reliability or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. DTE Energy could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if we are unable to meet our voluntary emissions reductions goals. 
 Financial, Economic, and Market Risks 
 DTE Energy's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations. DTE Energy relies on non-utility businesses for a portion of earnings and will depend on the successful execution of new business development in its non-utilities to help achieve overall growth targets. DTE Energy also expects to grow the non-utility businesses by developing or acquiring renewable energy and customer energy solutions projects over the long term; however, such opportunities may not materialize as anticipated. If DTE Energy's current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, DTE Energy could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in shareholder value. 
 Adverse changes in the Registrants' credit ratings may negatively affect them. Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in the Registrants' economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining their credit ratings. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in the Registrants' credit ratings below investment grade could restrict or discontinue their ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in their borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures, and could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a reduction in the Registrants' credit ratings may require them to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products, and services, which could impact their liquidity. 
 Poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact the Registrants' liquidity and results of operations. The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and the Registrants' required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Registrants' plans. The Registrants have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below the Registrants' projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding needs under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding needs. Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from the Registrants' utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of the Registrants could be negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of plan assets, the Registrants could be required to fund these plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on the Registrants' cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.

 The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important. The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses and to fund capital investments. Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the ability of Registrants and their subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and to refinance existing debt. Macroeconomic events may lead to higher interest rates on debt and could increase financing costs and adversely affect the Registrants' results of operations. In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit the Registrants' access to capital markets. The Registrants' long-term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2027, but the Registrants regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at the Registrants' utilities and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses, and the Registrants cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions. 
 Emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants . Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption include cost-effective renewable energy technologies, distributed generation, energy waste reduction technologies, and energy storage devices. Such developments may impact the price of energy, may affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, may require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and could make portions of our electric system power supply and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could materially affect the Registrants results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. 
 DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk. Events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole. In certain situations, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial. If access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, DTE Energy could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows. Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE Energy to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather, and other related risks. DTE Energy's trading business routinely has speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines DTE Energy sets, resulting from the management of DTE Energy's business portfolio. To the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish DTE Energy's financial results and financial position. DTE Energy manages its exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures. During periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. 
 Regional, national, and international economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on the Registrants. The Registrants' utility and DTE Energy's non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers they serve and credit risk of counterparties they do business with. Should the financial conditions of some of DTE Energy's significant customers deteriorate as a result of regional, national or international economic conditions, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services DTE Energy supplies, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flows. 
 If DTE Energy's goodwill becomes impaired, it may be required to record a charge to earnings. DTE Energy annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions it has made for impairment. Goodwill is also reviewed on a quarterly basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower industry growth rates, or material changes with customers or contracts that could negatively impact future cash flows. DTE Energy cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of such changes or any subsequent recovery. If the carrying value of any goodwill is determined to be not recoverable, DTE Energy may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact DTE Energy's results of operations and financial position. 
 The Registrants may not be fully covered by insurance. The Registrants have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of severe weather or other natural disasters, war, terrorism, cyber incidents, liability claims against the Registrants, or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact the Registrants' operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance, or the Registrants' insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.

 Safety and Security Risks 
 The Registrants' businesses have safety risks. The Registrants' electric distribution system, power plants, renewable energy equipment, and other facilities, and DTE Energy's gas distribution system, gas infrastructure, and other facilities, could be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public. Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities. 
 Threats of cyber incidents, physical security, and terrorism could affect the Registrants' business. Issues may threaten the Registrants such as cyber incidents, physical security, or terrorism that may disrupt the Registrants' operations, and could harm the Registrants' operating results. 
 Information security risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, and data security breaches. The Registrants' industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information and control technology systems and network infrastructure. All of the Registrants' technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber incidents, physical security threats, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes, as well as loss of operational control of the Registrants' electric generation and distribution assets and, DTE Energy's gas distribution assets. The Registrants have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents. If the Registrants' information technology systems were to fail and they were unable to recover in a timely way, the Registrants may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants' business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support the Registrants operations and maintain customer and employee data. A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect the business as if it was a breach of our own system. Also , because the Registrants generation and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, system operator, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect the Registrants businesses, operating results, and financial condition. 
 In addition, the Registrants' generation plants and electrical distribution facilities may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt the Registrants' ability to produce or distribute some portion of their products. The Registrants have increased security as a result of past events and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that the Registrants cannot currently predict. 
 Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect the Registrants. In connection with the Registrants' businesses, they collect and retain personally identifiable information of their customers, shareholders, and employees. Customers, shareholders, and employees expect that the Registrants will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee, or Registrant data by cybercrime or otherwise, could adversely impact the Registrants' reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines, and litigation. 
 General and Other Risks 
 Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the Registrants operations. The Registrants' businesses are dependent on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high, and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect the Registrants' business and future operating results. In addition, the Registrants have an aging utility workforce, and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact their operations. 
 DTE Energy relies on cash flows from subsidiaries. DTE Energy is a holding company. Cash flows from the utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on DTE Energy debt and securities. Should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to DTE Energy, its ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following combined discussion is separately filed by DTE Energy and DTE Electric. However, DTE Electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself. 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 DTE Energy is a diversified energy company with 2022 Operating Revenues of approximately 19.2 billion and Total Assets of approximately 42.7 billion. DTE Energy is the parent company of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution, and storage services throughout Michigan. DTE Energy also operates two energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the United States. 
 On July 1, 2021, DTE Energy completed the separation of DT Midstream, its former natural gas pipeline, storage, and gathering non-utility business. Financial results of DT Midstream are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Discontinued Operations, for additional information. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below reflect DTE Energy s continuing operations, unless noted otherwise. The following table summarizes DTE Energy's financial results: 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company Continuing operations 1,083 796 1,054 Diluted Earnings per Common Share Continuing operations 5.52 4.10 5.45 
 The increase in 2022 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company was primarily due to higher earnings in the Electric, Gas, and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the DTE Vantage and Energy Trading segments. The decrease in 2021 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company was primarily due to lower earnings in the Corporate and Other segment, driven primarily by losses on the extinguishment of debt incurred in 2021. The decrease was also due to lower earnings in the Energy Trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the Electric, Gas, and DTE Vantage segments. 
 STRATEGY 
 DTE Energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings per share growth with a strong balance sheet and attractive dividend. 
 DTE Energy's utilities are investing capital to support a modern, reliable grid and cleaner, affordable energy through investments in base infrastructure and new generation. Increasing intensity of wind storms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term. 
 DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 32 by 2023, 65 in 2028, 85 in 2035, and 90 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels. These represent accelerated goals compared to the electric utility's prior targets to reduce carbon emissions by 50 by 2028 and 80 by 2040. DTE Energy plans to end its use of coal-fired power plants in 2035 and is committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric and gas utility operations. 
 To achieve the targeted carbon reduction goals at the electric utility, DTE Energy will continue its transition away from coal-powered energy sources and is replacing or offsetting the generation from these facilities with renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage, and energy waste reduction initiatives. Refer to the "Capital Investments" section below for further discussion regarding DTE Energy's retirement of its aging coal-fired plants and transition to renewable energy and other sources. Over the long-term, DTE Energy is also monitoring the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, hydrogen, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability.

 For the gas utility, DTE Energy aims to cut carbon emissions across the entire value chain. DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65 by 2030 and 80 by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers. To achieve net zero, DTE Energy is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its gas main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions. DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by 35 by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. 
 DTE Energy expects that these initiatives at the electric and gas utilities will continue to provide significant opportunities for capital investments and result in earnings growth. DTE Energy is focused on executing its plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability. DTE Energy expects its goals for customer affordability to be aided by operational efficiencies and new opportunities resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022. Such opportunities include tax credits for renewable energy, nuclear generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and sequestration, which are expected to reduce the cost of owning related assets and reduce customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries. DTE Energy's utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with their regulators. 
 DTE Energy also has significant investments in non-utility businesses and expects growth opportunities in its DTE Vantage segment. DTE Energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets, skills, and expertise, and provides attractive returns and diversity in earnings and geography. Specifically, DTE Energy invests in targeted markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile. 
 A key priority for DTE Energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced financing. Growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity. DTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates, and counterparty credit risk. 
 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS 
 DTE Energy's utility businesses will require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and achieve goals for carbon emission reductions. Capital plans may be regularly updated as these requirements and goals evolve and may be subject to regulatory approval. 
 DTE Electric's capital investments over the 2023-2027 period are estimated at 18 billion, comprised of 9 billion for distribution infrastructure, 4 billion for base infrastructure, and 5 billion for cleaner generation including renewables. DTE Electric has retired all eleven coal-fired generation units at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities, including five units that were retired in the third quarter 2022, and has announced plans to retire its remaining six coal-fired generating units. DTE Electric plans to convert the two units at the Belle River facility from a base load coal plant to a natural gas peaking resource in 2025-2026. The four units at the Monroe facility are expected to be retired in two stages in 2028 and 2035. Generation from the retired facilities will continue to be replaced or offset with a combination of renewables, energy waste reduction, demand response, battery storage, and natural gas fueled generation, including the Blue Water Energy Center which commenced operations in June 2022. 
 DTE Gas' capital investments over the 2023-2027 period are estimated at 3.6 billion, comprised of 2 billion for base infrastructure and 1.6 billion for the gas renewal program, which includes main and service renewals, meter move-out, and pipeline integrity projects. 
 DTE Electric and DTE Gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment. 
 DTE Energy's non-utility businesses' capital investments are primarily for expansion, growth, and ongoing maintenance in the DTE Vantage segment, including approximately 1 billion to 1.5 billion from 2023-2027 for renewable energy and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 The Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations, including those addressing climate change. Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary substantially. The Registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers, as authorized by the MPSC. 
 Increased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources due to recent, pending, and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas fueled generation, and/or nuclear sources, energy waste reduction initiatives, and the potential development of market-based trading of carbon instruments. 
 Refer to the "Environmental Matters" section within Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies," for further discussion of Environmental Matters. 
 OUTLOOK 
 The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry. DTE Energy's strong utility base, combined with its integrated non-utility operations, position it well for long-term growth. 
 Looking forward, DTE Energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance: 
 electric and gas customer satisfaction; 
 electric distribution system reliability; 
 new electric generation and storage; 
 gas distribution system renewal; 
 reducing carbon emissions at the electric and gas utilities; 
 rate competitiveness and affordability; 
 regulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities; 
 strategic investments in growth projects at DTE Vantage; 
 employee engagement, health, safety and wellbeing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion; 
 cost structure optimization across all business segments; and 
 cash, capital, and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength. 
 DTE Energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic, financial, and risk criteria. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as the non-GAAP financial measures, Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin, discussed below, which DTE Energy uses as measures of its operational performance. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 DTE Energy uses Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin, non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance by reportable segment. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 Utility Margin includes electric utility and gas utility Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses. The utilities fuel, purchased power, and natural gas supply are passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to the utilities revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses. As such, DTE Energy believes Utility Margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the utilities operations across periods, as it excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses. For the Electric segment, non-utility Operating Revenues are reported separately so that Utility Margin can be used to assess utility performance. 
 The Non-utility Margin relates to the DTE Vantage and Energy Trading segments. For the DTE Vantage segment, Non-utility Margin primarily includes Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses. Operating Revenues include sales of renewable natural gas and related credits, metallurgical coke and related by-products, petroleum coke, and electricity, as well as rental income and revenues from utility-type consulting, management, and operational services. For the prior periods, Operating revenues also include sales of refined coal to third parties and the affiliated Electric utility. For the Energy Trading segment, Non-utility Margin includes revenue and realized and unrealized gains and losses from physical and financial power and gas marketing, optimization, and trading activities, net of Purchased power and gas related to these activities. DTE Energy evaluates its operating performance of these non-utility businesses using the measure of Operating Revenues net of Fuel, purchased power, and gas expenses. 
 Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the results of operations presented in accordance with GAAP. Utility Margin and Non-utility Margin do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of operating performance and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of DTE Energy's segments. Segment information, described below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses, and other income and deductions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 DTE Electric sales and deliveries decreased in 2022, primarily due to a decrease in residential sales as customers resumed more pre-pandemic activities and worked less from their homes. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to commercial customers which were impacted more significantly in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and temporary shut-downs of certain commercial operations. 
 Operating Revenues Non-utility operations increased 3 million in 2022 and decreased 2 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and prices at DTE Sustainable Generation. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to lower sales volumes at DTE Sustainable Generation. 
 Operation and maintenance expense increased 8 million in 2022 and 67 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher EWR expense of 29 million and higher distribution operations expense of 7 million, partially offset by lower benefits and other compensation expense of 17 million and lower legal and environmental expense of 12 million. 
 The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher EWR expense of 45 million, higher distribution operations expense of 42 million (primarily due to higher storm costs), higher corporate support costs of 21 million, higher legal and environmental expense of 15 million, and higher benefits and other compensation expense of 13 million. These increases were partially offset by lower COVID-19 related expenses of 43 million, lower uncollectible expense of 26 million, and lower plant generation expense of 4 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 96 million in 2022 and 65 million in 2021. In 2022, the increase was primarily due to a 101 million increase from a higher depreciable base, partially offset by a decrease of 9 million associated with the TRM. In 2021, the increase was primarily due to a 64 million increase resulting from a higher depreciable base. 
 Taxes other than income increased 18 million in 2022 and 24 million in 2021. In 2022, the increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 16 million as a result of a higher tax base. In 2021, the increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 22 million as a result of an increase in tax base and a favorable property tax settlement in 2020. 
 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net increased 7 million in 2022 and decreased 40 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to previously recorded capital expenditures of 8 million that were disallowed in the November 18, 2022 rate order from the MPSC. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to a 41 million write-off of capital expenditures related to incentive compensation in 2020. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions increased 2 million in 2022 and decreased 43 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to a change in rabbi trust and other investment earnings (net loss of 10 million in 2022 compared to a net gain of 9 million in 2021) and higher net interest of 27 million, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement benefits expense of 37 million and a 4 million decrease in non-operational costs that ceased with the retirement of a power plant. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to lower contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations of 28 million, a change in rabbi trust investment earnings (net gain of 7 million in 2021 compared to a net loss of 3 million in 2020), and lower non-operating retirement benefits expense of 4 million.

Table of Contents 

 Income Tax Expense decreased 79 million in 2022 and 4 million in 2021. The decreases in both periods were primarily due to higher amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability and higher production tax credits, partially offset by higher earnings. 
 Outlook DTE Electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity. DTE Electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth. DTE Electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while keeping customer rate increases affordable. Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, benefit plan design changes, uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change, and effects of energy waste reduction programs. 
 DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on February 10, 2023 requesting an increase in base rates of 622 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending November 30, 2024, and in increase in return on equity from 9.9 to 10.25 . The requested increase in base rates is primarily due to increased investments in plant involving generation and the electric distribution system, as well as related increases to depreciation and property tax expenses. These investments will support DTE Energy's goals to reduce carbon emissions and improve power reliability. The requested increase in base rates is also due to a projected sales decline from the level included in current rates and inflationary impacts on operating and interest costs. A final MPSC order in this case is expected in December 2023. 

GAS 
 The Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas. Gas results and outlook are discussed below: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Operating Revenues Utility operations 1,924 1,553 1,414 Cost of gas utility 632 422 356 Utility Margin 1,292 1,131 1,058 Operation and maintenance 552 521 496 Depreciation and amortization 192 177 157 Taxes other than income 101 93 84 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net 4 14 Operating Income 447 336 307 Other (Income) and Deductions 87 84 73 Income Tax Expense 88 38 48 Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company 272 214 186

The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher gas operations expense of 41 million, partially offset by lower uncollectible expense of 15 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 million in 2022 and 20 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to a higher depreciable base. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to a higher depreciable base and change in depreciation rates effective October 2020. 
 Taxes other than income increased 8 million in 2022 and 9 million in 2021. The 2022 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 7 million. The 2021 increase was primarily due to higher property taxes of 6 million and employee retention credits of 3 million recognized in 2020 pursuant to the CARES Act. 
 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net decreased 4 million in 2022 and 10 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to capital write-offs of 4 million in 2021. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to the 4 million of capital write-offs compared to 14 million of capital write-offs in 2020 related to incentive compensation. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions increased 3 million in 2022 and 11 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to a change in investment earnings (loss of 6 million in 2022 compared to a gain of 3 million in 2021) and higher net interest expense of 7 million, partially offset by 2021 contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations of 12 million. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations. 
 Income Tax Expense increased 50 million in 2022 and decreased 10 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher earnings and lower amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability. The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to higher amortization of the TCJA regulatory liability, partially offset by higher earnings. 
 Outlook DTE Gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity. DTE Gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth. Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, and benefit plan design changes. DTE Gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.

 Operation and maintenance expense decreased 34 million in 2022 and increased 7 million in 2021. The 2022 decrease was primarily due to 37 million associated with the closure of the REF business and 6 million of lower corporate overhead costs, partially offset by an 8 million increase due to a new contract in the Renewables business. The 2021 increase was primarily due to higher production and new projects, partially offset by closed projects. 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 19 million in 2022 and 1 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to the closure of the REF business. 
 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net changed by 35 million in 2022 from the net loss of 28 million in 2021, and changed by 46 million in 2021 from the net gain of 18 million in 2020. The change in 2022 was primarily due to an asset impairment of 27 million recorded in the Steel business in 2021 for the anticipated closure of a pulverized coal facility, as well as a 5 million gain recorded in the Renewables business in 2022 related to lower future contingent obligations. 
 The change in 2021 was primarily due to the asset impairment of 27 million recorded in the Steel business compared to 18 million of gain activity in 2020, which included 11 million in the Steel business for an asset sale and write-off of environmental liabilities, 4 million for the sale of assets in the On-site business, and 2 million for the divestiture of a project in the Renewables business. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions decreased 127 million in 2022 and increased 22 million in 2021. The 2022 decrease was primarily due to 143 million lower income associated with the closure of the REF business, partially offset by 14 million lower interest expense. The 2021 increase was primarily due to a 22 million settlement charge associated with a qualified pension plan in the Steel business recorded in 2020. The 2021 increase also included higher production in the REF business, offset by profit recognized from the sale of membership interests recorded in 2020. 
 Income Taxes Expense decreased 10 million in 2022 and increased 11 million in 2021. The change in both periods was primarily due to changes in pre-tax income, inclusive of pre-tax income (loss) at non-controlling interests. 
 Income Taxes Production Tax Credits decreased by 59 million in 2022 and increased by 2 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to the closure of the REF business. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher production, partially offset by the sale of membership interests in the REF business. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests decreased by 10 million in 2022 and increased by 1 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to the closure of the REF business.

 DTE Vantage will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional renewable natural gas projects and other projects that provide customer specific energy solutions. DTE Vantage is also developing decarbonization opportunities relating to carbon capture and sequestration projects. 

ENERGY TRADING 
 Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers. Energy Trading results and outlook are discussed below: 
 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Operating Revenues Non-utility operations 10,308 6,831 3,863 Purchased power and gas non-utility 10,331 6,825 3,725 Non-utility Margin (23) 6 138 Operation and maintenance 64 81 77 Depreciation and amortization 5 6 5 Taxes other than income 7 5 4 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net 2 Operating Income (Loss) (101) (86) 52 Other (Income) and Deductions 22 24 4 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (31) (27) 12 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to DTE Energy Company (92) (83) 36 
 Operating Revenues Non-utility operations and Purchased power and gas non-utility increased in both periods primarily due to significantly higher gas prices in the gas structured and gas transportation strategies. 
 Non-utility Margin decreased by 29 million in 2022 and 132 million in 2021. The following tables detail changes in Non-Utility margin relative to the comparable prior periods:

 Operation and maintenance expense decreased 17 million in 2022 and increased 4 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 and increase in 2021 were primarily due to lower and higher compensation costs, respectively. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions decreased 2 million in 2022 and increased 20 million in 2021. The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to 10 million of lower contributions to not-for-profit organizations, partially offset by higher net interest expense of 7 million. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and other not-for-profit organizations. 
 Outlook In the near-term, Energy Trading expects market conditions to remain challenging. The profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes, and changes in operating rules of RTOs. Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives. As a result, Energy Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. Energy Trading's strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.

CORPORATE AND OTHER 
 Corporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds certain investments, including funds supporting regional development and economic growth. The 2022 net loss of 145 million represents a decrease of 222 million from the 2021 net loss of 367 million. This decrease was primarily due to one-time items following the separation of DT Midstream in 2021, including a 294 million earnings impact from losses on debt extinguishment, partially offset by a reduction to Income Tax Expense of 85 million for the remeasurement of state deferred taxes. The remaining decrease of 13 million in 2022 was primarily due to lower state income taxes, lower valuation allowances, and a gain on sale of assets, partially offset by equity investment losses and one-time benefits expenses.

Table of Contents 

 The 2021 net loss of 367 million represents an increase of 288 million from the 2020 net loss of 79 million. This increase was primarily due to higher losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2021 following the separation of DT Midstream, which reduced earnings by 294 million, higher net interest expense, and a valuation allowance established in 2021 for certain charitable contribution carryforwards. The higher loss was also due to the carryback of 2018 net operating losses to 2013 pursuant to the CARES Act, which resulted in a 34 million reduction to Income Tax Expense in 2020. The losses in 2021 were partially offset by the remeasurement of state deferred taxes following the separation of DT Midstream, which resulted in an 85 million reduction to Income Tax Expense in 2021. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 Cash Requirements 
 DTE Energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities, to grow the non-utility businesses, to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, and to pay dividends. DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. DTE Energy expects that cash from operations in 2023 will be approximately 3.2 billion. DTE Energy anticipates base level utility capital investments, including environmental, renewable, and energy waste reduction expenditures, and expenditures for non-utility businesses of approximately 4.2 billion in 2023. DTE Energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict risk-return and value creation criteria. 
 Refer below for analysis of cash flows relating to operating, investing, and financing activities, which reflect DTE Energy's change in financial condition. Any significant non-cash items are included in the Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Cash from Operating Activities 
 A majority of DTE Energy's operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric retail access, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs. 
 Net cash from operations decreased 1.1 billion in 2022. The reduction was primarily due to lower cash from working capital items. The reduction was also partially due to changes in Net income, which decreased year-over-year if adjusted for the Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2021, primarily driven by the separation of DT Midstream in July 2021 and the closure of the REF business at DTE Vantage in 2022. 
 Net cash from operations decreased 630 million in 2021. The reduction was primarily due to a decrease in Deferred income taxes, working capital items, and Net Income, adjusted for the Loss on extinguishment of debt. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in Depreciation and amortization. 
 The change in working capital items in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in cash related to Regulatory assets and liabilities, Accounts receivable, net, and Accounts payable, partially offset by increases related to Prepaid postretirement benefit costs, Accrued pension liability, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. The change in working capital items in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease related to Accrued pension liability, Accounts receivable, net, Inventories, Accrued postretirement liability, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase related to Regulatory assets and liabilities, Accounts payable, and Derivative assets and liabilities. 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Changes in working capital during 2022 were significantly impacted by higher prices for natural gas and electricity, including Accounts receivable at the utilities, Accounts payable in the Electric and Energy Trading segments, and Regulatory assets attributed to the PSCR mechanism at DTE Electric. Refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within Item 7A of this Report for additional information regarding DTE Energy's management of commodity price and other market risks. 
 Cash used for Investing Activities 
 Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions. In any given year, DTE Energy looks to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured, fully valued assets. 
 Capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements. 
 Capital spending within the non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion, and growth. DTE Energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks, and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. DTE Energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria. For new business lines, DTE Energy initially invests based on research and analysis. DTE Energy starts with a limited investment, evaluates the results, and either expands or exits the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of DTE Energy, with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings. 
 Net cash used for investing activities decreased 432 million in 2022 due primarily to decreases in utility plant and equipment expenditures and non-utility plant and equipment expenditures. 
 Net cash used for investing activities decreased 207 million in 2021 due primarily to decreases in non-utility plant and equipment expenditures and Acquisitions related to business combinations, net of cash acquired, partially offset by an increase in utility plant and equipment expenditures. 
 Cash from Financing Activities 
 DTE Energy relies on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations. 
 DTE Energy's strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. DTE Energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating. 
 Net cash from financing activities increased 1.1 billion in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the Issuance of common stock in 2022, decreases in Redemption of long-term debt and Prepayment costs for extinguishment of long-term debt, and lower Dividends on common stock. The increase was partially offset by decreases in Issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and Short-term borrowings, net. The lower amount of long-term debt activity was primarily due to 3.1 billion of new issuances and 2.6 billion of redemptions in 2021 related to the separation of DT Midstream. 
 Net cash used for financing activities decreased 481 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in Redemption of long-term debt, Prepayment costs for redemption of long-term debt, Repurchase of common stock, and Dividends paid on common stock, partially offset by increases in the Issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and Short-term borrowings, net, as well as the Acquisition related deferred payment made in 2020.

 Outlook 
 Sources of Cash 
 DTE Energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the long-term, primarily as a result of growth from the utility and non-utility businesses. Growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined. DTE Energy expects long-term growth in sales related to vehicle electrification, but no significant impacts in the near-term. Non-utility growth is expected from additional investments in the DTE Vantage segment, primarily related to renewable energy and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration. DTE Vantage expects enhanced growth opportunities in decarbonization as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022, including tax credits for renewable natural gas and carbon capture projects. 
 DTE Energy's utilities may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of MPSC orders. Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. DTE Energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of long-term capital projects. 
 At the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions, DTE Energy expects to issue up to 100 million of equity in 2023. If issued, DTE Energy anticipates these discretionary equity issuances would be made through contributions to the dividend reinvestment plan and/or employee benefit plans. 
 Over the long-term, DTE Energy does not have any equity commitments and will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis. DTE Energy currently expects its primary source of long-term financing to be the issuance of debt and is monitoring the impact of rising interest rates on the cost of borrowing. 
 Uses of Cash 
 DTE Energy has 1.1 billion in long-term debt, including finance leases, maturing in the next twelve months. Repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds and the issuance of short-term and/or long-term debt. 
 DTE Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future, including approximately 0.8 billion in 2023. Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may depend on DTE Energy's future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition. Over the long-term, DTE Energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pure-play utility companies. Dividends are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings." However, these restrictions are not expected to impact DTE Energy's planned dividend payments. 
 Various subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific. For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was 571 million. 
 For cash obligations related to leases and future purchase commitments, refer to Note 17 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Leases." and "Commitments and Contingencies," respectively. Purchase commitments include capital expenditures that are contractually obligated. Also refer to the "Capital Investments" section above for additional information on DTE Energy's capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years.

 Other obligations are further described in the following Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: 
 Note Title 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation 9 Regulatory Matters 10 Income Taxes 13 Financial and Other Derivative Instruments 14 Long-Term Debt 16 Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings 18 Commitments and Contingencies 20 Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets 21 Stock-Based Compensation 
 Liquidity 
 DTE Energy has approximately 2.1 billion of available liquidity at December 31, 2022, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements and term loans. 
 DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. However, virtually all DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' credit ratings affect their costs of capital and other terms of financing, as well as their ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' management believes that the current credit ratings provide sufficient access to capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. 
 As part of the normal course of business, DTE Electric, DTE Gas, and various non-utility subsidiaries of DTE Energy routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage, and other energy-related products and services. Certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that DTE Energy posts cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. Also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas could have restricted access to the commercial paper market, and if DTE Energy is downgraded below investment grade, the non-utility businesses could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. A downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas and their subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. The impact of a downgrade will not affect DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas' ability to comply with existing debt covenants. While DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, they cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Registrants' management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Regulation 
 A significant portion of the Registrants' businesses are subject to regulation. This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses. DTE Electric and DTE Gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Registrants' businesses. The Registrants' management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment. 
 See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters." 
 Derivatives 
 Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change. The normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. Contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value. Substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by DTE Electric and DTE Gas meet the criteria specified for this exception. 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable inputs. The Registrants make certain assumptions they believe that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Registrants and their counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Registrants believe they use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 
 The fair values the Registrants calculate for their derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information. Actual cash returns realized on derivatives may be different from the results the Registrants estimate using models. As fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, the Registrants perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of forward contracts. See the sensitivity analysis in Item 7A. of this report, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." See also the "Fair Value" section herein. 
 See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value" and "Financial and Other Derivative Instruments," respectively. 
 Goodwill 
 Certain of DTE Energy's reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from business combinations. DTE Energy performs an impairment test for each of the reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. 
 In performing the impairment test, DTE Energy compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 DTE Energy estimates the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. For certain reporting units, the fair values were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. The income approach includes a terminal value that utilizes an assumed long-term growth rate approach, which incorporates management's assumptions regarding sustainable long-term growth of the reporting units. The income approach cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 One of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of the test date. 
 DTE Energy performs an annual impairment test each October. In between annual tests, DTE Energy monitors its estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters, and will update the impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. While DTE Energy believes the assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from projections. To the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact DTE Energy's earnings. 
 DTE Energy performed its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2022 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed. 
 The results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows as of the October 1, 2022 valuation date: 
 Reporting Unit Goodwill Fair Value Reduction (a) 
 Discount Rate Valuation Methodology (b)(c) 
 (In millions) Electric 1,208 38 7.6 DCF and market multiples analysis Gas 743 29 7.7 DCF and market multiples analysis DTE Vantage 25 75 9.2 DCF and market multiples analysis Energy Trading 17 94 10.7 DCF 1,993 
 ______________________________________ 
 (a) Percentage by which the fair value of equity of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value, including goodwill. 
 (b) Discounted cash flows (DCF) incorporated 2023-2027 projected cash flows plus a calculated terminal value. For each of the reporting units, DTE Energy capitalized the terminal year cash flows at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) less an assumed long-term growth rate of 2.5 . Management applied equal weighting to the DCF and market multiples analysis, where applicable, to determine the fair value of the respective reporting units. 
 (c) Due to lack of market comparable information for the Energy Trading reporting unit, DTE Energy did not perform a market multiples analysis. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life. The review of long-lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value. An impairment would require the Registrants to reduce both the long-lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact their earnings. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Costs 
 DTE Energy sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the Registrants. The measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. When determining the various assumptions that are required, DTE Energy considers historical information as well as future expectations. The benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, benefit plan design changes, and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 DTE Energy had pension costs of 123 million in 2022, 139 million in 2021, and 148 million in 2020. Other postretirement benefit credits were 66 million in 2022, 59 million in 2021, and 49 million in 2020. Pension costs and other postretirement benefit credits for 2022 were calculated based upon several actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.80 for the pension plans and 6.40 for the other postretirement benefit plans. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, DTE Energy evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. Projected returns are based on broad equity, bond, and other markets. DTE Energy's 2023 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 30 in equity markets, 48 in fixed income markets, including long duration bonds, and 22 invested in other assets. DTE Energy's 2023 expected long-term rate of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active and passive investment management of 10 in equity markets, 61 in fixed income markets - including long duration bonds, and 29 invested in other assets. Because of market volatility, DTE Energy periodically reviews the asset allocation and rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. DTE Energy is increasing its long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plans to 7.60 and increasing the other postretirement plans to 7.20 for 2023. DTE Energy believes these rates are reasonable assumptions for the long-term rates of return on the plans' assets for 2023 given their respective asset allocations and DTE Energy's capital market expectations. DTE Energy will continue to evaluate the actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually. 
 DTE Energy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. Current accounting rules provide that the MRV of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the pension plans, DTE Energy uses a calculated value when determining the MRV of the pension plan assets and recognizes changes in fair value over a three-year period. Accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Unfavorable asset performance in 2022 resulted in unrecognized net losses. As of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy had 895 million of cumulative losses related to investment performance in prior years that were not yet recognized in the calculation of the MRV of pension assets. For other postretirement benefit plans, DTE Energy uses fair value when determining the MRV of plan assets; therefore, all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of MRV for these plans. 
 The discount rate that DTE Energy utilizes for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to the plans. The discount rate determined on this basis was 5.19 for both the pension and other postretirement plans at December 31, 2022 compared to 2.91 for both the pension and other postretirement plans at December 31, 2021. 
 DTE Energy periodically changes its mortality assumptions to reflect any updated projection scales published by the Society of Actuaries. The mortality assumptions used at December 31, 2022 are the PRI-2012 mortality table projected to 2018 using Scale MP-2019, and projected forward from 2018 using Scale MP-2021 with generational projection. The base mortality tables vary by type of plan, employee's union status and employment status, with additional adjustments to reflect the actual experience and credibility of each population. 
 DTE Energy estimates a total pension credit of approximately 70 million for 2023, compared to the total pension cost of 123 million in 2022. The expected change is primarily related to one-time settlement charges in 2022 that are not expected to occur in 2023, along with a higher discount rate and higher expected rate of return on plan assets. The 2023 other postretirement benefit credit is estimated at approximately 40 million compared to 66 million in 2022. The expected decrease in the credit is primarily due to recognition of asset returns that were less than expected, partially offset by a higher discount rate and higher expected rate of return on plan assets. 
 The health care trend rates for DTE Energy assume 6.75 for pre-65 participants and 7.25 for post-65 participants for 2023, trending down to 4.50 for both pre-65 and post-65 participants in 2035. 
 Future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates, and various other factors related to plan design. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets by one percentage point would have increased the 2022 pension costs by approximately 51 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased the 2022 pension costs by approximately 21 million. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased the 2022 other postretirement credit by approximately 20 million. Lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have decreased the 2022 other postretirement credit by approximately 13 million. 
 The value of the qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was 5.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 7.5 billion at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, DTE Energy's qualified pension plans were underfunded by 282 million and its other postretirement benefit plans were over-funded by 284 million. In 2022, the funded status of the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans remained relatively stable, as significant losses in plan assets were largely offset by increases in discount rates. 
 Pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets. Any required pension funding will be made by contributing amounts consistent with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. DTE Energy did not make contributions to its qualified pension plans in 2022 or 2021, and does not anticipate making any such contributions in 2023. DTE Gas transferred 50 million of qualified pension plan funds to DTE Electric in 2022 in exchange for cash consideration, and anticipates transferring up to 50 million again in 2023. DTE Energy does not expect a material amount of contributions to its qualified pension plans over the next five years. DTE Energy did not make other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2022 or 2021 and does not anticipate making any contributions to the other postretirement plans in 2023 or over the next five years. All planned contributions will be at the discretion of management and subject to any changes in financial market conditions. 
 See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Retirement Benefits and Trusteed Assets." 
 Legal Reserves 
 The Registrants are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Registrants regularly assess their liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters and establish reserves when appropriate. Legal reserves are based upon the Registrants' management s assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against the Registrants. 
 Accounting for Tax Obligations 
 The Registrants are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion, and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales and use, and employment-related taxes, and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters. 
 Accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. The Registrants also assess their ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry-forwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Registrants believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are appropriate. The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements, and such adjustments could be material.

 FAIR VALUE 
 Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities. Contracts DTE Energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, some environmental contracts, and certain forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Items DTE Energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, storage assets, and some environmental contracts. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value" and "Financial and Other Derivative Instruments," respectively. 
 The tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts, and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting. Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in the Registrants' reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement. 
 The Registrants manage their MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, the Registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year). 
 The Registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value." 
 The following table provides details on changes in DTE Energy's MTM net asset (or liability) position:

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Price Risk 
 The Electric and Gas businesses have commodity price risk, primarily related to the purchases of coal, natural gas, uranium, and electricity. However, the Registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, as such changes are included in the PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. Earnings may be indirectly impacted if PSCR or GCR charges increase such that it impacts the collectability of receivables and increases uncollectible expense. Refer to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts section below for additional information. 
 Changes in the price of natural gas can also impact the valuation of lost and unaccounted for gas, storage sales, and transportation services revenue at the Gas segment. The Gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long-term storage contracts. The Registrants are exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery. 
 The DTE Vantage segment is subject to price risk for electricity, natural gas, coal products, and environmental attributes generated from its renewable natural gas investments. DTE Energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term contracts and hedging instruments, when available. 
 DTE Energy's Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, environmental, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations. These risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options, and futures contracts, within predetermined risk parameters. 
 Credit Risk 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 The Registrants regularly review contingent matters, existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The Registrants manage this risk by working at the state and federal levels to promote funding programs for low-income customers, providing energy assistance programs and support, and promoting timely customer payments through adherence to MPSC billing practice rules relating to payment arrangements, energy disconnects, and restores. 
 Trading Activities 
 DTE Energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. DTE Energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties. 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 The following table displays the credit quality of DTE Energy's trading counterparties as of December 31, 2022:

 (a) This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) or BBB- assigned by Standard Poor s Rating Group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard Poor s). The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 13 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (b) This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 2 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (c) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody s or Standard Poor s but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy s evaluation of the counterparty s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 17 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (d) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody s or Standard Poor s and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy s evaluation of the counterparty s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 1 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 Other 
 The Registrants engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade. The Registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs, request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt. In order to manage interest costs, DTE Energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. DTE Energy's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates, credit spreads, and SOFR. As of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy had floating rate debt of 2.0 billion and a floating rate debt-to-total debt ratio of 10.4 . 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power, as well as for long-term transportation capacity. To limit DTE Energy's exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, DTE Energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through December 2032. 
 Summary of Sensitivity Analyses 
 Sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for DTE Energy and long-term debt obligations for the Registrants. The commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities. The sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values. The hypothetical losses related to long-term debt would be realized only if DTE Energy transferred all of its fixed-rate long-term debt to other creditors.

 DTE Energy Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Management of DTE Energy carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of DTE Energy's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of DTE Energy's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022, which is the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by DTE Energy in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to DTE Energy's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any disclosure controls and procedures, management cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of its disclosure controls and procedures will be attained. 
 (b) Management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
 Management of DTE Energy is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, DTE Energy's CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management of DTE Energy has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Energy s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 The effectiveness of DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who also audited DTE Energy's financial statements, as stated in their report which appears herein. 
 (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Energy's internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DTE Energy Company 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Energy Company and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 54

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Accounting for the Effects of New, or Changes to Existing, Regulatory Matters 
 As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded 4,542 million of regulatory assets and 2,707 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The Company is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services and be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes could result in a discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Company s regulated businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company's accounting for the effects of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the potential outcome and resulting accounting implications of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in evaluating the appropriateness of management s assessment and audit evidence obtained related to the assessment. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment and implementation of new regulatory matters or changes to existing regulatory matters. These procedures also included, among others, assessing (i) the reasonableness of management s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations and (ii) the appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Testing regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate orders, involved considering the provisions and formulas outlined in the rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, and the application of relevant regulatory precedents.

 DTE Electric Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Management of DTE Electric carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of DTE Electric's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of DTE Electric's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022, which is the end of the period covered by this report.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management of DTE Electric has assessed the effectiveness of DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 This annual report does not include an audit report of DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to audit by DTE Electric's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit DTE Electric to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, DTE Electric's internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of DTE Electric Company 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of DTE Electric Company and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholder s equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Accounting for the Effects of New, or Changes to Existing, Regulatory Matters 
 As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded 3,846 million of regulatory assets and 1,811 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The Company is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services and be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes could result in a discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of the Company s regulated businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment.

 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company's accounting for the effects of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the potential outcome and resulting accounting implications of new, or changes to existing, regulatory matters; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in evaluating the appropriateness of management s assessment and audit evidence obtained related to the assessment. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment and implementation of new regulatory matters or changes to existing regulatory matters. These procedures also included, among others, assessing (i) the reasonableness of management s assessment of impacts arising from correspondence with regulators and changes in laws and regulations and (ii) the appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Testing regulatory assets and liabilities, including those subject to pending rate orders, involved considering the provisions and formulas outlined in the rate orders, other regulatory correspondence, and the application of relevant regulatory precedents.

 material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Energy's variable interests through these long-term purchase and sale contracts. In addition, there is material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Electric's variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts. 
 In the first quarter 2022, DTE Electric financed regulatory assets for previously deferred costs related to the River Rouge generation plant and tree trimming surge program through the sale of bonds by a wholly-owned special purpose entity, DTE Securitization. DTE Securitization is a VIE. DTE Electric has the power to direct the most significant activities of DTE Securitization, including performing servicing activities such as billing and collecting surcharge revenue. Accordingly, DTE Electric is the primary beneficiary and DTE Securitization is consolidated by the Registrants. Securitization bond holders have no recourse to the Registrants' assets, except for those held by DTE Securitization. Surcharges collected by DTE Electric to pay for bond servicing and other qualified costs reflect securitization property solely owned by DTE Securitization. These surcharges are remitted to a trustee and are not available to other creditors of the Registrants. 
 The maximum risk exposure for consolidated VIEs is reflected on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For non-consolidated VIEs, the maximum risk exposure of the Registrants is generally limited to their investment, notes receivable, and future funding commitments.

 Equity Method Investments 
 Investments in non-consolidated affiliates that are not controlled by the Registrants, but over which they have significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Certain of the equity method investees are also considered VIEs and disclosed in the non-consolidated VIEs table above. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, DTE Energy's Investments in equity method investees were million and million, respectively. The balances are primarily comprised of investments in the DTE Vantage and Corporate and Other segments, of which no investment is individually significant. DTE Vantage investments include projects that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to industrial customers, sell electricity from renewable energy projects under long-term power purchase agreements, and produce and sell metallurgical coke. Corporate and Other holds various ownership interests in limited partnerships that include investment funds supporting regional development and economic growth. For further information by segment, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Segment and Related Information." 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, DTE Energy's share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investees exceeded the carrying amounts of Investments in equity method investees by million for both periods. The difference is being amortized over the life of the underlying assets.

 The Registrants monitor the credit quality of their financing receivables on a regular basis by reviewing credit quality indicators and monitoring for trigger events, such as a credit rating downgrade or bankruptcy. Credit quality indicators include, but are not limited to, ratings by credit agencies where available, collection history, collateral, counterparty financial statements and other internal metrics. Utilizing such data, the Registrants have determined three internal grades of credit quality. Internal grade 1 includes financing receivables for counterparties where credit rating agencies have ranked the counterparty as investment grade. To the extent credit ratings are not available, the Registrants utilize other credit quality indicators to determine the level of risk associated with the financing receivable. Internal grade 1 may include financing receivables for counterparties for which credit rating agencies have ranked the counterparty as below investment grade; however, due to favorable information on other credit quality indicators, the Registrants have determined the risk level to be similar to that of an investment grade counterparty. Internal grade 2 includes financing receivables for counterparties with limited credit information and those with a higher risk profile based upon credit quality indicators. Internal grade 3 reflects financing receivables for which the counterparties have the greatest level of risk, including those in bankruptcy status.

 The allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable for the utility entities is generally calculated using an aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. DTE Electric and DTE Gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management's assessment of existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors. Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action. DTE Electric and DTE Gas generally assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on past-due terms with customers. Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted. The time period for write-off is days after service has been terminated. 
 The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for non-utility businesses and other receivables for both utility and non-utility businesses is generally calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances generally in excess of days. Existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors are also considered. Receivables are written off on a specific identification basis and determined based upon the specific circumstances of the associated receivable. 
 Notes receivable for DTE Energy are primarily comprised of finance lease receivables and loans that are included in Notes Receivable and Other current assets on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Notes receivable for DTE Electric are primarily comprised of loans. 
 Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from to days. The Registrants cease accruing interest (nonaccrual status), consider a note receivable impaired, and establish an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable. In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable, the Registrants consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterparty's ability to pay including existing and future economic conditions. 
 Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to the contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal. Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.

 Nature of Goods and Services 
 The following is a description of principal activities, separated by reportable segments, from which DTE Energy generates revenue. For more detailed information about reportable segments, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Related Information. 
 The Registrants have contracts with customers which may contain more than one performance obligation. When more than one performance obligation exists in a contract, the consideration under the contract is allocated to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price. DTE Energy generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or the use of the adjusted market assessment approach. The adjusted market assessment approach involves the evaluation of the market in which DTE Energy sells goods or services and estimating the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay. 
 Under Topic 606, when a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the product or service provided, revenue is considered to be recognized over time. Alternatively, if it is determined that the criteria for recognition of revenue over time is not met, the revenue is considered to be recognized at a point in time. 
 85

 days following billing. 
 Energy Trading 
 Energy Trading revenues consist primarily of derivative contracts outside of the scope of Topic 606. For performance obligations within the scope of Topic 606, the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon when control over the associated product or service is transferred. 
 Revenues, including estimated unbilled amounts, within the scope of Topic 606 arising from the sale of natural gas, electricity, power capacity, and other energy related products are generally recognized over time based upon volumes delivered or through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service. DTE Energy has determined that the above methods represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of control to the customer. Revenues are known at the time of recognition. Payment for the aforementioned revenues is generally due from customers in the month following delivery.

 Increases due to cash received or receivable, excluding amounts recognized as revenue during the period Revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period ) Ending Balance, December 31, 2022 
 The deferred revenues at DTE Energy generally represent amounts paid by or receivables from customers for which the associated performance obligation has not yet been satisfied. Deferred revenues include amounts associated with REC performance obligations under certain wholesale full requirements power contracts. Deferred revenues associated with RECs are recognized as revenue when control of the RECs has transferred. Other performance obligations associated with deferred revenues include providing products and services related to customer prepayments. Deferred revenues associated with these products and services are recognized when control has transferred to the customer. 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 and thereafter 
 Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations 
 In accordance with optional exemptions available under Topic 606, the Registrants did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (2) with the exception of fixed consideration, contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Registrants have the right to invoice for goods provided and services performed, and (3) contracts for which variable consideration relates entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation. 
 Such contracts consist of varying types of performance obligations across the segments, including the supply and delivery of energy related products and services. Contracts with variable volumes and/or variable pricing, including those with pricing provisions tied to a consumer price or other index, have also been excluded as the related consideration under the contract is variable at inception of the contract. Contract lengths vary from cancellable to multi-year.

 billion of the Asset retirement obligations represent nuclear decommissioning liabilities that are funded through a surcharge to electric customers over the life of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant. The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and requires minimum decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi 2. Rates approved by the MPSC provide for the recovery of decommissioning costs of Fermi 2 and the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. DTE Electric believes the MPSC collections will be adequate to fund the estimated cost of decommissioning. The decommissioning assets, anticipated earnings thereon, and future revenues from decommissioning collections will be used to decommission Fermi 2. DTE Electric expects the liabilities to be reduced to at the conclusion of the decommissioning activities. If amounts remain in the trust funds for Fermi 2 following the completion of the decommissioning activities, those amounts will be disbursed based on rulings by the MPSC and FERC. 
 A portion of the funds recovered through the Fermi 2 decommissioning surcharge and deposited in external trust accounts is designated for the removal of non-radioactive assets and returning the site to greenfield. This removal and greenfielding is not considered a legal liability. Therefore, it is not included in the asset retirement obligation, but is reflected as the Nuclear decommissioning liability. The decommissioning of Fermi 1 is funded by DTE Electric. Contributions to the Fermi 1 trust are discretionary. For additional discussion of Nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value."

 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending October 31, 2023. The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to an increase in net plant resulting from generation and distribution investments, as well as related increases to depreciation and property tax expenses. The rate filing also requested an increase in return on equity from to and included projected changes in sales. 
 On November 18, 2022, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual revenue increase of million for services rendered on or after November 25, 2022 and a return on equity of . The order also disallowed certain capital expenditures previously recorded, for which million has been recorded to Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The annual revenue increase of million granted in the order included a higher residential sales forecast adopted by the MPSC compared to the DTE Electric projections in the rate case filing. DTE Electric believes the MPSC forecast did not provide sufficient consideration for recent downward trends in residential sales as the temporary increases from the COVID-19 pandemic began diminishing in 2022. Accordingly, DTE Electric filed a petition for rehearing on December 16, 2022 requesting the MPSC to reconsider and adopt an alternate residential sales forecast that more accurately reflects changing trends in customer usage and is consistent with previously authorized forecast methodologies. 
 On February 2, 2023, DTE Electric received an order from the MPSC that denied the rehearing request. DTE Electric is seeking additional rate relief in its 2023 rate case filing that will include projected changes in sales. Refer to the "2023 Electric Rate Case Filing" section below for additional details. 
 Ludington Accounting Application 
 During April 2022, DTE Electric and Consumers Energy Company Consumers filed a complaint against Toshiba America Energy Systems TAES and its parent corporation for unsatisfactory performance relating to the overhaul and upgrade of the Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage Plant Ludington ). Refer to the Ludington Plant Contract Dispute section of Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information regarding the complaint and ongoing legal proceedings. 
 DTE Electric and Consumers, joint owners of Ludington, believe that certain costs must be incurred in the near term for repairing and/or replacing defective work performed by TAES in order to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of the plant. In November 2022, DTE Electric and Consumers filed an accounting application with the MPSC for authority to defer these costs as a regulatory asset. DTE Electric and Consumers are seeking the regulatory asset for their respective and shares of these costs, to be offset by any potential litigation proceeds. The parties are also seeking that appropriate recovery and ratemaking treatment may be granted in a future rate case or other proceeding. A response in this filing is currently expected in the first quarter 2023. 
 2022 DTE Gas Voluntary Refund Application 
 On November 4, 2022, DTE Gas filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval of a one-time voluntary refund to its utility customers not to exceed million, as well as authorization to implement accounting procedures consistent with the refund. The requested refund was due to 2022 financial results, that due to unforeseen circumstances, were expected to exceed those that were initially anticipated. DTE Gas expects the refund will be made in the form of incurring costs that benefit its customers and are incremental to those included in current rates. If such costs are not incurred, the refund will be administered through a bill credit. 
 On December 9, 2022, the MPSC issued an order approving the application and directed DTE Gas to file documentation by December 27, 2022 substantiating the final amount of the customer refund. DTE Gas complied with this request and submitted a letter to the MPSC substantiating a refund amount of million. On December 28, 2022, the MPSC confirmed that DTE Gas complied with the requirement set forth in the December 9th order. Accordingly, DTE Gas recognized a regulatory liability of million and has until February 28, 2023 to confirm the proposed method of the refund.

 The unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the electricity and natural gas commodity types consist of inputs that are less observable due in part to lack of available broker quotes, supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date or are based on internally developed models. Certain basis prices (i.e., the difference in pricing between two locations) included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable. The weighted average price for unobservable inputs was calculated using the average of forward price curves for natural gas and electricity and the absolute value of monthly volumes. 
 The inputs listed above would have had a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted. A significant increase (decrease) in the basis price would have resulted in a higher (lower) fair value for long positions, with offsetting impacts to short positions.

 Derivative Activities 
 DTE Energy manages its MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, it records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year). The following describes the categories of activities represented by their operating characteristics and key risks: 
 Asset Optimization Represents derivative activity associated with assets owned and contracted by DTE Energy, including forward natural gas purchases and sales, natural gas transportation, and storage capacity. Changes in the value of derivatives in this category typically economically offset changes in the value of underlying non-derivative positions, which do not qualify for fair value accounting. The difference in accounting treatment of derivatives in this category and the underlying non-derivative positions can result in significant earnings volatility. 
 Marketing and Origination Represents derivative activity transacted by originating substantially hedged positions with wholesale energy marketers, producers, end-users, utilities, retail aggregators, and alternative energy suppliers. 
 Fundamentals Based Trading Represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of taking a view, capturing market price changes, or putting capital at risk. This activity is speculative in nature as opposed to hedging an existing exposure. 
 Other Includes derivative activity at DTE Electric related to FTRs. Changes in the value of derivative contracts at DTE Electric are recorded as Derivative assets or liabilities, with an offset to Regulatory assets or liabilities as the settlement value of these contracts will be included in the PSCR mechanism when realized.

Such balances of letters of credit are excluded from the tables below and are not netted with the recognized assets and liabilities in DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 For contracts with certain clearing agents, the fair value of derivative instruments is netted against realized positions with the net balance reflected as either 1) a Derivative asset or liability or 2) an Account receivable or payable. Other than certain clearing agents, Accounts receivable and Accounts payable that are subject to netting arrangements have not been offset against the fair value of Derivative assets and liabilities.

 Various subsidiaries of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific. For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, DTE Energy had billion of derivatives in net liability positions, for which hard triggers exist. There is million of collateral that has been posted against such liabilities, including cash and letters of credit. Associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were billion. The net remaining amount of million is derived from the million noted above.

 In June 2022, DTE Energy entered into a billion unsecured term loan with a maturity date of December 2023. Any borrowings on the loan were determined to be long-term debt, as the term of the facility exceeds one year. DTE Energy had mandatory draw obligations of at least million within sixty days of closing and a total of million within six months of closing. DTE Energy complied with these obligations, as noted in the table above. These draws are included in the current portion of long-term debt on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022. Borrowings under the term loan are for the general corporate purposes of DTE Energy and its subsidiaries, bearing interest at SOFR plus per annum. Any unused capacity under the loan will terminate if not drawn by June 24, 2023. 
 Other terms of the loan are consistent with DTE Energy's unsecured revolving credit agreements. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Short-Term Credit Arrangements and Borrowings," for additional information regarding the unsecured revolving credit agreements.

 Junior Subordinated Debentures 
 DTE Energy has the right to defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. Should DTE Energy exercise this right, it cannot declare or pay dividends on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period. Any deferred interest payments will bear additional interest at the rate associated with the related debt issue. As of December 31, 2022, no interest payments have been deferred on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. 
 Cross Default Provisions 
 Substantially all of the net utility properties of DTE Electric and DTE Gas are subject to the lien of mortgages. Should DTE Electric or DTE Gas fail to timely pay their indebtedness under these mortgages, such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy. 
 Remarketable Senior Notes 
 In November 2019, DTE Energy issued billion of equity units, initially in the form of Corporate Units. Each Corporate Unit consisted of a stock purchase contract and a 1/20 interest in a RSN issued by DTE Energy. The stock purchase contracts obligated the holders to purchase shares of DTE Energy's common stock at a future settlement date. The RSNs were pledged as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts. 
 In August 2022, DTE Energy remarketed the billion 2019 Series F RSNs pursuant to the terms of the 2019 equity units. DTE Energy elected to pull forward the maturity of the notes to November 1, 2024, compared to the original maturity date of November 1, 2025. As a result of the remarketing, the interest rate was reset to , payable semi-annually at the new rate beginning August 8, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the notes are included in Mortgage, bonds, notes and other within DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 DTE Energy did not receive any proceeds for the remarketing. All proceeds belonged to the investors holding the 2019 equity units and were temporarily used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities. The securities were released on behalf of investors on the related stock purchase contracts settlement date of November 1, 2022 to pay the purchase price to DTE Energy for the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock. The proceeds DTE Energy received from the settlement of the purchase contract were primarily used to retire billion of maturing debt on November 1, 2022.

 million letter of credit facility to million and amended the maturity date from July 2023 to June 2023. The facility will support general corporate purposes and has terms consistent with the unsecured revolving credit agreements. 
 The unsecured revolving credit agreements, as amended in October 2022, require a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than to 1 for DTE Energy and to 1 for DTE Electric and DTE Gas. In the agreements, "total funded debt" means all indebtedness of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries, including finance lease obligations, hedge agreements, and guarantees of third parties debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt, and certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain DTE Gas short-term debt. "Capitalization" means the sum of (a) total funded debt plus (b) "consolidated net worth," which is equal to consolidated total equity of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries (excluding pension effects under certain FASB statements), as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At December 31, 2022, the total funded debt to total capitalization ratios for DTE Energy, DTE Electric, and DTE Gas were to 1, to 1, and to 1, respectively, and were in compliance with this financial covenant.

 and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For DTE Electric, the weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For information related to affiliate short-term borrowings, refer to Note 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Related Party Transactions." 
 In conjunction with maintaining certain exchange-traded risk management positions, DTE Energy may be required to post collateral with a clearing agent. DTE Energy has a demand financing agreement with its clearing agent which allows the right of setoff with posted collateral. At December 31, 2022, the capacity under the facility was million. The amounts outstanding under demand financing agreements were million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were fully offset by posted collateral. 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 Certain of DTE Energy s credit facilities contain a provision requiring DTE Energy to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, of no more than to 1, which has the effect of limiting the amount of dividends DTE Energy can pay in order to maintain compliance with this provision. At December 31, 2022, the effect of this provision was a restriction on dividend payments to no more than billion of DTE Energy's Retained earnings of billion. There are other effective limitations with respect to DTE Energy s ability to pay dividends. 

NOTE 17 
 to years. Leases at DTE Electric are primarily comprised of various forms of equipment, computer hardware, coal railcars, and certain easement leases with terms ranging from approximately to years. 
 A lease is deemed to exist when the Registrants have the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment, as conveyed through a contract, for a certain period of time and consideration paid. The right to control is deemed to occur when the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified assets and the right to direct the use of such assets. 
 Lease liabilities are determined utilizing a discount rate to determine the present values of lease payments. Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease when it is readily determinable. When the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the incremental borrowing rate is used. The Registrants have determined their respective incremental borrowing rates based upon the rate of interest that would have been paid on a collateralized basis over similar tenors to that of the leases. The incremental borrowing rates for DTE Electric and DTE Gas have been determined utilizing respective secured borrowing rates for first mortgage bonds with like tenors of remaining lease terms. Incremental borrowing rates for non-utility entities have been determined utilizing an implied secured borrowing rate based upon an unsecured rate for a similar tenor of remaining lease terms, which is then adjusted for the estimated impact of collateral. 
 Certain leases of the Registrants contain escalation clauses whereby the payments are adjusted for consumer price or labor indices. DTE Energy has leases with non-index based escalation clauses for fixed dollar or percentage increases. DTE Electric has leases with non-index based escalation clauses for fixed dollar increases. DTE Energy also has leases with variable payments based upon usage of, or revenues associated with, the leased assets. DTE Electric also has leases with variable payments based upon the usage of the leased assets. 
 Certain leases of easements and coal railcars contain provisions whereby the Registrants have the option to terminate the lease agreement by giving notice of such termination during the time frames specified in the respective lease. The Registrants have considered such provisions in the determination of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the lease would be terminated. 
 The Registrants have certain leases which contain purchase options. Based upon the nature of the leased property and terms of the purchase options, the Registrants have determined it is not reasonably certain that such purchase options will be utilized. Thus, the impact of the purchase options has not been included in the determination of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the subject leases.

 During the third quarter 2022, DTE Energy completed construction of and began operating energy infrastructure assets for another large industrial customer in Canada. Under the long-term agreement, the customer will have the option to purchase the assets at the end of the initial contract term in 2042. The customer may also elect to extend the term in year increments and may purchase the assets during the extension period. DTE Energy has accounted for a portion of the agreement as a finance lease arrangement, recognizing an additional net investment of million, subject to foreign currency translation adjustments. 
 DTE Energy also leases various assets under operating leases for a pipeline, energy facilities and related equipment. Such leases are comprised of both fixed payments and variable payments which are contingent on volumes, with terms ranging from to years. Generally, the operating leases do not have renewal provisions or options to purchase the assets at the end of the lease. The operating leases generally do not have termination for convenience provisions. Termination may be allowed under specific circumstances stated in the lease contract, such as under an event of default. 
 Certain of the finance and operating leases have lease terms that extend to the end of the estimated economic life of the leased assets, thereby resulting in no residual value. Any remaining residual values under the finance and operating leases are expected to be recovered through rates, renewals or new lease contracts. Residual values have been determined using the estimated economic life of the leased assets. The finance and operating leases do not contain residual value guarantees. 
 Certain of the operating leases have both lease and non-lease components. The lease and non-lease components are allocated based upon estimated relative standalone selling prices.

 emissions by 2050. 
 In addition to the GHG standards for existing EGUs, in December 2018, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the carbon dioxide performance standards for new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel fired EGUs. The rule was finalized on January 13, 2021 and immediately challenged. An order vacating the rule was filed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 5, 2021. The carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on DTE Electric, since DTE Electric has no plans to build new coal-fired generation and any potential new, modified, or reconstructed gas generation is expected to be able to comply with the respective standards. 
 Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers. Potential impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC. 
 To comply with air pollution requirements, DTE Electric has spent approximately billion. DTE Electric does t anticipate additional capital expenditures for air pollution requirements, subject to the results of future rulemakings. 
 Water In response to EPA regulations and in accordance with the Clean Water Act section 316(b), DTE Electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. A final rule became effective in October 2014 which required studies to be completed and submitted as part of the NPDES permit application process to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish. DTE Electric has completed the required studies and submitted reports for most of its generation plants, and a final study is in-process for Monroe power plant. Final compliance for the installation of any required technology to reduce the impacts of water intake structures will be determined by the state on a case by case, site specific basis. DTE Electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the State of Michigan on determining whether any controls are needed. These evaluations/studies may require modifications to some existing intake structures. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this rule making at this time. 
 As part of the Monroe power plant NPDES permit, EGLE has added requirements to evaluate the thermal discharge of the facility as it relates to Clean Water Act section 316(a) regulations. DTE Electric will evaluate the impacts of the thermal discharge on a balanced indigenous biological community and submit a biological demonstration study plan to EGLE. After approval by EGLE and completion of field sampling, data will be processed and compiled into a comprehensive report. At the present time, DTE Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation or financial impact.

 former MGP sites. Cleanup of one of the MGP sites is complete, and that site is closed. The investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each MGP site. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and above ground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, DTE Electric had million and million, respectively, accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electric s financial position and cash flows. DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015, and was revised in August 2016, July 2018, August 2020, and November 2020. The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards. DTE Electric owns and operates permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants subject to certain provisions in the CCR rule. At certain facilities, the rule currently requires ongoing sampling and testing of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant. 
 On August 28, 2020, the CCR rule "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure and Enhancing Public Access to Information" was published in the Federal Register and required all unlined impoundments (including units previously classified as "clay-lined") to initiate closure as soon as technically feasible, but no later than April 11, 2021. Additionally, the rule amends certain reporting requirements and CCR website requirements. On November 12, 2020, an additional revision to the CCR Rule "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternate Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments" was published in the Federal Register that provides a process to determine if certain unlined impoundments consisting of an alternative liner system may be as protective as the current liners specified in the CCR rule, and therefore may continue to operate. 
 DTE Electric submitted applications to the EPA that support continued use of all impoundments through their active lives. The forced closure date of April 11, 2021 was effectively delayed, pending the EPA completing review of the applications. On September 1, 2022, DTE Electric ceased receipt of CCR and non-CCR waste streams at the St. Clair power plant bottom ash basins and initiated closure. Therefore, DTE Electric withdrew the Part A rule demonstration for St. Clair, as it was no longer necessary for the EPA to issue an extension of the April 11, 2021 deadline to cease receipt of waste. 
 On January 25, 2023, DTE Electric received notice of the EPA's proposed denial of Part B applications. DTE Electric will provide additional information to the EPA in the public comment period. If the EPA's final decision remains unchanged, DTE Electric does not expect the denied applications to have a significant operational or financial impact; however, DTE Electric is continuing to review and analyze potential outcomes of this matter. 
 At the State level, legislation was signed by the Governor in December 2018 and provides for further regulation of the CCR program in Michigan. Additionally, the statutory revision provides the basis of a CCR program that EGLE has submitted to the EPA for approval to fully regulate the CCR program in Michigan in lieu of a Federal permit program. The EPA is currently working with EGLE in reviewing the submitted State program, and DTE Electric will work with EGLE to implement the State program that may be approved in the future. 
 On April 12, 2017, the EPA granted a petition for reconsideration of the 2015 ELG Rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA finalized the ELG Reconsideration Rule which revised the regulations from the 2015 ELG rule for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water only. The Reconsideration Rule re-establishes the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards applicable to FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water. The EPA set the applicability dates for bottom ash transport water "as soon as possible" beginning October 13, 2021 and no later than December 31, 2025. FGD wastewater retrofits must be completed "as soon as possible" beginning October 13, 2021 and no later than December 31, 2025 or December 31, 2028 if a permittee decides to pursue the Voluntary Incentives Program (VIP) subcategory for FGD wastewater. If a facility applies for the VIP, they must meet more stringent standards, but are allowed an extended time period to meet the compliance requirements.

 DTE Gas 
 Contaminated and Other Sites DTE Gas owns or previously owned former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Cleanup of MGP sites is complete and those sites are closed. DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of additional sites. Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years. The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, DTE Gas had million and million, respectively, accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows. DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations. 
 Non-utility 
 DTE Energy's non-utility businesses are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations dealing with the protection of the environment from various pollutants. 
 In March 2019, the EPA issued an FOV to EES Coke Battery, LLC ("EES Coke"), the Michigan coke battery facility that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy, alleging that the 2008 and 2014 permits issued by EGLE did not comply with the Clean Air Act. In September 2020, the EPA issued another FOV alleging EES Coke's 2018 and 2019 SO2 emissions exceeded projections and hence violated non-attainment new source review permitting requirements. EES Coke evaluated the EPA's alleged violations and believes that the permits approved by EGLE complied with the Clean Air Act. EES Coke responded to the EPA's September 2020 allegations demonstrating its actual emissions are compliant with non-attainment new source review requirements. On June 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against EES Coke in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that EES Coke failed to comply with non-attainment new source review requirements under the Clean Air Act when it applied for the 2014 permit. In November 2022, the Sierra Club and City of River Rouge were granted intervention. At the present time, DTE Energy cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter. 
 Separately, in December 2021, EGLE issued a Notice of Violation to EES Coke alleging excess visible emissions from pushing operations. In January 2022, EES Coke provided EGLE a response describing the corrective actions taken to prevent future recurrences. At the present time, EES Coke cannot predict the outcome or financial impact of this matter.

 Ludington Plant Contract Dispute 
 DTE Electric and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers"), joint owners of the Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage plant ("Ludington"), are parties to a 2010 engineering, procurement, and construction contract with Toshiba America Energy Systems ("TAES"), under which TAES is charged with performing a major overhaul and upgrade of Ludington. TAES' performance has been unsatisfactory and resulted in overhaul project delays. DTE Electric and Consumers have demanded that TAES provide a comprehensive plan to resolve quality control concerns, including adherence to its warranty commitments and other contractual obligations. DTE Electric and Consumers have taken extensive efforts to resolve these issues with TAES, including a formal demand to TAES' parent, Toshiba Corporation, under a parent guaranty it provided in the contract. TAES has not provided a comprehensive plan or otherwise met its performance obligations. In order to enforce the contract, DTE Electric and Consumers filed a complaint against TAES and Toshiba Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2022. 
 In June 2022, TAES and Toshiba Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, along with counterclaims seeking approximately million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties' contract. During September 2022, the motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. DTE Electric believes the outstanding counterclaims are without merit, but would be liable for of the damages if approved. In October 2022, the combined parties submitted a joint discovery plan to proceed with the litigation process and a potential trial during the second half of 2024. DTE Electric cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. 
 Refer to the Ludington Accounting Application section within Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Regulatory Matters," for additional information regarding costs to address TAES defective work and potential regulatory accounting treatment.

 On December 20, 2019, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 was signed, extending TRIA through December 31, 2027. For multiple terrorism losses caused by acts of terrorism not covered under the TRIA occurring within after the first loss from terrorism, the NEIL policies would make available to all insured entities up to billion, plus any amounts recovered from reinsurance, government indemnity, or other sources to cover losses. 
 Under NEIL policies, DTE Electric could be liable for maximum assessments of up to million per event if the loss associated with any one event at any nuclear plant should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL. 
 Public Liability Insurance 
 As required by federal law, DTE Electric maintains million of public liability insurance for a nuclear incident. Further, under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005, deferred premium charges up to million could be levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than million per year per facility. Thus, deferred premium charges could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities. 
 Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs 
 In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, DTE Electric has a contract with the DOE for the future storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2 that required DTE Electric to pay the DOE a fee of mill per kWh of Fermi 2 electricity generated and sold. The fee was a component of nuclear fuel expense. The mill per kWh DOE fee was reduced to effective May 16, 2014.

 DTE Electric participates in various plans that provide pension and other postretirement benefits for DTE Energy and its affiliates. The plans are primarily sponsored by the LLC. DTE Electric accounts for its participation in DTE Energy's qualified and non-qualified pension plans by applying multiemployer accounting. DTE Electric accounts for its participation in other postretirement benefit plans by applying multiple-employer accounting. Within multiemployer and multiple-employer plans, participants pool plan assets for investment purposes and to reduce the cost of plan administration. The primary difference between plan types is that assets contributed in multiemployer plans can be used to provide benefits for all participating employers, while assets contributed within a multiple-employer plan are restricted for use by the contributing employer.

 The decrease in DTE Energy's pension benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an actuarial gain driven by an increase in discount rates, as well as settlements arising from higher lump-sum payments to retirees during the year. The decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2021 was primarily due to an actuarial gain driven by an increase in discount rates. 
 The Registrants policy is to fund pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and additional amounts when it deems appropriate. In 2022, DTE Gas transferred million of qualified pension plan funds to DTE Electric in exchange for cash consideration. There were no other transfers or contributions made to the qualified pension plans in 2022 and 2021. DTE Energy and DTE Electric had contributions of million and million in 2020, respectively. 
 DTE Energy anticipates an additional transfer of up to million of qualified pension plan funds from DTE Gas to DTE Electric in 2023. DTE Energy does anticipate making any contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2023, subject to management discretion and any changes in financial market conditions.

 DTE Energy employs a formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various asset classes. Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income, and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term. Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks, and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment management, and rebalancing. Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. As a result of this process, the Registrants have a long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plans of for 2023. The Registrants believe this rate is a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets given the current investment strategy. 
 The DTE Energy Company Affiliates Employee Benefit Plans Master Trust employs a liability driven investment program whereby the characteristics of plan liabilities are considered when determining investment policy. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and large and small market capitalizations. Fixed income investments generally include U.S. Treasuries, other governmental debt, diversified corporate bonds, bank loans, and mortgage-backed securities. Other investments are used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and/or reduce portfolio investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
