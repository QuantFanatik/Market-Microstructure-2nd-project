 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the recovery of the travel and hospitality industry from the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic (the "COVID-19 pandemic" or the "pandemic"), the performance of our business, our future financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "could," "seeks," "projects," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements, including, among others, those described under "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" and under "Summary of Risk Factors" below. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Summary of Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business. A summary of the principal factors that create risk in investing in our securities and might cause actual results to differ from expectations is set forth below : 
 
 We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth ; 
 
 Macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services ; 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and COVID-19 or other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments may negatively affect future results; 
 
 Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively ; 
 
 Our business is subject to risks related to doing business with third-party property owners that could adversely affect our reputation, operational results or prospects for growth; 
 
 Failures in, material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites, including as a result of cyber-attacks on our systems or systems operated by third parties that provide operational and technical services to us, costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations ; 
 
 The growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability ; 
 
 Because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States ("U.S."), the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business ; 
 
 Labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations; 
 
 2 

Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters, that could expose us to numerous risks; and 
 
 Our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts, and could require us to divert our cash flows from operations to make required debt or interest payments . 
 
 These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present material risks. 

Terms Used and Basis of Presentation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K 
 
 Except where the context requires otherwise, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "Hilton," "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., together with all of its consolidated subsidiaries.

Hilton did not retain any interest in Park or HGV, but did enter into long-term management and franchise contracts with Park for the portfolio of hotels and resorts that it held at the time of the spin-offs and a 100-year license agreement with HGV for the timeshare business.

Item 1. Business 
 
 Overview 
 
 Hilton is one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with 7,165 properties comprising 1,127,430 rooms in 123 countries and territories as of December 31, 2022. Founded in 1919, Hilton has been an innovator in the industry for more than 100 years, driven by the vision of founder Conrad Hilton, "to fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality." Our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury hotel brands, Waldorf Astoria Hotels Resorts, LXR Hotels Resorts and Conrad Hotels Resorts; our lifestyle hotel brands, Canopy by Hilton, Curio Collection by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, Tempo by Hilton and Motto by Hilton; our full service hotel brands, Signia by Hilton, Hilton Hotels Resorts and DoubleTree by Hilton; our focused service hotel brands, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton and Tru by Hilton; our all-suites hotel brands, Embassy Suites by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Home2 Suites by Hilton; our new premium economy brand, Spark by Hilton, launched in January 2023; and our timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations. As of December 31, 2022, we had 152 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, Hilton Honors, a 19 percent increase from December 31, 2021; refer to " Our Brand Portfolio" and " Our Guest Loyalty Program" below for additional information on our brands, including Hilton Honors. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry beginning in 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the pervasiveness and severity of travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives have varied by country and state; however, as of December 31, 2022, most of the countries we operate in had eased or completely lifted such restrictions. While the pandemic negatively affected certain of our results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have experienced strong signs of recovery since early 2021, with comparable system-wide RevPAR in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 exceeding levels achieved in the same periods in 2019. Although all periods included in 
 3 

our consolidated financial statements presented in this Form 10-K were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, none of these periods are considered comparable, and no periods affected by the pandemic are expected to be comparable to future periods. 
 
 We operate our business through: (i) a management and franchise segment; and (ii) an ownership segment, each of which is reported as a segment based on (a) delivering a similar set of products and services and (b) being managed separately given its distinct economic characteristics. The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels that license our intellectual property ("IP"), including our brand names, trademarks and service marks, and where we provide other contracted services to third-party owners, but the day-to-day services of the hotels are operated or managed by someone other than us. Revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and HGV for the right to use our IP; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. The ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. For more information regarding our segments, refer to " Our Business Management and Franchise" and " Our Business Ownership" below. 
 
 In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. The following table summarizes our development activity: 
 
 As of or for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Hotels Rooms (1) 
 Hotel system Openings 
 355 58,200 Net additions (2) 
 308 48,300 Development pipeline (3) 
 Additions 
 664 89,900 Count as of period end (4) 
 2,821 416,400 
 ____________ 
 (1) Rounded to the nearest hundred. 
 (2) Represents room additions, net of rooms removed from our system, during the period, which contributed to net unit growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 4.7 percent. 
 (3) Hotels in our system were under development throughout 118 countries and territories, including 30 countries and territories where we did not currently have any existing hotels. 
 (4) In our development pipeline, as of December 31, 2022, 205,400 of the rooms were under construction and 243,500 of the rooms were located outside of the U.S. Nearly all of the rooms in our development pipeline will be in our management and franchise segment. We do not consider any individual development project to be material to us. 
 
 Overall, we believe that our experience in the hospitality industry, which spans more than a century of customer service and entrepreneurship, and continues to evolve to meet the tastes, preferences and demands of our hotel guests; our strong, well-defined brands that operate throughout the hospitality industry chain scales; our diverse, inclusive workforce, built to focus on providing exceptional customer experiences; and our commercial service offerings will continue to drive customer loyalty, including participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. We believe that satisfied customers will generate additional business at our properties, yielding strong overall hotel performance for us and our hotel owners. Strong results at our existing properties will encourage further development of additional hotels under our brands and conversions of existing hotels to our brands with both (i) owners who currently have properties in our system and (ii) new owners who sign management or franchise contracts with us in the future, which further supports our growth and future financial performance. We believe that our existing hotel system and development pipeline, which will require minimal capital investment from us, positions us to further improve our business, allocate capital effectively and meet our customers' demands and preferences in the future.

Our Guest Loyalty Program 
 
 Hilton Honors is our award-winning guest loyalty program that supports our portfolio of brands. The program generates significant repeat business by rewarding guests with points for each stay at our properties, which are then redeemable for free or discounted room nights at our properties and other goods and services. Hilton Honors members can also use points earned to transact with many strategic partners, including credit card providers, such as American Express, airlines, rail and car rental companies, Amazon, Lyft and others. Hilton Honors members who book through preferred Hilton channels also have access to instant benefits, including a flexible payment slider that allows members to choose nearly any combination of points and money to book a stay, an exclusive member discount and free standard Wi-Fi. Members also have access to contactless technology exclusively through the Hilton Honors app, where members can check in, choose their room and access their room using Digital Key. The program provides targeted marketing, promotions and customized guest experiences to 152 million members. Affiliation with our loyalty program encourages members to allocate more of their travel spend to our hotels. The percentage of travel spend we capture from loyalty members increases as they move up the tiers of our program. The program is funded by contributions from eligible revenues generated by Hilton Honors members and collected from properties in our system, as well as our strategic partnerships. The funds collected by the Hilton Honors program are subsequently applied to reimburse hotels and strategic partners for Hilton Honors points redemptions by loyalty members and to pay for administrative expenses and marketing initiatives that support the program.

 Management and Franchise 
 
 We manage hotels and license our brands through our management and franchise segment, which included 778 managed hotels and 6,255 franchised hotels consisting of 1,096,115 total rooms, as of December 31, 2022. This segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners under management and franchise contracts, as well as from fees associated with license agreements. We grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their properties. Our management and franchise contracts provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned and paid.

Hotel Management 
 
 Our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property. Often, particularly in the U.S., we employ the individuals working at these locations. Terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base management fee, which is generally based on a percentage of the hotel s monthly gross revenue, and, when applicable, an incentive management fee, which is generally based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits, normally over a one-year calendar period, and, in some cases, may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner. In general, the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our out-of-pocket expenses. In turn, our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas, including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and the appointment of certain key personnel. Additionally, the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, as reimbursement for the costs related to our: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance programs. Owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As of December 31, 2022, we m anaged 778 hotels with 244,037 r ooms, which does not include hotels in our ownership segment. 
 
 The initial terms of our management contracts are typically 20 to 30 years. In certain cases, we are both the franchisor and manager of the hotel, when we enter into a franchise contract in addition to the management contract, and, in these cases, we classify the hotel as managed in our system. Extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary, but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels. Generally, these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for either five or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the hotel owner's option or by mutual agreement, as specified by the contract. 
 
 Some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events, including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria. Performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel s performance individually and/or in comparison to specified competitive hotels. We often have an optional cure right to pay an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period, although in some cases our cure rights are limited. 
 
 Franchising 
 
 We license our IP, including our brand names, trademarks and service marks, and our operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts. We do not own, manage or operate franchised properties, do not employ the individuals working at these properties and do not have any legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating these properties. We conduct periodic inspections of our franchised hotels to ensure that brand standards that we establish are maintained. For newly franchised hotels, including both new construction and conversions of existing hotels outside of our system, we approve the location, as well as the plans for the facilities, to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards. For existing franchised hotels, we provide franchisees with property improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards, so that they can remain in our hotel system. We also earn license fees from license agreements with strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and HGV for the use of our IP. 
 
 Each franchisee pays us an application, initiation or other fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract. Franchisees also pay a royalty fee, generally based on a percentage of the hotel s monthly gross room revenue and, in some cases, may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable. Additionally, the franchisees generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, as reimbursement for the costs related to our: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance programs. Franchisees are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As of December 31, 2022, we franchised 6,335 hotels and resorts, including timeshare properties, with 865,781 rooms. 
 
 Our franchise contracts typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new hotels and approximately 10 to 20 years for hotels converting from hotels outside of our system. At the expiration of the initial term, we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee for an additional term generally ranging from 10 to 15 years. We have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default, including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards. If a franchise contract is terminated by us because of a franchisee s default, the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages.

Ownership 
 
 As a hotel owner and lessee, we focus on maximizing cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by, among other things, maximizing hotel revenues, implementing cost-effective labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs. Through our disciplined approach to hotel and asset management, we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their competitive position and, at many of our hotels, we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability. As of December 31, 2022, the segment included 52 hotels totaling 17,612 rooms, comprising 45 hotels that we leased, two hotels that were each leased by a consolidated variable interest entity ("VIE") and five hotels owned or leased by unconsolidated affiliates. 
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 
 Hilton strives to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders through: (i) our resilient business model; (ii) our ESG efforts to support the long-term viability of our business; and (iii) our more than 100-year history of filling the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality and making the world a better place through travel and connection. 
 
 As one of the world s largest hospitality companies, we recognize Hilton has a responsibility to protect the planet and support the communities we serve to ensure our hotel destinations remain vibrant and resilient for generations of travelers to come. Hilton is committed to driving responsible travel and tourism globally and furthering positive environmental and social impact across our operations and communities through our ESG strategy, Travel with Purpose. We believe that the need for responsible leadership commensurate with our global scale will continue to be of great importance in the years to come. In 2022, Hilton was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices ("DJSI") for the sixth consecutive year, scoring in the 100th percentile in our industry, reflecting Hilton's significant investment in building a leading ESG strategy. 
 
 We continue to make progress in our ESG commitments and, in 2022, refreshed our ESG strategic framework to focus and communicate our ESG strategy across all three ESG pillars: (i) environmental aiming toward a net zero future with well-defined targets for watts (carbon and energy), water and waste; (ii) social supporting and advancing careers, communities and responsible conduct; and (iii) governance advancing and measuring our goals with a focus on integrity and transparency and leveraging our public affairs and advocacy work, our partnerships and our policies and reporting. 
 
 As part of the 2022 update to our ESG strategic framework, we launched new environmental and social impact goals, including updated emissions reduction targets. Our updated 2030 Goals align with the global Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs") adopted by the United Nations in 2015 and are guided by our evaluation of the social and environmental issues that are critical to our business and our long-term success. Further, our ESG efforts are supported by a robust governance structure, designed to ensure our ESG objectives are an important part of our business and strategic priorities as we work towards our 2030 Goals. Our Chief ESG Officer reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, and our executive committee receives at least quarterly updates on our ESG programs and progress towards our 2030 Goals. The Nominating ESG Committee, one of the three standing committees of Hilton's board of directors, receives quarterly reports on progress toward our 2030 Goals, reviews and assesses our ESG strategy and makes recommendations to the board and management as appropriate. The board of directors also receives annual updates on progress towards our 2030 Goals. 
 
 Significant ESG risks, including risks related to climate change, natural disasters, supply chain disruption, health and safety and ethics, fraud and corruption are integrated in Hilton's Enterprise Risk Management program as part of Hilton's annual Enterprise Risk assessment process. The results of this process are reviewed by our executive committee and our board of directors, including the Audit Committee, to inform enterprise-wide strategic planning. We also engage with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to refine and enhance our strategy, to help align our programs with the issues that matter the most to our business and stakeholders. 
 
 As part of this effort, we completed a thorough ESG materiality assessment in 2020, leveraging guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI"), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") and the World Economic Forum. Of the more than 200 ESG issues considered, our stakeholders were most focused on the following: climate action; employee development and well-being; diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE I"); employee and guest health, safety and security; human rights; and ethical business practices and regulatory compliance. We used the results of this materiality assessment to advance our Travel with Purpose strategy in alignment with organizational priorities, inform management of ESG risks and drive long-term value for our business and our stakeholders. 
 
 We remain committed to reducing our carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science. We evaluate our climate change risks and report annually on our ESG performance, with our reporting prepared in accordance with the GRI 
 12 

standards, while integrating the recommendations of the SASB and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD"). 
 
 LightStay, our proprietary and award-winning ESG management system, is aligned with the criteria of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council ("GSTC") and is used to measure, manage and report many of Hilton's key environmental and social performance metrics, including, but not limited to, carbon emissions, energy, water, waste, volunteer hours, in-kind donations and efficiency projects. Our hotels use LightStay to track and report environmental and social impact data, assess performance and recognize performance improvement opportunities and achievements. 
 
 We recognize that achieving meaningful progress towards our 2030 Goals and the SDGs requires collaboration across a wide range of partners and external stakeholders, including the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance ("SHA"), an organization that represents the hotel industry s collective efforts to support and protect destinations and communities for future generations. Hilton leaders continue to engage with SHA and its membership and have participated in recent efforts to advance the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative and the Hotel Water Measurement Initiative methodologies, which are designed to enable the industry to more consistently measure and report on carbon emissions and water consumption in hotels. 
 
 The Hilton Global Foundation (formerly known as the Hilton Effect Foundation), which was launched in 2019, supports nonprofits and local community organizations that serve as partners to amplify our environmental and social impact around the world. The Hilton Global Foundation is our primary international philanthropic arm and is registered as a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) charitable organization. In 2022, we launched the Hilton UK Foundation to support Hilton's mission to support a sustainable future in the UK. Hilton has a long history of partnering with organizations in the UK whose environmental and social priorities align with Hilton's, and we expect to continue these partnerships through the work of the Hilton UK Foundation. The Hilton Global Foundation and Hilton UK Foundation are collectively referred to as the Foundation. 
 
 In 2022, the Foundation awarded more than 2 million in grants to organizations supporting destination stewardship, climate action, career development and community resilience. Since 2019, the Foundation has awarded more than 8 million in grants to more than 130 nongovernmental and community-based organizations. 
 
 Environmental Impact 
 
 In 2022, we reevaluated our environmental impact 2030 Goals and set more ambitious targets. Hilton was the first major hospitality company to set science-based targets that were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative ("SBTi") and the first major hotel brand to obtain revalidation by SBTi. In June 2022, SBTi verified our near-term targets (1.5 C by 2030), which are in alignment with our updated environmental 2030 Goals to cut emissions intensity of our managed hotel portfolio by 75 percent and of our franchised hotel portfolio by 56 percent, with 2008 as our baseline. We continue to work toward our 2030 Goal of reducing water and waste intensity at the hotels we operate, including those that are owned, leased and managed, by 50 percent, with 2008 as our baseline. To achieve our reduction targets, we partnered with a global leader in the field of sustainability and energy procurement to help map out a phased implementation strategy to help us make informed decisions and chart a path to achieving our energy reduction goals. Although we believe that our environmental impact 2030 Goals are ambitious yet attainable, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet them. As climate science continues to evolve we may further refine our environmental impact 2030 Goals. 
 
 In 2022, we continued the certification of our portfolio of hotels to ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environmental) and ISO 50001 (Energy) standards, which marks 11 years of our properties certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 and eight years for ISO 50001. Further, in alignment with our science-based targets, we continue to take steps to increase our sourcing of renewable energy at our hotels around the world. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region, one third of the hotels we operated, as well as our Watford and Glasgow corporate offices, were supplied with 100 percent renewable energy during 2022. In the U.S., we continue to have a renewable energy option for our managed hotels. Additionally, we provide our customers with the opportunity to make their meetings and events sustainable through our Meet with Purpose offering, a program launched to help customers gather responsibly, incorporate food donations into their programs and positively impact their destinations, or offset their meeting through our carbon neutral meeting offering at select participating hotels. 
 
 We continued our focus on our food waste reduction and food donation initiatives, with many of our managed hotels in the U.S. and EMEA piloting donation programs and analytical software to help reduce food waste and associated costs. We also operate a soap recycling program, with over 5,500 of our hotels partnered with soap recycling organizations to donate soap bars and other unused supplies from our hotels to those in need, consistent with our effort to reduce waste. We have made progress on our commitment to reduce single use plastics at our hotels, offering Digital Keys at more than 80 percent of our hotels and requiring all hotels to comply with the adoption of bulk amenities by 2023. 
 13 

In 2022, the Foundation partnered with organizations, such as the Global Water Challenge, One Tree Planted and the Ocean Conservancy, that are making a positive impact in our communities and on the environment. Specifically, the Foundation works with partners that advance: (i) climate action with initiatives that combat urgent climate change and its impact, reducing carbon footprint, energy, water and waste; and (ii) destination stewardship with initiatives that improve travel destinations and positively impact the environment, including conducting clean up, conservation and preservation activities. 
 
 We primarily generate carbon emissions from the operation of our hotels. During 2022, our hotels continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and occupancy at our owned, leased and managed properties exceeded 2021 levels, and, by the second half of 2022, it approached 2019 levels. As such, we experienced a year-over-year increase in consumption of energy, water and waste in 2022 in-line with the year-over-year increase in occupancy. However, this consumption, on both a per square meter and absolute basis, remained below 2019 levels, and we remain on track to achieve our updated 2030 Goals. 
 
 We have achieved the following reductions in environmental impact since 2008: 
 
 Percent Reduction Achieved Since 2008 (1) 
 Reduction in water consumption per square meter (2) 
 33 Reduction in landfilled waste per square meter (2)

 (2) Reflects performance across Hilton's owned, leased and managed properties, which totaled approximately 28.4 million square meters as of December 31, 2022. Although consumption and waste generation were higher in 2022 than in 2021 and 2020, correlated with the increase in occupancy resulting from our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, they remain below 2019 levels. 
 
 The data in the following tables, which have been reviewed by an independent third party, reflect the key sustainability metrics for our managed, owned and leased properties, as well as recommendations of the SASB within their Hotel Lodging and Restaurant Standards:

 (1) The decreases in consumption reflected in these measures during the year ended December 31, 2020 and then the increases in consumption reflected in these measures, if applicable, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 were primarily attributable to the reduction in occupancy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, followed by Hilton's recovery from the impact of the pandemic during 2021 and 2022 and the related increases in occupancy. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the hotel operations at approximately 380 of our managed, owned and leased hotels were completely or partially suspended for some period of time, while only approximately 120 had suspended operations for some period of time during 2021. Substantially all of our hotels had re-opened by the end of 2021 and have remained open and operating since then. The changes in occupancy and the number of hotel suspensions were directly correlated with and impacted the consumption of energy, water and waste at our hotels around the world. 
 (2) Scope 2 market-based emissions as defined by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). 
 (3) Water stress as defined by the World Resources Institute ("WRI"). Represents the percentage (by square meter) of owned, leased and managed hotels, in regions with baseline water stress, that have high or extremely high baseline water stress. 
 (4) Amount of waste not diverted from landfills in metric tons per square meter was 0.0033, 0.0029, 0.0026 and 0.0052 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Although the amount was higher in 2022 than in 2021 and 2020, correlated with the increase in the amount of waste generated resulting from our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it remained below 2019 levels. 
 (5) Total floor area of Hilton's owned, leased and managed properties, for which absolute consumption is reflected, was 28.4 million square meters, 27.5 million square meters, 24.9 million square meters and 23.9 million square meters as of December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Absolute consumption increased during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to our increased floor area and increased occupancy, as described above. 
 
 Social Impact 
 
 With a presence in 123 countries and territories, we use our global scale to focus on creating learning and career growth opportunities, positively impacting our communities and promoting responsible, inclusive conduct across our value chain, all with consideration for human rights and DE I. 
 
 As such, in 2022, we updated our social impact 2030 Goals to the following: (i) to provide 5 million learning and career growth opportunities for our employees and our communities with a focus on underrepresented groups; (ii) to meaningfully impact 20 million community members; and (iii) to promote responsible, inclusive conduct across 100 percent of our value chain operations. We used these goals to guide our social impact initiatives in 2022. 
 
 Through our Foundation, we partner with the International Youth Foundation by providing our Passport to Success Concierge program, an online course that is free to youth around the globe who are interested in building the core skills for a career in travel and tourism. Since its launch in August 2021, over 22,000 youth and Hilton employees have accessed the program through 2022. We partner with organizations around the globe supporting career development including Jobs for America's Graduates, Travis Early College High School Hospitality College, The Punlaan School and R.O.L.E. Foundation. 
 
 Hilton also remains committed to combating human trafficking, and we require all hotel-based employees to complete an annual training on identifying signs of trafficking. We partner with expert organizations, including Vital Voices, It s a Penalty and ECPAT, to help prevent and mitigate such risks, including at an industry level through the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance, World Travel and Tourism Council, American Hotel Lodging Association and United Kingdom ("U.K.") Stop Slavery Hotel Industry Network. The Foundation furthered these efforts by committing to grant 500,000 in total over the next three years to the AHLA Foundation's No Room for Trafficking ("NRFT") Survivor Fund, starting in 2023. The NRFT Survivor Fund aims to equip community-based organizations with the resources to engage and support trafficking survivors from direct financial support of their short-term, baseline needs to career-related support. 
 
 Further, we have reached more than 35,000 refugees since 2015 through volunteering, in-kind donations, purchasing, training, shelter and employment. In addition, in 2022, in partnership with #HospitalityHelps and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (a UN Refugee Agency), we supported the Ukraine refugee crisis by providing accommodations to more than 42,000 refugees seeking shelter across our EMEA region. Further, Hilton is part of the Tent Coalition for Refugees ("Tent") in the U.S. and Canada, and in 2022, we expanded our hiring commitment in partnership with Tent to hire 1,500 refugees in the U.S. over the next three years. 
 
 During 2022, Hilton and the Foundation supported our hotel teams and surrounding communities through disasters and crises, including Hurricane Ian and the Ukraine refugee crisis. This approach included donating to organizations at the 
 15 

frontlines of the crises, supporting the delivery of meals, medical care and other basic needs, as well as support for the families of impacted employees through Hilton's third-party operated Team Member Assistance Fund ("TMAF"). In August 2022, Hilton expanded its TMAF program to provide further assistance to its employees. In addition to continuing to support Team Members following disasters, the expanded program enables the TMAF to support employees experiencing undue financial hardship due to unexpected personal circumstances and larger crisis situations. Hilton employees, as well as individuals working at managed and franchised hotels who are not employed by Hilton, can apply for financial assistance when impacted by disaster and extreme hardship. In 2022, the TMAF provided assistance grants to more than 1,400 individuals. 
 
 In addition to collaboration across our industry and within the business community, we are focused on achieving change by leveraging the scale of our supply chain. We remain committed to embedding robust due diligence across our supply chain and partnering with suppliers to advance positive impact in our communities. Furthermore, by leveraging our size and scale, we also aim to expand local sourcing from small businesses and strengthen business with diverse suppliers. Through our award-winning Supplier Diversity Program, we engage women-, minority-, veteran-, disabled- and LGTBQ+ owned businesses in sourcing opportunities across Hilton in all categories. 
 
 During 2022, our employees around the world reported nearly 345,000 volunteer hours in their local communities, including during our Travel with Purpose Week, an annual week of volunteering focused on destination stewardship, including beach cleanups, tree planting, trash pickup and clothing donations. 
 
 Human Capital Management 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed or managed approximately 159,000 individuals working at our owned, leased and managed properties and corporate offices. There were an additional 259,000 individuals employed by third-party owners working at our franchised properties. 
 
 We strive to be the most hospitable company in the world, and we believe that an effective human capital management strategy is an essential component of that effort. Our strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry, and our executive committee reviews talent strategy and succession plans on a quarterly basis to assess current and future talent needs. We want to build a strong employee-centered culture that creates connectivity, camaraderie and trust among all employees, which then supports our employees to deliver positive experiences to guests at our hotels. 
 
 Attracting and retaining talent remains a leading area of focus, as competition for talent across industries remains strong. While our hiring levels in 2022 were higher than they were before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been affected by global labor shortages, making it more difficult to recruit talent. In response, we continue to review our compensation policies to maintain competitiveness and we have invested in employee programs and offerings and enhanced our recruiting strategies to tap into new pools of talent. 
 
 DE I 
 
 Our workforce should represent the communities where we live and work, which is why we are committed to achieving global gender parity and 25 percent U.S. ethnic representation at our corporate leadership levels by the end of 2027. Our leaders are committed to our diversity and inclusion efforts, and we hold them accountable through our organizational objectives that measure their performance against our commitments. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the global workforce that we employ or manage was 43 percent women. Globally, corporate leadership was 40 percent women and hotel leadership was 25 percent women. As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S., our workforce was 72 percent ethnically diverse, with U.S. corporate leadership being 19 percent ethnically diverse and U.S. hotel leadership being 23 percent ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2022, our board of directors, excluding management directors, was 50 percent women and 25 percent ethnically diverse. 
 
 Hilton has a long legacy of supporting the military dating back to our founder, Conrad Hilton, a World War I veteran. Since the launch of our Operation Opportunity program in 2015, we have hired more than 35,000 veterans, spouses, caregivers and dependents. Veterans and their spouses are valuable assets for our company as they bring a unique set of highly transferable skills, experience and values. 
 
 16 

As part of our commitment to an inclusive environment, we offer the following resources to our employees: 
 
 Team Member Resource Groups ("TMRG") Our nine TMRGs have global reach and each one is sponsored by an executive leader. They provide members with opportunities for career development and the chance to share their unique perspectives and viewpoints with leadership and other colleagues to drive important conversations about inclusion and equity across the enterprise. 
 
 Courageous Conversations Courageous Conversations is a global, virtual learning series featuring internal and external thought leaders who explore elements of DE I to help drive greater awareness, understanding and a more inclusive workplace. 
 
 Pathway Programs Hilton helps foster economic mobility for historically underrepresented talent and supports diversity efforts across our organization. We have partnerships with racial and social justice organizations, university scholarship programs and a Pathways Program Office, which is focused on expanding our current pathways programs and stewarding the creation of new pathways for future employees to join Hilton. 
 
 Annual trainings We require all employees to complete training as part of our Inclusive and Respectful Workplace curriculum, which is based on the underlying principles of our Code of Conduct. This annual requirement includes training on unconscious bias, DE I, preventing human trafficking and anti-harassment. Our Code of Conduct states that we do not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment on the basis of any characteristic protected by applicable law. For our guest-facing employees, our mandatory DE I training is scenario-driven training designed to promote positive, inclusive behaviors. 
 
 Thrive at Hilton 
 
 Thrive at Hilton is our value proposition designed to enable employees to grow and flourish in both their professional and personal lives. To make that happen, we offer programs designed to provide our employees with tools to excel in their roles. 
 
 We offer a range of benefits and programs to help our employees thrive at work and at home. Such benefits and programs include paid time off, parental leave, adoption assistance, subsidized health insurance, education assistance and flexible work arrangements, including remote work opportunities for our corporate employees, and Go Hilton Travel programs, which make discounted rooms available to hotel and corporate employees, as well as their families and friends. 
 
 We strive to provide medical and mental health care that is convenient, accessible and affordable for our employees. Our programs include: 
 
 Care for All a global platform launched in 2022 focused on caregiving that provides resources for employee self-care, as well as enabling employees to care for others, including sick, disabled or elderly family members, children and pets. This benefit is also extended to employees' families and friends. 
 
 Wellthy a caregiving concierge service which provides assistance to employees working through the logistical and administrative tasks related to care, such as finding the right in-home aide, contesting medical bills, evaluating care providers or finding care options for veterans for eligible employees in the U.S., U.K. and Ireland. 
 
 Employee Assistance Program offers free and confidential services, such as counseling and recommending resources to find services such as child and eldercare, legal advice and apartment hunting and relocation. 
 
 We regularly survey our employees to gauge the level of job satisfaction and effective relationships with management, among other things and use their feedback to inspire program enhancements and new offerings. We strive to maximize employee retention and minimize attrition with these and other measures. Approximately 35 percent of our U.S. employees have been with Hilton for at least 10 years. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 Hilton offers competitive pay and benefits to its employees, including a variety of compensation programs and comprehensive benefit programs. Hilton has hired consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of executive compensation and benefit programs and utilized their feedback to further our commitment to deliver competitive levels of 
 17 

compensation and benefits. We regularly review gender and diversity pay parity among our employees as part of our ongoing talent processes. 
 
 We also want our employees to share in our success and, as a result of employee feedback, we offer an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") for eligible employees in the U.S., U.K. and United Arab Emirates. Through our ESPP, eligible employees can purchase Hilton stock through after-tax payroll deductions at a 15 percent discount from the market stock price and benefit from the hard work they put into making Hilton a success. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30 percent of people employed or managed by us globally and approximately 40 percent of people working in the U.S. were covered by various collective bargaining agreements that generally address pay rates, working hours, other terms and conditions of employment, certain employee benefits and orderly settlement of labor disputes. 
 
 Development and Training 
 
 Our career development approach emphasizes customized experiences so that employees can follow a training and career path best suited to their goals. Hilton University, our global learning platform, gives employees access to a robust library of learning resources. We partner with leading educational institutions and content providers across the globe to deliver high-quality, relevant content to our employees, including a wide array of general business, industry or function-specific technical skills and leadership development courses and programs. Our Hilton University platform, Job Skills Hubs and LinkedIn Learnings Playlists provide flexible, accessible learning designed to help our employees learn and grow. 
 
 Our employees have the opportunity to grow their leadership skills and careers through our Lead@Hilton framework, which is designed to develop leaders throughout their careers and features the Hilton Leaders Teaching Leaders video series, as well as content from partners such as Cornell University and Harvard University. Curriculums curated for varying levels of experience aim to provide foundational tools, as well as coaching, mentoring and wellness resources. 
 
 Our GM Academy curriculum is centered on nine core General Manager ("GM") business capabilities, some of which include leadership and people management, asset management, customer engagement and commercial performance. Additionally, Hilton's Signature Leadership Development programs focus on building effective leaders across the enterprise to grow our leadership bench strength. These programs provide opportunities for participants to develop key capabilities, network with and learn from senior leaders and enhance leadership and business acumen. 
 
 In 2022, we launched our partnership with Guild Education to provide our U.S. employees with a continuing education platform to help them pursue and attain their educational goals debt-free. Through this partnership, employees have access to a wide variety of educational credentials from leading universities and learning providers including high school completion, English language learning, college degrees and professional certifications. 
 
 Awards and Recognition 
 
 We have consistently been recognized for our Hilton culture, and our awards for 2022 included: Following our placement as #1 in 2021, an induction into DiversityInc's Hall of Fame for the Top Companies for Diversity, Military Times Best for Vets #14 (Overall) and #1 (Hospitality), Military Friendly Employer with Gold distinction, Veteran Magazine Best of the Best Veteran Friendly Company, Great Place to Work Institute ("GPTW") #2 World s Best Workplace, GPTW Fortune #2 Best Place to Work in the U.S., GPTW Fortune #1 Best Place to Work for Women in the U.S. (for the fourth consecutive year) and GPTW Fortune #1 Best Place to Work in six countries (Austria, China, Ireland, Peru, Turkiye and Uruguay). Additionally, we received a 100 percent rating in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign for our commitment to corporate policies, practices and benefits pertinent to LGBTQ+ employees for the ninth consecutive year. 
 
 Governance, Ethics and Regulatory Compliance 
 
 As a core underpinning of our entire organization, our ethics and compliance program is overseen by our board of directors, which expects all Hilton employees to conduct themselves at high standards with respect to all ethics and compliance matters. Our Code of Conduct establishes a set of global business principles, with our compliance organization, training, risk management and monitoring activities tailored to address unique risks by geography, business line, function and level. Our Code of Conduct is supported by a robust set of compliance policies addressing risk areas such as corruption, trade sanctions, insider trading, privacy, confidential information, antitrust and escalation of concerns. Our legal and compliance training program, which is an annual requirement for all of our employees, provides the ability to convey a consistent set of compliance 
 18 

standards across the organization in formats designed to target different knowledge levels, learning styles and functional needs. Our annual training calendar includes mandatory training and supplemental training that is supported by company-wide awareness campaigns highlighting Hilton-specific risks and scenarios. We also use passive communication channels, including electronic bulletin board screens in the employee break room areas of our hotels, and internal newsletters, including a publication that highlights real Hilton Hotline matters and their resolutions. 
 
 In governing the physical safety of our properties and teams, to help ensure the safety and security of our employees and guests, we constantly monitor threats and incidents around the world through online tools and external networks and partnerships; support our properties globally with crisis alert communications, crisis plans and area crisis teams; provide employees with safety and security training resources; and conduct safety and security audits annually using a risk-based approach. 
 
 Our legal compliance team administers a third-party risk management program so that we understand the qualifications, reputation and associations of third parties with whom we transact, particularly third parties who interface with government officials and third parties who act in Hilton s name, such as owners of our hotels. The third-party risk management program includes due diligence, education materials for third parties, ongoing monitoring of relationships and appropriate contract audit and termination rights. Our legal compliance team also monitors EthicsPoint, a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool to assist management and employees address fraud, abuse and other misconduct in the workplace. The Audit Committee of our board of directors receives regular updates from our legal compliance team. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager, franchisor, owner and lessee. Competition in the hospitality industry is based on several criteria, generally including: the attractiveness of the facility; location; level of service; quality of accommodations; amenities; food and beverage options and outlets; public and meeting spaces and other guest services; consistency of service; room rate; brand reputation; and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Our properties and brands compete with other hotels, resorts, motels, inns and other accommodation rental services in their respective geographic markets or customer segments, including facilities owned by local interests, individuals, national and international chains, institutions, investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). We believe that our position as a multi-branded manager, franchisor, owner and lessee of hotels with an associated global, system-wide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us continue to maintain our position as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world. 
 
 Our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies. While local and independent brand competitors vary, on a global scale, our primary competitors are Accor S.A., Choice Hotels International, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Marriott International, Radisson Hotel Group and Wyndham Hotels Resorts. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. While results were less predictable as a result of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions, based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters. 
 
 Cyclicality 
 
 The hospitality industry is cyclical, and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms, occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel, including personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, tend to be more fixed than variable. As a result of such fixed costs, in a negative economic environment, the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. In 2020, we and our hotel owners experienced a downturn in the current industry cycle driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued into the beginning of 2021. However, the level of travel in 2021 and 2022 recovered substantially when compared to that of 2020, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, such performance exceeded performance for the same periods in 2019. 
 19 

Intellectual Property 
 
 In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents are very important to the success of our business. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance, registration and protection of our IP, which we believe has become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 
 Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises, many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction. 
 
 In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. Operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations. 
 
 We also manage hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of casinos at certain properties in Puerto Rico and Egypt, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in Puerto Rico and Egypt and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions. 
 
 For additional information on government regulation, including environmental regulations and requirements, refer to "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
 
 Insurance 
 
 U.S. hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners. If not participating in our programs, hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. Generally, U.S. franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs, but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. Foreign managed and franchised hotels are generally required to participate in certain of our insurance programs. In addition, our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design, development and operation of such hotel. 
 
 Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks, and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume. Our third-party insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insurance retentions or deductible obligations. We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels, and we maintain workers' compensation or equivalent coverage for all of our employees. We also are self-insured for health coverages for some of our U.S. and Puerto Rico employees, which include those working at our corporate operations and managed hotels, with purchased insurance protection for costs over specified thresholds. In general, our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels. 
 
 Where You Can Find More Information 
 
 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings are also available free of charge on our website at ir.hilton.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 20 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 
 We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth. 
 
 Our business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including: 
 
 significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world; 
 
 the financial condition of third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners; 
 
 relationships with third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners, including the risk that owners may terminate our management, franchise or joint venture contracts; 
 
 decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks; 
 
 decreases in the availability and/or increases in the cost of capital necessary for us and third-party hotel owners to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations; 
 
 changes in operating costs, including employee compensation and benefits, energy, insurance, food and beverage and other supplies; 
 
 increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by increases in revenues in our business, as well as increases in overall prices and the prices of our offerings due to inflation, which could weaken consumer demand for travel and the other products we offer and adversely affect our revenues; 
 
 changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs; 
 
 the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations; 
 
 the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs; 
 
 significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage; 
 
 shortages of labor or labor disruptions; 
 
 the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries who sell our hotel rooms to guests to attract and retain customers; 
 
 the quality of services provided by franchisees, including ability to comply with relevant regulations and contractual requirements relating to a variety of issues including environment, human rights and labor; 
 
 delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects; 
 
 cyclical over-building in the hospitality industry; 
 
 changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business, geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development; 
 
 21 

changes in the supply and demand for hotel services, including rooms, food and beverage and other products and services; and 
 
 the costs required for climate change initiatives, including those resulting from regulatory changes or stakeholder or customer expectations. 
 
 Any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge third-party hotel owners for providing management and franchise services or hotel customers for hospitality products and services, or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties. As a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth. 
 
 Macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services. 
 
 Macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services, including demand for rooms at our hotels. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 
 changes in general economic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, low consumer confidence, increases in unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy and financial markets; 
 
 conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel or result in temporary closures or other disruption at our hotel properties, including travel-related accidents, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, Ebola, Zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 (swine flu) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS); 
 
 geo-political activity, political and social unrest and governmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S. and global political and social trends and policies, including potential barriers to travel, trade and immigration; 
 
 wars, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, political instability or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and resulting heightened travel security measures, any of which may foreclose travel to certain locales or decrease the appeal of travel among the general population; 
 
 the impact of U.S. Federal government shutdowns and other similar governmental budgetary impasses or reductions; 
 
 decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending, as well as cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business, such as industry conventions; 
 
 statements, actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities; 
 
 the financial and general business condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its effect on travel, including decreased airline capacity and routes and increased travel costs; 
 
 perceived negative impacts of tourism on local cultures, human rights and the environment; 
 
 cyber-attacks; 
 
 the impact of climate change or availability of natural resources; 
 
 natural, climate-related or man-made disasters and extreme weather conditions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, oil spills and nuclear incidents; 
 
 labor shortages, which could restrict our ability to efficiently operate or grow our business and/or increase our costs; 
 
 organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics; and 
 
 22 

other changes in the overall demand for what we offer, including the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers. 
 
 Any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability, as well as limit or slow our future growth. 
 
 Consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. Declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties. In addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. During a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases, our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and COVID-19 or other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments may negatively affect future results. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and advisories, stay-at-home directives, limitations on public gatherings and modified work arrangements, all of which resulted in cancellations and reduced travel around the world, as well as complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations. Although distribution of approved vaccines for COVID-19 continued throughout 2022, access to and acceptance of vaccines has varied across regions and within individual countries. In addition, new strains of the virus have had increased transmissibility, complicating treatment and vaccination programs. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on certain of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to prior years, and COVID-19 or outbreaks of other contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments may continue to negatively affect future results. In particular, the continued impact of COVID-19 and the related restrictions in China have limited demand in that market. The long-term effects of the pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remain uncertain and will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of potential future serious illnesses, if any, the availability and public acceptance of vaccinations and other treatments to combat COVID-19 and the length of time it takes for demand to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to fully resume. The current and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging, food and beverage and other services, may negatively affect our results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows and liquidity. 
 
 The steps we took in 2020 to reduce operating costs for us and our owners, including temporarily reducing compensation, reducing our workforce and furloughing a substantial number of our employees, negatively affected our ability to attract and retain employees. Some hotels have faced challenges restaffing to pre-pandemic levels, which in some cases negatively affected guest experience and loyalty and, in turn, certain hotel results. We could still experience long-term impacts on our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other viruses through, for example, enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our partners, including third-party owners of our properties, third-party service providers, travel agencies, suppliers and other vendors. In particular, third-party owners of our hotels experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in revenues during the pandemic, thereby making it more difficult for them to maintain their hotels and service their indebtedness. 

23 

Risks Related to Operating Our Business 
 
 Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. 
 
 The segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition. Our principal competitors are other operators of luxury, full-service and focused-service hotels, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators, home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues or profits may decline. 
 
 Competition for hotel guests 
 
 We face competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business at our hotels. We compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, rates for hotel rooms, food and beverage and other services, property size and availability of rooms and conference and meeting space, accommodations and technology, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. Our competitors may have greater commercial, financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively, or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer. 
 
 Competition for management and franchise contracts 
 
 We compete to enter into management and franchise contracts. Our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, brand name recognition and reputation, our access to and willingness to invest capital, availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas, the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the third-party hotel owner of retaining our management services and/or using our brands. If the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited, we may not be able to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts. 
 
 Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Our brands are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation. In addition, the success of our hotel owners businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands. If our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable, unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality, we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners. 
 
 Changes in ownership or management practices, perceptions of our ESG practices, perception of guest or employee health or safety, the occurrence of accidents or injuries, cyber-attacks, security breaches, natural disasters, crime, failure of suppliers, franchisees or business partners to comply with relevant regulations and contractual requirements relating to a variety of issues including environmental, human rights and labor, individual guest, owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation, create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business. Because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations, events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations. In addition, the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination. Many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content. A negative incident or the perception of occurrence of a negative incident at one hotel could have far-reaching effects, including lost sales, customer boycotts, loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties. Such incidents have in the past and could in the future subject us to legal actions, including litigation, governmental investigations or penalties, along with the resulting additional adverse publicity. A perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to risks related to doing business with third-party property owners that could adversely affect our reputation, operational results or prospects for growth. 
 
 Unless we maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts, we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. 
 
 Our business depends on our ability to: (i) establish and maintain long-term, positive relationships with third-party hotel owners; and (ii) enter into new, and renew, management and franchise contracts. Although our management and franchise contracts are typically long-term arrangements, hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances, including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria. Our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to, among other things, risks common to the overall hospitality industry, including factors outside of our control. In addition, negative management and franchise pricing trends in the industry more broadly could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners. If we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. 
 
 Our business is subject to real estate investment risks for third-party hotel owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth. 
 
 Growth of our business is affected, and may potentially be limited, by factors influencing real estate development generally, including site availability, financing availability and cost, planning, zoning and other local approvals. In addition, market factors such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply, geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts, costs and availability of construction labor and materials and anticipated room rate structure, if not managed effectively by our third-party hotel owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business. 

If our third-party hotel owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by properties, or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans, our revenues, profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed. 
 
 Many of our third-party hotel owners pledged their properties as collateral for loans entered into at the time of development, purchase or refinancing. If our third-party hotel owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, which could be more difficult in the current interest rate environment, their lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt and repossess the property and we could also be required to make cash payments for any debt that we guarantee. While we maintain certain contractual protections, repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property. In addition, the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and, in some cases, fund operations during down cycles. Our hotel owners inability to obtain adequate funding or to do so at interest rates that they are willing to accept could materially adversely affect the operation, maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels, result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio. 
 
 Hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on a timely basis or at all. Unfavorable economic conditions also could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential third-party owners of our hotels, who may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays or cost pressures in developing hotel projects. As a result, some properties in our development pipeline have entered our system later than we anticipated, and new hotels have entered our pipeline at a slower rate than in the past, thereby negatively affecting our overall growth. Likewise, if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels, the quality of our hotels may suffer, which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty, and our performance may suffer as a result. 
 
 If our third-party property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties, guest preference for Hilton brands, Hilton's reputation and performance results could suffer. 
 
 Substantially all of our management and franchise contracts, as well as our license agreement with HGV, require third-party property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands, which include requirements related to the physical condition, use of technology, safety standards and appearance of the properties, as well as the service levels provided 
 25 

by hotel employees. These standards may evolve with customer preference, or we may introduce new requirements over time. If our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards, or based on customer demand more broadly, guest preference for our brands could diminish. In addition, if third-party property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts. We may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any individually terminated hotels or broader third-party owner relationships. 
 
 Contractual and other disagreements with third-party property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses or termination of existing management or franchise contracts. 
 
 Our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. Any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. We cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party. Furthermore, specific to our industry, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination. Our fees from any property permitted to be terminated would be eliminated, and accordingly, may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 
 Some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels, which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2,821 hotels in our development pipeline, which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands. The commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline, in particular for hotels not currently under construction, is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, the owner's or developer's ability to obtain adequate financing and governmental or regulatory approvals. As a result, not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system. 
 
 New hotel brands or non-hotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Since 2011, we have launched ten new brands: Home2 Suites by Hilton; Curio Collection by Hilton; Canopy by Hilton; Tru by Hilton; Tapestry Collection by Hilton; Motto by Hilton; LXR Hotels Resorts; Signia by Hilton; Tempo by Hilton; and, most recently, Spark by Hilton. We may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and non-hotel brands in the future. In addition, the Hilton Garden Inn, DoubleTree by Hilton and Hampton by Hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the U.S. over the past several years. We may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets. New hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners, franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces. If new branded hotel products, non-hotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate, we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs, reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions. 
 
 Our investments in owned and leased real property (including through joint ventures) subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties, including: 
 
 governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws; 

fluctuations or loss in value of real estate or potential impairments in the value of our assets due to changes in market conditions and expectations of future hotels revenues and costs of operations in the area in which real estate or assets are located; 
 
 increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties; 
 
 26 

the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties, some of which were constructed many years ago, and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term; 
 
 construction delays, lack of availability of required construction materials or cost overruns (including labor and materials) related to necessary capital improvements of owned and leased properties; 
 
 periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements; 
 
 risks associated with any mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels, particularly in the current interest rate environment, and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing; 
 
 the inability to rebuild a property that has been damaged or destroyed by casualty, including a climate-related weather event, as a result of governmental regulations or other restrictions; 
 
 the inability to renew our leases on favorable terms or at all; 
 
 our limited ability to influence the decisions and operations of joint ventures in which we have a minority interest; 
 
 force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods, tsunamis, climate-related weather events, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or acts of terrorism; 
 
 contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property; 
 
 costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property; 
 
 increased operating costs including energy, insurance, food and beverage, supplies and other operating costs; and 
 
 the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets. 
 
 The negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned and leased properties because we, as the owner or lessee, bear the risk of the costs required to own and operate a hotel. Further, during times of economic distress, declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values, and we or our joint ventures may not be able to sell properties or exit leasing arrangements on favorable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 
 
 Failures in, material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites, including as a result of cyber-attacks on our systems or systems operated by third parties that provide operational and technical services to us, costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 
 We depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. We develop, own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management, procurement, finance, human resources, reservations, distribution and the operation of the Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. Such systems are subject to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, third-party criminal activity including "ransomware" or other malware and natural and man-made disasters. Although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location and cloud backup processes to back up our core reservation, property management, distribution and financial systems, certain of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility or with a single cloud-based provider. Although we continue to renovate and migrate portions of our operations to cloud-based providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloud-based providers, any loss or damage to our primary physical or cloud-based facilities could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site or cloud providers. Damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our 
 27 

ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. 
 
 We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide. In particular, our loyalty platform, property management, reservation and distribution systems rely on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties and cloud providers. The success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. If we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 We rely on certain vendors for traditional software and cloud/software-as-a-service operations to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems and applications so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. 
 
 We are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications, including changes in required technology interfaces, website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures, unexpected costs and changes and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications. Additional risks include computer malware, changes in applicable federal, state and international regulations, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations, e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 
 
 Cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business. 
 
 From time to time we and our third-party service providers experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. The techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and despite our deployment of cyber-attack prevention and detection techniques, we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. We have in the past been subject to cyber-attacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyber-attacks in the future and may experience data breaches. 
 
 Even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and, as a result of this loss in confidence, choose not to purchase from us. Such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation, fines, regulatory charges and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 We are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information. 
 
 We are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including costs related to compliance with U.S. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as risks associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union ("E.U."), the U.K., China and certain states within the U.S., have passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the handling of personal data. We collect internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes, including managing our workforce, providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes. We could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, reputational harm or other expenses, or other adverse effects on our business, due to failure to protect personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various U.S. and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards. 
 
 28 

In addition, U.S. states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. These laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business, and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies. If we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position. 
 
 The hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management, brand assurance and compliance, procurement, reservation systems, operation of our guest loyalty programs, distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities. These technologies may require refinements and upgrades, and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use. The development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. As various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner. In some cases, hotel owners may refuse to upgrade systems or deploy new technology to replace aging or end-of-life software and/or hardware. As a result, our business operations could be disrupted and our competitive position could decline, adversely affecting our financial performance, or we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system. 
 
 Because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services, third-party security incidents could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
 Third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services. These third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about us or our guests, employees or partners. Any third-party security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could negatively impact our operations. Unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. We rely on the internal processes and controls of third-party software and application vendors to maintain the security of all software code provided to or used by Hilton. Should those vendors fail to secure their products then we are at risk of unintentionally injecting malware into our systems via compromised software code they provide. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could negatively affect our reputation, our competitive position and our financial performance, and we could face lawsuits and potential liability. 
 
 Delays in service from third-party service providers could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance. 
 
 From time to time, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of various goods or services that we use in the operation of our business. The inability of such third parties to satisfy our or our guests' requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. If any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third-party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial performance could be negatively affected. 
 
 Failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws, including with regard to direct marketing, could result in fines or place restrictions on our business. 
 
 We rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. Any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, various U.S. state laws, such as the California Privacy Rights Act, international data protection laws, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and laws limiting the cross-border transfer of data that govern these activities or new laws that become effective in the future could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers. We also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies, and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies marketing materials. If access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired. 
 
 29 

The growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability. 
 
 A significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries, to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems. Search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business. If these bookings increase, these hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees. These hospitality intermediaries also may reduce bookings at our hotel properties by de-ranking our hotels in search results on their platforms, and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels. Although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration, replacement or renegotiation. Moreover, hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to the Hilton brands and systems. If this happens, our business and profitability may be significantly affected over time as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites, which increases costs to hotels in our system. Internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly in Europe. The outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels. 
 
 In addition, although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business. If that growth continues, it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business. Consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels' cost of sales. 
 
 Our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results. 
 
 We manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly, either online, by telephone to our call centers, through devices via our mobile application, or through intermediaries like travel agents, internet travel websites and other distribution channels. The cost, speed, efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands. Any disruption to the continuity of our reservation system, including any failure to maintain or upgrade such system, may adversely affect our ability to serve customers effectively and support reservations at our hotels. 
 
 The cessation, reduction or taxation of program benefits of our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program could adversely affect the Hilton brands and guest loyalty. 
 
 We manage the Hilton Honors guest loyalty program for all of the brands that we operate. Program members accumulate points primarily based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value. The program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts. System hotels, including, without limitation, third-party hotels under management and franchise contracts, contribute a percentage of the charges incurred by members of the loyalty program for each stay of a program member. In addition to the accumulation of points for future hotel stays at our brands, Hilton Honors arranges with third parties, such as airlines, other transportation services, online vendors, retailers and credit card companies, to sell Hilton Honors points for the use of their customers and/or to allow Hilton Honors members to use or exchange points for products or services made available to loyalty program members by those third parties. Currently, the program benefits are not taxed as income to members. If the program awards and benefits are materially altered, curtailed or taxed such that a material number of Hilton Honors members choose to no longer participate in the program, our business could be adversely affected. 
 
 30 

Because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the U.S., the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business. 
 
 We currently manage, franchise, own or lease hotels and resorts in 123 countries and territories around the world. Our rooms outside the U.S. represented approximately 31 percent , 30 percent and 28 percent of our system-wide rooms for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S., including: 
 
 rapid changes in governmental, economic or political policy, wars, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; 
 
 increases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of our licensed brands as an American brand; 
 
 recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets; 
 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate; 
 
 the effect of disruptions, including the temporary closure of hotel properties, caused by severe weather or climate-related events, natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), outbreak of disease, such as COVID-19, or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; 
 
 the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws; 

the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax-efficient manner; 
 
 the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws, sanctions, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws; 
 
 the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with developing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments with respect to human rights, including in the supply chain; 
 
 instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change; 
 
 political, economic and other uncertainty resulting from the U.K.'s exit from the E.U. (commonly known as "Brexit"), the terms of which could adversely affect our business; 
 
 uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and IP rights; 
 
 forced nationalization of our properties by local, state or national governments; and 
 
 the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries. 
 
 These factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from our hotels and resorts (as well as the market value of properties that we own or lease) located in international markets. While these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations. 
 
 Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability. 
 
 Our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). Although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and 
 31 

regulations, it is possible that hotels we manage, own or lease in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. Where we have identified potential violations in the past, we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to OFAC. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K. s Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations. 
 
 If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties, including the termination of management, franchising and ownership rights. In addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including our owners, joint venture partners, employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the FCPA, U.S. sanctions or other laws. These restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth. 
 
 In addition, we are subject to a number of modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labor reporting, training and mandatory due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the future. The impact of these laws, such as the U.K's Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, and similar legislation on hotel operations could increase costs of operations and reduce our profits. 
 
 Collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. 
 
 A significant number of our employees and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements, including approximately 30 percent of people employed or managed by us globally. If relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we manage, franchise, own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public demonstrations. A number of our collective bargaining agreements are in the process of being renegotiated, and, if more employees become unionized, we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future. Labor disputes, which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests. Further, adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. We do not have the ability to influence the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by third-party property owners. Increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. 
 
 Labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the labor market for employers. Labor shortages have affected the ability of our hotels to hire or re-hire employees during the ongoing recovery from the downturn caused by the pandemic. Among the factors that caused the labor shortages are the relative reduced appeal of working in the hospitality industry in a downturn, alternatives available in other industries and perceived health and safety concerns. As of December 31, 2022, we employed or managed approximately 159,000 individuals at our managed, owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world. If we are unable to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled individuals, our ability to staff and operate the hotels that we manage, own and lease could be diminished, which could reduce customer satisfaction, and our ability to manage our corporate business could be adversely affected. In addition, the inability of our franchisees to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands. Staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our owned, leased and managed hotels, as well as our franchised hotels, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of third-party owners. Additionally, an increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees, which could, in turn, lower demand from third-party owners to add hotels to our system. We also face challenges with respect to retaining corporate employees. If we lost the services of one or more senior 
 32 

executives, this could adversely affect strategic relationships, including relationships with third-party hotel owners, significant customers, joint venture partners and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies. 
 
 Any failure to protect our trademarks and other IP could reduce the value of the Hilton brands and harm our business. 
 
 The recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success. We have a significant number of trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services, plus at any given time, a number of pending applications for trademarks and other IP. However, those trademark or other IP registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use, control or protect our trademarks or other IP in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other IP without authorization. We may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions. For example, in certain jurisdictions, third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks, which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in those jurisdictions. Third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications. Defending against any such proceedings may be costly, and if unsuccessful, could result in the loss of important IP rights. Obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive, and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks. 
 
 Our IP is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use where local law, or lax enforcement of law, may not provide adequate protection. If our trademarks or other IP are improperly used, the value and reputation of the Hilton brands could be harmed. There are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our IP rights. Litigation of this type could be unsuccessful, costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation. In addition, we license certain of our trademarks to third parties. For example, we have granted HGV the right to use certain of our IP in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our IP in connection with their operation of the licensed hotel property. If HGV, a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could be harmed. Failure to maintain, control and protect our trademarks and other IP could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or third-party owners, and could adversely affect our results. 
 
 In addition, we license the right to use certain IP from unaffiliated third parties, including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees. If we are unable to use this IP, our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished. 
 
 Third-party claims that we infringe IP rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses. 
 
 Third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent, trademark, copyright or other IP rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets. We have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future. Any such claims, even those without merit, could: 
 
 be expensive and time consuming to defend, and result in significant damages; 
 
 force us to stop using the IP that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged IP; 
 
 force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services; 
 
 require us to enter into royalty, licensing, co-existence or other contracts to obtain the right to use a third party s IP; 
 
 limit our ability to develop new IP; and 
 
 limit the use or the scope of our IP or other rights. 
 
 In addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them. All necessary royalty, licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Any adverse results associated with third-party IP claims could negatively affect our business. 
 
 33 

Exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses that affect our business results. 
 
 Conducting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar ("USD") subjects us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results. We earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the U.S. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of USD required for foreign currency denominated expenses or significantly decrease the USD received from foreign currency denominated revenues. We also have exposure to currency translation risk because, generally, the results of our business outside of the U.S. are reported in local currencies and then translated to USD for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, changes between the foreign currency exchange rates and the USD will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the U.S. increases. 
 
 To mitigate foreign currency exposure, we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions. However, these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements, interest rate differentials and counterparty risk. 
 
 If the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage, franchise, own or lease, our profits could be reduced. 
 
 We operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climate-related disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our owners or the surrounding area. We carry, and/or we require our owners to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first-party and third-party losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary. Nevertheless, market forces beyond our control, such as the natural, climate-related and man-made disasters that occurred in recent years, could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners' ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. We anticipate increased costs of property, general liability and excess liability insurance across the portfolio in 2023 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in recent years. In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we and/or our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property. Additionally, certain types of losses may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive to insure. In addition, other types of losses or risks that we may face could fall outside of the general coverage terms and limits of our policies. 
 
 The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (the "Program") provides insurance capacity for terrorist acts and is currently authorized through December 31, 2027. If the Program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027, or if there are changes to the Program that would negatively affect insurance carriers, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and/or the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available, perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable. 

In some cases, these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured. As a result, we or owners of hotels that we manage or franchise could lose some or all of the capital we or they have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues, profits, management fees or franchise fees from the property. 
 
 Climate change could adversely affect our business. 
 
 As an operator and franchisor of hotel properties in 123 co untries, we are subject to the physical effects of climate change, including sea level rise, droughts and intensified storms and other weather events. Damage to our hotels resulting from the physical effects of climate change could lower demand for travel to certain locales and affect the performance of certain of our hotels, which could in turn have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 
 Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to ESG matters, that could expose us to numerous risks. 
 
 We are subject to the evolving rules and regulations with respect to ESG matters of a number of governmental and self-regulatory bodies and organizations, including the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, that could make compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, guests, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters and related disclosures. These changing 
 34 

rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention to comply with or meet those regulations and expectations. Developing and acting on ESG initiatives and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming. Further, ESG related information is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's proposed climate-related reporting requirements. Our ESG initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of our ESG disclosures. Further, statements about our ESG related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 
 Governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties. 
 
 In many jurisdictions, the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or U.S. federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or U.S. state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions status and citizenship requirements. These requirements are complex and subject to frequent revision, with changes at the U.S. federal level often accompanying new U.S. presidential administrations. We or our third-party owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or U.S. federal, state and local regulations in connection with the construction, continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties. The failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements, or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For instance, in 2010, we entered into a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice related to compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Although the bulk of our obligations under this settlement expired in 2015, certain managed and franchised hotels remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities. We have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts. If we fail to comply with any of the requirements of the ADA, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctive action, reputational harm, guest, advocacy group or employee lawsuits, and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations. 
 
 Changes in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to taxation at the federal, state or provincial and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In particular, our consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2018 are actively under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The IRS previously proposed material increases to our income tax liability related to our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program through the tax year ended December 31, 2013, which we resolved through a settlement. The taxation of the Hilton Honors program continues to be subject to audit. We may in the future be assessed tax on issues similar to those which were resolved through the 2013 tax year, and the amounts of any such future assessments may be material. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 35 

Foreign or U.S. environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities. 
 
 We are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal. Our failure to comply with such laws, including obtaining and maintaining any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. We could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated real property (including managed and franchised properties) or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. From time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. The presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. Such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. Environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those intended to lessen the impact of climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. 

Risks Related to Our Spin-offs 
 
 The spin-offs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders. 
 
 We received a private letter ruling from the IRS on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by us. Further, the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-offs under Section 355 of the Code and does not represent a determination by the IRS that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied. Moreover, if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spin-offs, the private letter ruling could be invalidated. The opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spin-offs regarding the qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under Section 355 of the Code similarly relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spun-off companies and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. Additionally, recently enacted legislation denies tax-free treatment to a spin-off in which either the distributing corporation or the spun-off corporation is a REIT and prevents a distributing corporation or a spun-off corporation from electing REIT status for a 10-year period following a tax-free spin-off. Under an effective date provision, the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the IRS before December 7, 2015. Because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request, we believe the legislation does not apply to the spin-off of Park. However, no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard. In particular, the IRS or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spin-offs. If the legislation applied to the spin-off of Park, either the spin-off would not qualify for tax-free treatment or Park would not be eligible to elect REIT status for a 10-year period following the spin-off. 
 
 If the spin-offs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, the Company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the spin-offs were taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Park and HGV would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. 
 
 36 

Park or HGV may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we executed as part of the spin-offs. 
 
 In connection with the spin-offs, we, Park and HGV entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, and, as to Park, management agreements, and, as to HGV, a license agreement. We are relying on Park and HGV to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. In addition, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us, Park and HGV and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to Park and to HGV, particularly if Park or HGV were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations. In connection with the spin-offs, each of Park and HGV indemnified us with respect to such parties assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. There can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of Park and HGV will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Park and HGV have agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Park or HGV any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we agreed to indemnify each of Park and HGV from certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Park and/or HGV may be significant and could negatively affect our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 
 Our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts, and could require us to divert our cash flows from operations to make required debt or interest payments. 
 
 We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately 8.8 billion, and our contractual debt maturities of our long-term debt for the years ending December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025 a re 39 million, 33 million and 526 million, respectively. Our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including: 
 
 requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities; 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; 
 
 exposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise; 
 
 exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest; 
 
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness; 
 
 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; 
 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of existing debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and 
 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting. 
 
 In December 2022, we amended the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities to reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as the primary benchmark rate for our variable-rate indebtedness under this agreement in lieu of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). SOFR is a relatively new reference rate with a limited history, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our variable-rate indebtedness may be difficult to predict. 
 37 

We are a holding company, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by, and most of our business is conducted through, our subsidiaries. Revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. If our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us, that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations. Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. As a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations. 
 
 Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control. 
 
 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures, to pay future dividends, if any, to our stockholders and repurchase our common stock will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. 
 
 Certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities. 
 
 The indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and/or the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: 
 
 incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; 
 
 pay dividends, including our subsidiaries paying dividends to us, and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; 
 
 make certain investments; 
 
 incur certain liens; 
 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; 
 
 merge or consolidate; 
 
 enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us; 
 
 designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and 
 
 transfer or sell assets. 
 
 In addition, the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters. 
 
 As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. 
 
 Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these 
 38 

borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above. 
 
 We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. Although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase. 
 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time. 
 
 Our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended payment of our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock beginning in 2020, but resumed our quarterly dividend payments in June 2022. The declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, limitations imposed by our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If we were to cease dividend payments, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that one might consider favorable. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things: 
 
 although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year, these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; 
 
 these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office; 
 
 these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our by-laws and that our stockholders may only amend our by-laws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and 
 
 these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
 
 Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.

 ____________ 
 (1) We own a controlling financial interest, but less than a 100 percent interest, in the entity that leases the property. 
 
 Corporate Headquarters and Regional Offices 
 
 Our corporate headquarters is located at 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102, which is under a lease agreement that expires in April 2037. We also own or lease corporate offices or centralized operations centers in Memphis, Tennessee; Glasgow, Scotland (Europe); Watford, England (Europe); Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Middle East and Africa); Singapore (Asia Pacific); Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; and Mexico City, Mexico. Additionally, we have support operations and other commercial services at a leased office in Addison, Texas. We believe that our existing office properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of our business. In the event we need to expand our operations, or upon expiration of our current leases, we believe that suitable space will be available on commercially reasonable terms. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums, including proceedings involving tort and other general liability claims, employee claims, consumer protection claims and claims related to our management of certain hotels. We recognize a liability when we believe the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Most occurrences involving liability, claims of negligence and employees are covered by policies that we hold with solvent insurance carriers. The ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. We believe we have adequate reserves against such matters. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period.

 Market Information and Dividends 
 
 Our common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HLT." As of December 31, 2022, there were seven holders of record of our common stock, which does not include a substantially greater number of beneficial holders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. 
 
 In June 2022, we resumed payment of our regular quarterly cash dividends, which we had suspended in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors, whose decision will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Because we are a holding company and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from funds we receive from our subsidiaries.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 For the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to "Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry beginning in 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the pervasiveness and severity of travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives have varied by country and state; however, as of December 31, 2022, most of the countries we operate in had eased or completely lifted such restrictions. While the pandemic negatively affected certain of our results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have experienced strong signs of recovery since early 2021, with comparable system-wide RevPAR in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 exceeding levels achieved in the same periods in 2019. Although all periods included in our consolidated financial statements presented in this Form 10-K were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, none of these periods are considered comparable, and no periods affected by the pandemic are expected to be comparable to future periods. 

Overview 
 
 Our Business 
 
 Hilton is one of the largest hospitality companies in the world, with 7,165 properties comprising 1,127,430 rooms in 123 countries and territories as of December 31, 2022. Our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury hotel brands, Waldorf Astoria Hotels Resorts, LXR Hotels Resorts and Conrad Hotels Resorts; our lifestyle hotel brands, Canopy by Hilton, Curio Collection by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, Tempo by Hilton and Motto by Hilton; our full service hotel brands, Signia by Hilton, Hilton Hotels Resorts and DoubleTree by Hilton; our focused service hotel brands, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton and Tru by Hilton; our all-suites hotel brands, Embassy Suites by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Home2 Suites by Hilton; our new premium economy brand, Spark by Hilton, launched in January 2023; and our timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations. As of December 31, 2022, we had 152 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, Hilton Honors, a 19 percent increase from December 31, 2021. 
 
 Segments and Regions 
 
 We analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. Our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products and services: (i) management and franchise; and (ii) ownership. The management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our IP. Revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and HGV for the right to use our IP; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. As a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for management fees. As a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservation system, marketing and information technology services, while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels. The ownership segment primarily derives revenues from nightly hotel room sales, food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. 
 
 Geographically, we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions: (i) the Americas; (ii) EMEA; and (iii) Asia Pacific. The Americas region includes North America, South America and Central America, including all Caribbean nations. Although the U.S., which represented 69 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of December 31, 2022, is included in the Americas region, it is often analyzed separately and apart from the Americas region and, as such, it is presented separately within the analysis herein. The EMEA region includes Europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of Eurasia stretching from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east, and the Middle East and Africa ("MEA"), which represents the Middle East region and all African nations, including the Indian Ocean island nations. Europe and MEA are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within the analysis herein. The Asia Pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of Asia, as well as India, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Island nations.

System Growth and Development Pipeline 
 
 Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global hotel network, as well as of our fee-based business. As we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with limited or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our IP. Prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. By increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with third-party owners, over time we expect to increase revenues, overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs. See further discussion on our cash management policy, as detailed in " Liquidity and Capital Resources." While these objectives have not changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current economic environment has posed certain challenges to the execution of our growth strategy, which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development. 
 
 In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our global hotel network through our development pipeline, which represents hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future. The following table summarizes our development activity: 
 
 As of or for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Hotels Rooms (1)

 ____________ 
 (1) Rounded to the nearest hundred. 
 (2) Represents room additions, net of rooms removed from our system, during the period, which contributed to net unit growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 4.7 percent. 
 (3) Hotels in our system were under development throughout 118 countries and territories, including 30 countries and territories where we did not currently have any existing hotels. 
 (4) In our development pipeline, as of December 31, 2022, 205,400 of the rooms were under construction and 243,500 of the rooms were located outside of the U.S. Nearly all of the rooms in our development pipeline will be in our management and franchise segment. We do not consider any individual development project to be material to us. 

Principal Components and Factors Affecting our Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Principal Components 
 
 We primarily derive our revenues from the following sources: 
 
 Franchise and licensing fees . Represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands, as well as fees from licensing agreements to use our IP. Under our long-term franchise contracts with hotel owners, franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include: (i) monthly royalty fees, generally based on a percentage of the hotel's monthly gross room revenue, and, in some cases, may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable; and (ii) application, initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system, when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended. Consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees. Our non-hotel licensing agreements, for which we receive licensing fees, are predominantly with strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and HGV. 
 
 Base and incentive management fees. Represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels. Terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base fee, which is typically based on a percentage 
 46 

of the hotel's monthly gross revenue and, when applicable, an incentive fee, which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel's operating profits, normally over a one-calendar year period, and, in some cases, may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner. Outside of the U.S., our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures, either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive fee, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. Consideration provided to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees. 
 
 Owned and leased hotels. Represents revenues derived from the operations of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including hotel room sales, accommodations sold in conjunction with other services, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. These revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. Transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. Group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions, which may be sponsored by corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations or associations. Group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meetings facilities and catering and banquet services. A majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels. As a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotels revenues. 
 
 Other revenues. Represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels, including our purchasing operations, and other operating income. 
 
 Other revenues from managed and franchised properties. Represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners, either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through monthly program fees related to certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties. The direct reimbursements by hotel owners are primarily for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally employed by us and certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations. We have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties, predominately those located outside of the U.S. Revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income (loss) or net income (loss). The monthly program fee that is paid by hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels that we manage is based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage, as reimbursement for the costs related to our: (i) advertising and marketing programs; (ii) internet, technology and reservation systems; and (iii) quality assurance programs. Other revenues from managed and franchised properties also includes revenues related to our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program, which are primarily derived from payments from hotel franchisees and third-party owners of hotels we manage that participate in the program, as well as co-branded credit card providers. We are contractually required to use these fees that we collect solely for these programs. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Revenues 
 
 The following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations: 
 
 Consumer demand and global economic conditions . Consumer demand for our products and services, as well as the products and services of the third parties from which we earn licensing fees, is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Among other factors, declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks reducing or otherwise negatively affecting travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can reduce the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate and/or reduce the revenues and profitability of the operations of our owned and leased hotels. Further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers of our hotels. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several of these factors, as well as health and safety concerns, had a significant effect on global economic conditions and consumer demand for our products and services; however, we have experienced significant recovery in demand during 2022. Also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profitability measures. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected, are currently subjecting and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility. 
 
 Contracts with third-party hotel owners and franchisees and relationships with developers . We depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and hotel franchisees for our management and 
 47 

franchise fee revenues. The success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and franchisees. Our relationships with these third parties allow us to maintain our current presence as contracts mature and also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth. Growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. We believe that we generally have good relationships with our third-party hotel owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. These relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Principal Components 
 
 We primarily incur the following expenses: 
 
 Owned and leased hotels. Reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expenses, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. Room expenses include compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff, as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. Food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory. Other support expenses include: costs associated with property-level management; utilities; sales and marketing; operating hotel spas; operating telephones, parking and other guest recreation; entertainment; and other services. Property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. These are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of: (i) amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of Blackstone Inc. (the "Merger"), which primarily include values assigned to management contracts, leases and our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program intangible asset; (ii) amortization of capitalized software costs; and (iii) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including our finance lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels. 
 
 General and administrative. Consists primarily of compensation costs for our corporate employees, including share-based compensation; professional fees, including consulting, audit and legal fees; travel and entertainment expenses; bad debt expenses for uncollectible management, franchise and other fees; and administrative and related expenses. 
 
 Other expenses . Consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations and other ancillary businesses, along with other operating expenses of the business. 
 
 Other expenses from managed and franchised properties. Represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by hotel owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally employed by us, or paid from program fees collected from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed properties' operations, including those related to our brands and shared services programs. We are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs. We have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed hotels, predominately those located outside of the U.S. Other expenses from managed and franchised properties also includes expenses for the operation of our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Costs and Expenses 
 
 The following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations: 
 
 Fixed expenses. Many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, including that which resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 48 

Economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. Employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. In addition, any efforts to reduce costs, including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. Additionally, the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. The effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs. However, we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions, while continuing to optimize value for the experiences of our customers, owners and Hilton employees, supporting the long-term sustainability of our brands and business. 
 
 Changes in depreciation and amortization expenses. We capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and, as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase. As the finite-lived intangible assets that were recorded at the Merger become fully amortized, amortization expense will decrease. Additionally, changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels or corporate facilities through sale, closure or lease termination, lease renewals, expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. As we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. If we are required to recognize impairment losses related to our depreciable assets or finite-lived intangible assets, the related depreciation or amortization expense, respectively, will decrease. 
 
 Other Items 
 
 Effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
 
 Significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is USD, and we have assets and liabilities, including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries, denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. As a result, we are required to translate the results of those operations, assets and liabilities from their functional currency into USD at market-based foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period. When comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods. We hedge foreign currency exchange-based cash flow variability of certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments. We also hold short-term forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances and intercompany financing arrangements, and we have not currently elected to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. While results were less predictable as a result of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions, based on historical results, we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters. 

Key Business and Financial Metrics Used by Management 
 
 Comparable Hotels 
 
 We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open January 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results were not available. Of the 7,085 hotels in our system as of December 31, 2022, 5,797 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. Our 1,288 non-comparable hotels included 272 hotels, or less than four percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, underwent large-scale capital projects or comparable results were otherwise not available. 
 
 49 

When considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels, no hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic was excluded from the definition of comparable hotels on that basis alone. Despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations, we believe that including these hotels within our hotel operating statistics of occupancy, average daily rate ("ADR") and revenue per available room ("RevPAR"), if they would have otherwise been included, reflects the underlying results of our business for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Occupancy 
 
 Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. Occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. Management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help management determine achievable ADR pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases. 
 
 ADR 
 
 ADR represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. ADR measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use ADR to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above. 
 
 RevPAR 
 
 RevPAR is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels. 
 
 References to occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of December 31, 2022, and references to ADR and RevPAR are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. As such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 or 2019 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the Company's foreign operations within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("FF E") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items. 
 
 We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. For instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude items such as: (i) FF E replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and 
 50 

amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our operating performance. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with GAAP. Further, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including: 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; 
 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 
 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 
 Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Results of Operations 
 The hotel operating statistics by region for our system-wide comparable hotels were as follows: 
 
 Year Ended Change December 31, 2022 2022 vs. 2021 U.S. Occupancy 69.9 8.8 pts. ADR 157.44 19.3 RevPAR 110.09 36.5 Americas (excluding U.S.) Occupancy 63.8 20.6 pts. ADR 138.55 28.5 RevPAR 88.44 89.8 Europe Occupancy 67.0 25.6 pts. ADR 147.00 43.8 RevPAR 98.51 132.5 MEA Occupancy 66.6 14.6 pts. ADR 154.57 21.7 RevPAR 102.99 56.0 Asia Pacific Occupancy 53.2 2.4 pts. ADR 103.73 13.8 RevPAR 55.17 19.1 System-wide Occupancy 67.5 10.3 pts. ADR 151.01 20.6 RevPAR 101.90 42.5 
 
 We experienced significant improvement in our results during the year ended December 31, 2022 with the continued recovery of the travel and hospitality industry from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rebound of cross-border international travel. On a regional basis, the Europe region had the most significant improvement when compared to 2021, with continental Europe leading the region with meaningful increases in both ADR and occupancy. Further, despite the impact of the limited demand in China due to prolonged travel restrictions, the remainder of the APAC region demonstrated a strong recovery, particularly during the second half of the year. Overall, leisure transient was the primary driver of improved performance during the year, but all customer segments, including business and group travel, contributed to our recovery. 
 
 On a system-wide basis, our recovery was particularly strong during the second half of 2022, driven by an upward trend in both ADR and occupancy. The third quarter of 2022 was the first period since the beginning of the pandemic that system-wide RevPAR on a comparable and currency neutral basis exceeded system-wide RevPAR for the same period in 2019, and system-wide RevPAR for the fourth quarter of 2022 also exceeded the same period in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 1.3 percent due to a decrease in occupancy of 6.2 percentage points, partially offset by an increase in ADR of 7.8 percent. All regions showed improvement in ADR during the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to 2019, with the exception of Asia Pacific, primarily as a result of limitations on travel in China.

The table below provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Net income 1,257 407 Interest expense 415 397 Income tax expense 477 153 Depreciation and amortization expenses 162 188 EBITDA 2,311 1,145 Loss on sales of assets, net 7 Loss (gain) on foreign currency transactions (5) 7 Loss on debt extinguishment 69 FF E replacement reserves 54 48 Share-based compensation expense 162 193 Amortization of contract acquisition costs 38 32 Net other expenses from managed and franchised properties 39 110 Other adjustments (1) 
 18 Adjusted EBITDA 2,599 1,629 
 ____________ 
 (1) Amount for the year ended December 31, 2022 was less than 1 million and includes net losses (gains) related to certain of Hilton's investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes costs recognized for certain legal settlements. All periods include severance and other items. 

Revenues 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Franchise and licensing fees 2,068 1,493 38.5 Base and other management fees 
 294 176 67.0 Incentive management fees 
 196 98 100.0 Total management fees 490 274 78.8 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue recognized from fees increased primarily as a result of improved demand for travel and tourism, including the ability and desire of our customers to travel, due to the ongoing recovery that began in early 2021 from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Accordingly, on a comparable basis, franchise and management fees increased as a result of increases in RevPAR of 34.8 percent and 69.0 percent at our comparable franchised and managed properties, respectively. These increases were a result of increased occupancy of 8.7 percentage points and 15.0 percentage points, respectively, and increased ADR of 18.0 percent and 27.1 percent, respectively. 
 
 Further, as new hotels enter our system, we expect such hotels to increase our franchise and management fees. Including new development and ownership type transfers, from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022, we added over 670 franchised and managed properties on a net basis, providing an additional 105,300 rooms to our management and franchise segment, which also contributed to the increases in franchise and management fees. 
 
 The rise in travel and tourism and increased overall consumer spending during the year ended December 31, 2022 also contributed to a significant increase in licensing and other fees from our strategic partnerships and HGV. Increased fees from our strategic partnerships resulted from new cardholder acquisitions, as well as increased cardholder spend under our co-branded credit card arrangements and increased fees from HGV resulted from increased timeshare revenues, which, in addition to the recovery from the pandemic, were attributable to the increase in timeshare properties in our system during the period. 

53 

Incentive management fees increased as they are based on hotels' operating profits, which have improved from the prior year as a result of increased demand in line with the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and higher revenues driving higher managed hotel profits. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Owned and leased hotels revenues 1,076 598 79.9 
 
 The increase in owned and leased hotels revenues included increases of 489 million and 74 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by an 85 million decrease as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The currency neutral increase in revenues from our comparable leased hotels was primarily the result of increased RevPAR of 168.2 percent, due to increases in occupancy of 30.8 percentage points and ADR of 34.1 percent, reflective of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was particularly strong during 2022 in Europe where the majority of our leased properties are located. The currency neutral increase in revenues from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels, which also benefited from an increase in RevPAR, was partially offset by a 35 million decrease, on a currency neutral basis, from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Other revenues 102 79 29.1 
 
 The increase in other revenues was primarily due to increased revenues from our purchasing operations related to improved hotel demand resulting from the rise in travel and tourism during 2022. 

Operating Expenses 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Owned and leased hotels expenses 
 999 679 47.1 
 
 The increase in owned and leased hotels expenses included increases of 358 million and 49 million, on a currency neutral basis, from our comparable and non-comparable owned and leased hotels, respectively, which were partially offset by a 87 million decrease as a result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The currency neutral increase in expenses from our non-comparable owned and leased hotels was net of a 30 million currency neutral decrease from properties which were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated during 2021. 
 
 Our owned and leased hotels had currency neutral increases in certain operating expenses as a result of increased occupancy, including labor costs, utilities and variable rent, which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits, which increased in line with the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we incurred increased expenses related to FF E replacement reserves, which are generally computed as a percentage of hotel revenues. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Depreciation and amortization expenses 162 188 (13.8) General and administrative expenses 382 405 (5.7) Other expenses 60 45 33.3 
 
 54 

The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense, driven by the full amortization of certain software project costs during 2021 and 2022. 
 
 The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to continued cost control and decreased share-based compensation expense, as well as costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 for certain legal settlements, for which no such expenses were recognized during 2022. 
 
 The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher volume in our purchasing operations related to improved hotel demand. 

Non-operating Income and Expenses

 Income tax expense (477) (153) NM (1) 
 
 ____________ 
 (1) Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful. 
 
 The increase in interest expense included increases related to the interest rate increase on the variable rate senior secured term loan facility (the "Term Loan") during the period and the amortization of previously dedesignated interest rate swaps. These increases were partially offset by a decrease related to our senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which was partially drawn during 2021, but was fully repaid as of June 30, 2021 with no outstanding balance for the remainder of 2021 or at all during 2022, as well as a decrease resulting from the February 2021 issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes, which reduced the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding senior unsecured notes. See Note 8: "Debt" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and the associated interest rates. 
 
 The gains and losses on foreign currency transactions included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany financing arrangements, including short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, and other transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
 Loss on debt extinguishment related to the February 2021 redemption of senior unsecured notes and included a redemption premium of 55 million and the accelerated recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs on those senior unsecured notes of 14 million. 
 
 Other non-operating income, net consists of interest income, equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates, certain components of net periodic pension cost or credit related to our employee defined benefit pension plans and other non-operating gains and losses. The increase in other non-operating income, net was primarily due to an 11 million gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting from the remeasurement of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates, as well as an increase in interest income due to increases in interest rates during the period. 
 
 The increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to the increase in income before income taxes. Further, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized tax benefits as a result of the change in tax rate implemented as part of the United Kingdom's Finance Act 2021. For additional information, see Note 12: "Income Taxes" in our consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total cash and cash equivalents of 1,286 million, including 77 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for FF E reserves. 
 
 Our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including: 
 
 costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels; 
 
 corporate expenses; 
 
 payroll and compensation costs; 
 
 taxes and compliance costs; 
 
 scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to be approximately 427 million in 2023; 
 
 lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to be approximately 47 million and 147 million, respectively, in 2023; 
 
 costs, other than compensation and rent as noted separately, associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels, including, but not limited to, utilities and operating supplies; 
 
 committed contract acquisition costs; 
 
 capital and maintenance expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment; 
 
 dividends as declared; and 
 
 share repurchases. 
 
 Our known long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for: 
 
 scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, which, excluding finance lease liabilities, are estimated to total an aggregate of 10.5 billion after December 31, 2023; 
 
 lease payments under our finance and operating leases, which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to total an aggregate of 150 million and 1,068 million, respectively, after December 31, 2023; 
 
 committed contract acquisition costs; 
 
 capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment; 
 
 corporate capital and information technology expenditures; 
 
 dividends as declared; 
 
 56 

share repurchases; and 
 
 commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these owners through program fees to operate our marketing, sales and brands programs. 
 
 In March 2022, we resumed share repurchases, which we had previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since they were resumed, as of December 31, 2022, we had repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of our common stock for 1,608 million. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 3.1 billion remained available for share repurchases under our stock repurchase program. In June 2022, we resumed payment of regular quarterly cash dividends, which we had also previously suspended in an effort to preserve cash during the pandemic. 
 
 In circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objective of growing our global hotel network, we may provide performance or debt guarantees or loan commitments, as necessary, to owners of certain hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise, as applicable, as well as letters of credit that support hotel financing or other obligations of hotel owners. See Note 18: "Commitments and Contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these commitments that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 We have a long-term investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Within the framework of our investment policy, we currently intend to continue to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, cash generated from our operations and, as needed, the use of the available capacity of our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing as a source of liquidity as required and to extend maturities of existing borrowings, as necessary. 
 
 After considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash, we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and other compensation costs, taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions. The objectives of our cash management policy are maintaining the availability of liquidity and minimizing operational costs. 
 
 We may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt and/or purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Issuances or incurrence of new debt (or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt) and/or purchases or retirements of outstanding debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Our Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The following table summarizes our net cash flows: 
 
 Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,681 109 NM (1) 
 Net cash used in investing activities (123) (57) NM (1) 
 Net cash used in financing activities (1,765) (1,793) (1.6) 
 ____________ 
 (1) Fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful; see additional details below. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment, largely as a result of an increase in RevPAR at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 41.2 percent. Additionally, there was a 119 million decrease in payments of contract acquisition costs based on the timing of certain strategic hotel developments supporting our net unit growth. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a 208 million increase in cash paid for income taxes primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes. 
 57 

In April 2020, we pre-sold Hilton Honors points to American Express and, before the end of the second quarter of 2022, all of those points had been used by American Express. As such, American Express resumed purchasing Hilton Honors points with cash in connection with a co-branded credit card arrangement with them, which contributed approximately 400 million to the increase in our operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect American Express to continue to purchase points with cash under the co-branded credit card arrangement in future periods. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities primarily included: (i) capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations; (ii) capital expenditures for property and equipment related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment; and (iii) equity and debt financing that we provided to unconsolidated affiliates and owners of hotels that we currently or in the future will manage or franchise to support our strategic objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the net cash inflows resulting from our undesignated derivative financial instruments that we have in place to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily as a result of the British pound depreciating against the USD during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to the return of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases, which resumed in March 2022, and quarterly dividend payments, which resumed in June 2022, after both programs were suspended in 2020. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily comprised the full repayment of the 1.69 billion outstanding debt balance on our Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the debt issuance costs and redemption premiums associated with the issuance of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemption of previously outstanding senior unsecured notes. 
 
 Debt and Borrowing Capacity 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately 8.8 billion, and we had 60 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of 1,690 million. In January 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility to increase the borrowing capacity from 1.75 billion to 2.0 billion, 250 million of which is available in the form of letters of credit, and, based on the terms of the agreement, we expect the extended maturity date to be January 2028. As of February 3, 2023, after considering 60 million letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding, we had an available borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility of 1,940 million . For additional information on our total indebtedness, including any applicable guarantees, refer to Note 8: "Debt" in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. However, we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to May 2025. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances. While we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
 
 We believe that the following estimates, which are used in conjunction with our significant accounting policies, are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and are based on information that is inherently uncertain; refer to Note 2: "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our consolidated financial statements for 
 58 

information on our significant accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the board of directors: 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Brands Intangible Assets 
 
 We evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in Note 17: "Business Segments" in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment, we exercise judgment to: 
 
 perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value. Factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations and historical experience; 
 
 decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. Factors we consider when making this determination include changes in the Company or general economic conditions since the previous quantitative assessment was performed, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at that time and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment; and 
 
 perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment loss. The estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of the reporting unit or brand, as applicable. 
 
 Changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material. 
 
 Impairment of Certain Finite-Lived Assets 
 
 We evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets, operating and finance lease ROU assets and property and equipment for indicators of impairment, and, if such indicators exist, we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the determined asset group, by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the asset group. 
 
 As part of the process, we exercise judgment to: 
 
 determine if there are indicators of impairment present. Factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, regional performance and expectations, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information; 
 
 determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present. Judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated performance over the expected useful life of the asset group. Forward-looking estimates of future performance are based on historical operating results, adjusted for current and expected future market conditions, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and 
 
 determine the asset group fair value when required. In determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models, appraisals, recent similar transactions in the market and, if appropriate and available for a specific asset group, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. The discount rate applied to forward-looking projections takes into account market-specific considerations. 
 
 59 

Changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis, or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect these estimates and assumptions, such as those described above, could result in impairment losses, which could be material. 
 
 Hilton Honors 
 
 We record a point redemption liability for amounts received from properties participating in our Hilton Honors guest loyalty program and from strategic partners affiliated with the loyalty program, in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation. We engage third-party actuaries annually to assist in determining the fair value of the future reward redemption obligation using a discount rate and statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment, including: (i) an estimate of points that will eventually be redeemed, which includes an estimate of breakage (i.e., points that will never be redeemed); (ii) the expectation of when such points will be redeemed; and (iii) the cost of reimbursing properties and other third parties when points are redeemed. The cost of the points expected to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights, occupancy rates, room rates and any changes to the Hilton Honors program, including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward. Any amounts received related to the issuance of points that are in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue upon point redemption. We recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point, inclusive of estimated breakage, and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs. 
 
 In addition to the Hilton Honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program, we earn fees from strategic partnerships, including co-branded credit card arrangements, for a license to use our IP and the issuance of Hilton Honors points. The allocation of the overall fees from the strategic partnerships between the IP license and the Hilton Honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices. The estimated standalone selling price of the IP license is determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation method incorporating statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment, including estimates of the usage of the strategic partner's goods or services, an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate applied to the projected cash flows. The estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of Hilton Honors points under the strategic partnerships is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above, adjusted for an appropriate margin. 
 
 Changes in our estimates and assumptions that are used to determine our estimated cost per point and the allocation of fees from strategic partnerships between the IP license fee and the Hilton Honors points could result in material changes in the balances of our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets. Further, the estimates and assumptions used for the allocation of fees could result in material changes to our licensing fees and other revenues from managed and franchised properties recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. We regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 12: "Income Taxes" for information on the balances of our deferred tax assets and respective valuation allowances as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 We use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements. When determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized, we assume, among other items, the position will be examined, the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position will be based on its technical merits. Further, estimates based on the technical merits of each evaluated tax position and the amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit (expense), which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 60 

Legal Contingencies 
 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss in determining whether an accrual of an estimated loss is appropriate. Changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These rate changes may affect future income, cash flows and the fair value of the Company, its assets and its liabilities. In certain situations, we may seek to reduce volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet the objectives described above, and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable-rate indebtedness. Our primary sensitivity in 2022 was to changes in one-month LIBOR, as the interest rate on our Term Loan, which represents the majority of our variable-rate indebtedness, was based on this benchmark rate until we amended the credit agreement that governs our Term Loan in December 2022 to adjust our LIBOR-based variable rate to a SOFR-based variable rate. We use an interest rate swap in order to maintain what we believe to be an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability. As of December 31, 2022, we held an interest rate swap for a portion of the Term Loan, for which we executed an amendment concurrent with the amendment for our Term Loan, through which we receive one-month term SOFR and pay a fixed rate. We elected to designate this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and applied the practical expedient as prescribed in ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting that allowed us to maintain hedge accounting with the transition to SOFR. 
 
 The following table sets forth the current carrying values of our contractual maturities, total fair values and interest rates as of December 31, 2022 for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk, including long-term debt and our interest rate swap: 
 
 Maturities by Period 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Carrying Value Fair Value (dollars in millions) Long-term debt (1) :

 (1) The carrying values exclude the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and any applicable discounts, as well as all finance lease liabilities and other debt of consolidated VIEs totaling 164 million and 37 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 
 (2) The fixed interest rate is the weighted average of actual rates, and the variable interest rate is based on the market rate prevailing as of December 31, 2022. 
 (3) The variable interest rate receivable on the interest rate swap does not include fixed components of the overall variable interest rate, including applicable spreads. 
 (4) The carrying value reflects the notional amount and the variable interest rate receivable is based on the market rate prevailing as of December 31, 2022. We measure our derivative instruments at fair value and, as of December 31, 2022, our interest rate swap was in an asset position. 
 
 Refer to Note 10: "Fair Value Measurements" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value measurements of our long-term debt and interest rate swap. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies, as well as revenues and expenses from our international leased hotels. The value of these revenues and expenses could change materially in relation to the functional currencies of the exposed entities and to our reporting currency, USD. We also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities, including certain intercompany financing arrangements 
 62 

not deemed to be permanently invested, the value of which could change materially in relation to the functional currencies of the exposed entities. As of December 31, 2022, our largest net exposures were to GBP and EUR. 
 
 We use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with certain of our management, franchise and other fees denominated in certain foreign currencies. We use forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in certain cash and intercompany loan balances . We do not consider the fair value or earnings effect of these forward contracts to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Ernst Young LLP (PCAOB ID: ), the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report is included herein.

In our opinion, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders' equity (deficit) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes, and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders equity (deficit) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Accounting for the Loyalty Program Description of the Matter The Company recognized 457 million of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022 and had deferred revenues of 631 million and a liability for guest loyalty program of 2,395 million as of December 31, 2022 associated with the Hilton Honors guest loyalty and marketing program (the Loyalty Program ). As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a performance obligation to provide or arrange for the provision of goods or services, for free or at a discount, to Hilton Honors members in exchange for the redemption of points earned through participation in the Loyalty Program. The consideration for the Loyalty Program is received from hotel properties or other program partners at the time points are earned by Hilton Honors members. Such amounts are recognized as revenue when the related point obligation is satisfied based upon the estimated standalone selling price per point in excess of the related cost per point. 
 
 Auditing Loyalty Program results is complex due to: (1) the complexity of models and high volume of data used to monitor and account for the Loyalty Program results, and (2) the complexity of estimating the standalone selling price per Loyalty Program point, including the estimated breakage rate of Loyalty Program points. Such estimates are complex given the significant estimation associated with expected future redemption activity. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process of accounting for the Loyalty Program during the year. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the assumptions and data inputs utilized by third-party actuaries to assist the Company in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation and breakage rate of Loyalty Program points and management s review of activity and data inputs to their accounting model. 
 
 To test the recognition of revenues and costs associated with the Loyalty Program, we involved specialists on our team and performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the clerical accuracy and consistency with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles of the accounting model developed by the Company to recognize revenue and costs associated with the Loyalty Program. We tested significant inputs into the accounting model, including the estimated standalone selling price and recognition of points earned and redeemed during the period. We involved our actuarial professionals to assist in our testing procedures with respect to the estimate of the breakage of Loyalty Program points and the ultimate estimated redemption cost. We evaluated management s methodology for estimating the breakage of Loyalty Program points, as well as tested underlying data and assumptions used in estimating the breakage rate. 
 
 Accounting for Income Taxes Description of the Matter The Company recognized income tax expense of 477 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, and unrecognized tax benefits of 337 million as of December 31, 2022. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, for all tax positions taken in a tax return, the Company will first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If the Company determines that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. 
 
 Auditing the accounting for income taxes is complex as a result of: (1) operations in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions and international restructuring transactions, (2) the judgment and estimation associated with both the identification and measurement of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, including its evaluation of the technical merits related to matters for which no reserves or partial reserves have been recorded, and (3) the significant estimation associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits outstanding as of the balance sheet date. 

68 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process of accounting for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, during the year. For example, we tested management s controls over the review of tax positions taken by the Company to determine whether they met the threshold for recognition within the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 To test the recognition of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assess the technical merits of the Company s tax positions and performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluation of communications with relevant taxing authorities, evaluation of whether management appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the unrecognized tax benefits, and testing the assumptions used by management in estimating the valuation of any associated liability. 
 
 Accounting for Other Expenses from Managed and Franchised Properties and General and Administrative Expenses Description of the Matter The Company recognized Other expenses from managed and franchised properties of 5,076 million and General and administrative expenses of 382 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company incurs certain direct and indirect expenses that are for the benefit of, and contractually reimbursable from, hotel owners. Such amounts Cost Reimbursements are recorded in the peri od in which the expense is incurred as Other expenses from managed and franchised properties, and the accounting for indirect cost reimbursements includes judgment with respect to the allocation of certain costs between reimbursable and non-reimbursable. 
 
 Auditing the classification of indirect reimbursements recognized within Other expenses from managed and franchised properties and General and administrative expenses is complex as a result of: (1) judgment associated with testing management s conclusions regarding the allocation of costs between reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses, presented as Other expenses from managed and franchised properties and General and administrative expenses, respectively, and (2) the complexity associated with allocating indirect expenses due to the high volume of data utilized by management in establishing and maintaining allocations for indirect expenses. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process of accounting for Cost Reimbursements, General and administrative expenses, and the process for allocating indirect reimbursement expenses during the year. For example, we tested management s controls over the review of the allocation of certain indirect costs to determine if they were appropriately classified. 
 
 To test the recognition of Cost Reimbursements for appropriate classification, we performed audit procedures that included, among others: testing a sample of transactions that were classified within Other expenses from managed and franchised properties in order to evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment and reasonableness of classification; comparing budgeted amounts and initial allocations to actual activity and evaluating the reasonableness of any resulting material changes to allocations of indirect expenses; performing analytical procedures over Other expenses from managed and franchised properties and General and administrative expenses in order to identify indicators of material errors in the classification of expenses based on established trends and expectations; and testing material manual journal entries made to Other expenses from managed and franchised properties and General and administrative expenses.

In our consolidated statement of operations, the amortization of these intangible assets, excluding contract acquisition costs, is included in depreciation and amortization expenses, and the amortization of contract acquisition costs is recognized as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees or base and other management fees, depending on the contract type. Costs incurred prior to the acquisition of a contract, such as external legal costs, are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.

 We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment for indicators of impairment, and, if such indicators exist, we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable and it exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group, we recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. We allocate the impairment loss related to the asset group among the various assets within the asset group pro rata based on the relative carrying values of the respective assets.

 As of December 31, 2021, one of our consolidated VIEs had drawn million JPY (equivalent to million) under a revolving credit facility, which was fully repaid by July 2022; these borrowings were included in long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

 Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
 
 Our senior secured credit facilities consist of a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and a senior secured term loan facility. The obligations of our senior secured credit facilities are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Parent and substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, except for HOC, the named borrower on the senior secured credit facilities. 
 
 In December 2022, we amended the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities to reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the primary benchmark rate for our variable-rate indebtedness under this agreement in lieu of the London Interbank Offered Rate. We applied the practical expedient as prescribed in ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting that allowed us to consider this amendment as though the modification was not substantial. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our Revolving Credit Facility had a total borrowing capacity of billion and, of the million available in the form of letters of credit, million letters of credit were outstanding, resulting in an available borrowing capacity of million. No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. In January 2023, we amended the credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility to increase the borrowing capacity to billion, million of which is available in the form of letters of credit, and, based on the terms of the agreement, we expect the extended maturity date to be January 2028. In connection with this amendment, we incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs. As of February 3, 2023, after considering million letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding, we had an available borrowing capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility of million . 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 During 2021 and 2020, we completed financing transactions, whereby we issued senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds from those issuances, together with available cash, to redeem outstanding senior unsecured notes. In connection with

million and million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and accelerated the recognition of the unamortized deferred financing costs on the redeemed notes of million and million, respectively. These amounts were included in loss on debt extinguishments in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2020, we also issued in aggregate billion of senior unsecured notes.

 We measure our interest rate swaps at fair value, which was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swaps, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs of similar instruments, including interest rate curves, as applicable. 
 
 Our nonfinancial assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2020, and for which we recorded impairment losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, were primarily related to certain hotel properties under operating and finance leases and goodwill, all of which were part of our ownership reporting unit. See Note 5: "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," Note 6: "Property and Equipment" and Note 11: "Leases" for additional information on these impairment losses. 
 
 For the quantitative analysis of goodwill that was performed during the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimated the fair value of the ownership reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses and significant level 3 unobservable inputs, which included an estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting unit's expected future cash flows, a stabilized growth rate after recovery and the present value of the reporting unit's terminal value. The expected future cash flows were discounted using a discount rate that reflected the market rate of return. As a result of the non-recurring fair value measurement, we fully impaired the goodwill attributable to our ownership reporting unit, recognizing impairment losses of million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimated the fair value of assets related to certain hotel properties under operating and finance leases, including related lease intangible assets, operating and finance lease ROU assets and property and equipment, using discounted cash flow analyses and significant level 3 unobservable inputs, which included an estimate of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each leased property based on the expected recovery term, stabilized growth rates after recovery and discount rates reflecting the risk profile of the underlying cash flows and the individual markets where the assets are located. As a result of these non-recurring fair value measurements, we recognized impairment losses on these assets of million in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.

 As of December 31, 2022, we had gross U.S. separate return limitation year loss carryforwards and foreign operating loss carryforwards of billion, resulting in deferred tax assets of million. Approximately million of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 related to loss carryforwards that will expire between with less than of that amount expiring in 2023. Approximately million of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 resulted from loss carryforwards that are not subject to expiration. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain U.S. and foreign loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this assessment, we provided valuation allowances totaling million as of December 31, 2022 on the deferred tax assets relating to these loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, we also had deferred tax assets for U.S. tax credit carryforwards of million that will expire between 2029 and 2032, for which we have provided valuation allowances.

 As of December 31, 2021, we had entered into a tentative agreement with the IRS, subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation, to settle our federal examination through the 2010 tax year, and the settlement was approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation during the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the extended federal statute of limitations for tax years from 2005 through 2010 is set to expire in 2023. The assets and liabilities relating to the settlement were previously recognized as of December 31, 2021, and no adjustments were necessary as a result of the settlement approval. 
 
 We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax benefit (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized income tax expense related to interest and penalties of million, million and million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had accrued approximately million and million, respectively, for interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits in our consolidated balance sheets. Included in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were million and million, respectively, associated with positions that, if favorably resolved, would provide a benefit to our effective income tax rate. As a result of the expected resolution of examination issues with foreign tax authorities, we believe it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to million.

 The investment objectives for the various plans are preservation of capital, current income and long-term growth of capital. All plan assets are managed by third-party investment managers and do not include investments in Hilton stock. Asset allocations are reviewed periodically by the investment managers. 
 
 Expected long-term returns on plan assets are determined using historical performance for debt and equity securities held by our plans, actual performance of plan assets and current and expected market conditions. Expected returns are formulated based on the target asset allocation. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the target asset allocation, as a percentage of total plan assets, for the Domestic Plan was percent and percent, respectively, in funds that invest in equity securities and percent and percent, respectively, in funds that invest in debt securities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the target asset allocation, as a percentage of total plan assets, for the U.K. Plan and International Plans was percent in funds that invest in equity and debt securities and percent in bond funds.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 included the reversal of expense recognized in prior years as a result of the determination that the performance conditions of our then-outstanding performance shares were no longer probable of achievement. Further, in December 2020, we modified our then-outstanding performance shares in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to reward for results achieved prior to the pandemic and incentivize our recovery efforts, with a portion of the awards modified to vest based on continued service and the remaining portion of the awards to vest based on new performance measures. As a result of this modification, our share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes incremental share-based compensation of million, million and million, respectively. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation costs for unvested awards under the 2017 Plan were approximately million, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years on a straight-line basis.

 The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels that license our IP and where we provide other contracted services to third-party owners, but the day-to-day services of the hotels are operated or managed by someone other than us. Revenues from this segment include: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) licensing fees from our strategic partners, including co-branded credit card providers, and HGV for the right to use our IP; and (iii) fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment. As of December 31, 2022, this segment included managed hotels and franchised hotels consisting of total rooms. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our ownership segment included properties totaling rooms. The segment comprised hotels that we leased, hotels that were each leased by a consolidated VIE and hotels owned or leased by unconsolidated affiliates. In December 2022, non-wholly owned consolidated hotel and of our leased hotels exited our system, and, therefore, they are not included in the number of owned and leased hotels as of December 31, 2022, although the results of operations of the hotels are consolidated in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the period prior to their exit. 
 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of certain of our hotels were suspended for some period of time. However, substantially all of the hotels in our management and franchise segment had re-opened by the end of 2021 and have remained open and operating since then. All of the hotels in our ownership segment that had suspended operations at some point in time as a result of the pandemic were open as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 The performance of our operating segments is evaluated primarily on operating income (loss), without allocating amortization of contract acquisition costs, other revenues and other expenses, other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties, depreciation and amortization expenses or general and administrative expenses, and does not include equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates. Our chief operating decision maker does not use assets by operating segment when assessing performance or making operating segment resource allocations.

Except as provided in Section 2.14(a), each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of (A) if such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is denominated in Dollars, 2,000,000, or a whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof, (B) if such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is denominated in Sterling, 1,000,000, or a whole multiple of 500,000 in excess thereof, (C) if such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is denominated in euros, 2,000,000, or a whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof, (D) if such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is denominated in Australian Dollars, A 2,000,000, or a whole multiple of A 1,000,000 in excess thereof and (E) if such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is denominated in Yen, 2,000,000,000, or a whole multiple of 1,000,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c), 2.04(c), 2.14(a) or the last sentence of this paragraph, each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 500,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing of a particular Class, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans of any Class or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans of a Class or Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted, (v) in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, the relevant Approved Currency in which such Revolving Credit Borrowing is to be denominated and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify an Approved Currency of a Loan in a Committed Loan Notice, such Loan shall be made in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as or converted to (x) in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, Base Rate Loans or (y) in the case of any Loan denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans in the Approved Currency, and with respect to Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency, having an Interest Period of one month, as applicable. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or one-month Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in another Approved Currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original Approved Currency or reborrowed in another Approved Currency. 
 (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount (and Approved Currency) of its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. The Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent by wire transfer of such funds in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. 
 71 

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.05 in connection therewith. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require that no Loans in any Approved Currency may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. 
 (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the announcement of such change. 
 (e) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than fifteen (15) Interest Periods in effect. 
 (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

 (iii) An L C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit. 
 (iv) Each L C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each L C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in 
 73 

Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and any Letter of Credit Issuance Request (and any other document, agreement or instrument entered into by such L C Issuer and the Borrower or in favor of such L C Issuer) pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article IX included such L C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to each L C Issuer. 
 (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an L C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Issuance Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or his her delegate or designee. Such Letter of Credit Issuance Request must be received by the relevant L C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 1 00 p.m. (New York City time) at least two Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be or, in each case, such other date and time as the relevant L C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuance Request shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L C Issuer (a) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day) (b) the amount thereof (c) the relevant Approved Currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated (d) the expiry date thereof (e) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof (f) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder (g) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder and (h) such other matters as the relevant L C Issuer may reasonably request.

 (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Issuance Request, the relevant L C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Issuance Request from the Borrower and, if not, such L C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the relevant L C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the relevant L C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
 (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Issuance Request, the relevant L C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a number of days (the Non-Extension Notice Date prior to the last day of such twelve month period to be agreed upon by the relevant L C Issuer and the Borrower at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L C Issuer, the Borrower 
 74 

shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date provided that the relevant L C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the relevant L C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied. 
 (iv) Promptl y after issuance of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 (c) Drawings and Reimbursements Funding of Participations. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the L C Issuer in such Approved Currency, unless the L C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the L C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 1 00 p.m. (New York City time), in the case of a drawing in Dollars, or 2 00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9 00 a.m. New York city time), in the case of a drawing in an Approved Foreign Currency, on (1) the next Business Day immediately following any payment by an L C Issuer under a Letter of Credit that the Borrower receives notice thereof (each such date, an Honor Date ), the Borrower shall reimburse such L C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in the relevant Approved Currency provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Credit Borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility or a Swing Line Borrowing under the Swing Line Facility in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as applicable. In the event that (x) a drawing denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.03(c)(i) and (y) the Dollar amount paid by the Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the applicable Approved Foreign Currency equal to the drawing, the Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the L C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Approved Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof) (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Appropriate Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans, as applicable, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Appropriate Lenders and the conditions set 
 75 

forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (ii) Each Appropriate Lender (including any Lender acting as an L C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer in Dollars at the Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2 00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Appropriate Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan that is a Base Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan, as applicable, to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit the funds so received to the relevant L C Issuer in Dollars. 
 (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans, as applicable, because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L C Issuer an L C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest (which begins to accrue upon funding by the L C Issuer) at the Default Rate for Revolving Credit Loans. In such event, each Appropriate Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
 (iv) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L C Issuer. 
 (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L C Advances to reimburse an L C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided that each Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in 
 76 

Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the relevant L C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) If, at any time after an L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement hereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L C Issuer its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent or the L C Issuer, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. 
 (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following 
 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto 
 (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant L C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction 
 (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit 
 77 

(iv) any payment by the relevant L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any payment made by the relevant L C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
 (v) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Loan Party in respect of such Letter of Credit 
 (vi) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Approved Foreign Currency to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally and 
 (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party 
 provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such L C Issuer s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
 (f) Role of L C Issuers. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Issuance Request. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 2.03(e) provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L C Issuer, and such L C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such L C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L C Issuer s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, 
 78 

each L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 (g) Cash Collateral. If (i) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, (ii) any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02 or (iii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2 00 p.m., New York City time on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), (1) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12 00 noon, New York City time or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (iii), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the L C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). For purposes hereof, Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L C Issuer and the Appropriate Lenders, as collateral for the L C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances Cash Collateral pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Appropriate Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.

Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

 (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 SECTION 2.12 Payments Generally. 
 (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to an Approved Foreign Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office for Dollar-denominated payments and in Same Day Funds not later than 1 00 p.m. New York City time on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder in an Approved Foreign Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent s Office in such Approved Foreign Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than 2 00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9 00 a.m. New York city time) on the dates specified herein. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Approved Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Approved Foreign Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s 
 98 

applicable Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after the time specified above shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
 (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
 (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then 
 (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and 
 (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment (including, without limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan), such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount (including, without limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan) forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 99 

(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV or in the applicable Incremental Amendment, Extension Amendment or Refinancing Amendment are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.04. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender s Pro Rata Share of the sum of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. 
 SECTION 2.13 Sharing of Payments. 
 If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and or such subparticipations in the participations in L C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment 
 100 

obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

 113 

eligibility for the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, and such other documentation as required under the Code, 
 (B) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms), 
 (C) in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (a) a United States Tax Compliance Certificate and (b) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), or

Solely for purposes of this Section 3.01(d)(iii), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date. 
 (e) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01 and Section 3.04(a) shall, if requested by the Borrower, use its reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office (or take any other measures reasonably requested by the Borrower) if such a change or other measures would reduce any such additional amounts (including any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 (f) If any Lender or Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnification or additional amounts paid by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund) provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant 
 114 

taxing authority) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. This section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other person. 
 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender for purposes of this Section 3.01 shall include each L C Issuer and Swing Line Lender.

 SECTION 3.02 Illegality. 
 If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or any other Approved Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies, or, in the case of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all applicable Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans to such day, or promptly, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and all amounts due, if any, in connection with such prepayment or conversion under Section 3.05. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 SECTION 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. 
 (a) If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the applicable Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate for any requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan in a given Approved Currency, or that the Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate for any requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan in such Approved Currency does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that deposits in the applicable Approved Currency in which such proposed Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan is to be denominated are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable amount and the Interest Period, as applicable, of such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan in the applicable Approved Currency, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans in the affected Approved Currency shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in the affected Approved 
 115 

Currency or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request, if applicable, into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein. 
 (b) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period, as applicable, for a Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent reasonably determine in good faith that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate or LIBOR, as applicable, applicable Benchmark Rate for such Interest Period and that (i) such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) such circumstances have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR such Benchmark Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the applicable RFR such Benchmark Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to LIBOR or such RFR Benchmark Rate , as applicable, that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable which shall include a method for determining adjustments to such alternate rate of interest and this Agreement to not increase or decrease pricing in effect for the Interest Period on the Business Day immediately preceding the Business Day on which such alternate rate is selected pursuant to this provision (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Rate). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.01, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date that such amendment is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders of each Class stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

 (b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such demand.

 (c) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a difference currency.

 (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue any Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loan, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.06(b) hereof, such Lender s applicable Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans (or, if such conversion is not possible, repaid) on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurocurrency Benchmark Rate Loans denominated in a LIBO Term Benchmark Currency (or, in the 
 118 

case of an immediate conversion required by Section 3.02, on such earlier date as required by Law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Sections 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist

Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. 
 SECTION 9.05 Notice of Default. 
 The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default.

 Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder.

Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 9.07 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Loan Parties. The undertaking in this Section 9.07 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be. 
 SECTION 9.08 Agents in Their Individual Capacities. 
 Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire Equity Interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Borrower and its respective Affiliates as though Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch were not the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or Swing Line Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to them.

If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent resigns under this Agreement or is removed by the Borrower, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor 
 167 

agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under Sections 8.01(f) or (g) (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, in the case of a resignation, and the Borrower, in the case of a removal may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower (in the case of a resignation), a successor agent from among the Lenders.

If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following the retiring Administrative Agent s or Collateral Agent s notice of resignation or ten (10) days following the Borrower s notice of removal, the retiring Administrative Agent s or the retiring Collateral Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that Section 6.11 is satisfied, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After the retiring Administrative Agent s or Collateral Agent s resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. 
 SECTION 9.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. 
 In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower or the Collateral Agent) shall be (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law) entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise 
 (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09, 10.04 and 10.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding and

 SECTION 9.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. 
 The Lenders irrevocably agree 
 (a) that any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements and Treasury Services Agreements not yet due and payable and (y) contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination or cash collateralization of all Letters of Credit, (ii) at the time the property subject to such Lien is Disposed or to be Disposed as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person other than a Person required to grant a Lien to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents (or, if such transferee is a Person required to grant a Lien to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent on such asset, at the option of the applicable Loan Party, such Lien on such asset may still be released in connection with the transfer so long as (x) the transferee grants a new Lien to the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent on such asset substantially concurrently with the transfer of such asset, (y) the transfer is between parties organized under the laws of different jurisdictions and at least one of such parties is a Foreign Subsidiary and (z) the priority of the new Lien is the same as that of the original Lien), (iii) subject to Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders or (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to clause (c) below 
 (b) To release or subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections 7.01(u) or (w) (in the case of clause (w), to the extent required by the terms of the obligations secured by such Liens) 
 (c) That any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder provided that no such release shall occur if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of the 5 5 8 Senior Notes, Opco Senior Notes or any Junior Financing 
 (d) At the sole option of the Borrower, Parent, Intermediate Parent or any existing entity constituting Holdings shall be released from its obligations under the Guaranty if such entity ceases to be the direct parent of the Borrower as a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant 
 169 

to the definition thereof and otherwise permitted hereunder, subject to the assumption of obligations of Holdings under the Loan Documents by such other Domestic Subsidiary of Parent or Intermediate Parent that directly owns 100 of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the Borrower pursuant to the definition thereof and 
 (e) the Collateral Agent may, without any further consent of any Lender, enter into (i) a First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with the collateral agent or other representatives of holders of Permitted Ratio Debt that is intended to be secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations and or (ii) a Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement with the collateral agent or other representatives of the holders of Indebtedness permitted under Section 7.03, in each case, where such Indebtedness is secured by Liens permitted under Section 7.01. The Collateral Agent may rely exclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower as to whether any such other Liens are permitted. Any First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be binding on the Secured Parties. 
 Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s or the Collateral Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.11. In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent will promptly (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to), at the Borrower s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as the Borrower may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.11. 
 SECTION 9.12 Other Agents Lead Arrangers and Managers.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 
 SECTION 9.13 Withholding Tax Indemnity. 
 To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall, within 10 days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.04 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally 
 170 

imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.13. The agreements in this Section 9.13 shall survive the resignation and or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the term Lender for purposes of this Section 9.13 shall include each L C Issuer and Swing Line Lender. 
 SECTION 9.14 Appointment of Supplemental Agents. 
 (a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a Supplemental Agent and collectively as Supplemental Agents ). 
 (b) In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Collateral Agent and or such Supplemental Agent, as the context may require. 
 Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Agent.
