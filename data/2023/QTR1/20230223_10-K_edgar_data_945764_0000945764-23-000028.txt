GENERAL 
 
 Denbury Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent energy company with operations focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5851 Legacy Circle, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO 2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company s CO 2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO 2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, making the Company s Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions negative today, with a goal to reach Net Zero for our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 CO 2 e emissions within this decade, primarily through increasing the amount of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 used in its operations. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K Form 10-K we use the terms Denbury, Company, we, our and us to refer to Denbury Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries. 
 
 Our CO 2 EOR oil recovery operations result in the associated underground storage of CO 2 . This means that Denbury s activities are supporting and advancing the national energy transition today through the increasing use of industrially sourced CO 2 in EOR operations, as well as building out a dedicated CCUS platform for long-term carbon management for third parties at scale. 
 
 As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles: 
 
 leveraging our extensive CO 2 pipeline assets and CO 2 EOR expertise to expand our operations and leadership position in the emerging CCUS industry; 
 seeking to expand the use of industrial-sourced CO 2 in our tertiary recovery operations, with an ultimate objective of producing oil with a negative carbon footprint; 
 increasing the value of our assets by applying our technical expertise in CO 2 tertiary recovery, together with a combination of other exploration, development, exploitation and marketing skills and practices; 
 managing a disciplined capital allocation process to maximize the rates of return on our investments and organically fund growth while balancing with the return of capital to shareholders when generating free cash; and 
 operating a growing, profitable and sustainable company that is dedicated to bettering our employees, our environment and our communities. 
 
 As further described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - 2020 Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code , Denbury Inc. became the successor reporting company (the Successor of Denbury Resources Inc. (the Predecessor upon the Predecessor s emergence from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020. As part of the plan of reorganization, upon emergence from bankruptcy, all of the Predecessor s previously authorized and/or issued common stock or stock equivalents were cancelled, and new common stock was issued to the Predecessor s debt holders and equity holders upon cancellation of approximately 2.1 billion principal amount of debt and all of the Predecessor s equity instruments. On September 21, 2020, the Successor s new common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DEN, as distinguished from, Denbury Resources Inc. s common stock having been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997.

 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND 2022 DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Since our production is 97 oil, oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Since 2020, oil prices have increased, largely due to increased demand since the height of the COVID-19 coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, plus the effect on energy markets and prices since the Russian attacks on Ukraine, with NYMEX WTI oil prices averaging approximately 94 per barrel in 2022, 68 per barrel in 2021, and 39 per barrel in 2020. The Company s financial results improved from 2021 to 2022 due to higher oil prices, although the positive oil price impact was offset in part by the commodity hedges we were obligated to put in place through mid-2022 under the one-time requirement of our bank credit facility shortly after we emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020. Our financial results in 2022 were further impacted by inflationary pressures, primarily increasing our power costs, service costs and labor costs, caused in part by worldwide and U.S. supply chain issues. During 2022, we utilized our cash flow to primarily fund our oil and gas development and to secure CO 2 storage capacity for future CCUS activities, and with the excess cash flow resulting from higher oil prices, we returned capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program. 
 
 The following include some of our key 2022 business developments: 
 
 Continued development of our Cedar Creek Anticline CCA EOR project in Montana and North Dakota, a carbon-negative CO 2 EOR project, with CO 2 injection commencing in early 2022 and initial production response anticipated in the second half of 2023. 
 Progressed the expansion of CO 2 EOR developments at several fields, including Beaver Creek, Soso, Heidelberg and Cranfield. 
 Utilized excess cash flow to repurchase 1.6 million shares of Denbury common stock for approximately 100 million at an average price of 61.92 per share, leaving 250 million remaining authorized for future repurchases under our share repurchase program. 
 Amended the Company s senior secured bank credit facility, increasing the borrowing base and lender commitments to 750 million, extending the maturity to 2027, and relaxing various covenants. 
 Executed six agreements with customers for the potential future transportation and/or storage of industrial-sourced CO 2 covering approximately 18 Mmtpa, raising our cumulative total of CO 2 covered under future transportation/storage agreements to approximately 20 Mmtpa. 
 Expanded our dedicated CO 2 storage portfolio to a total of seven contracted sites with estimated storage potential of approximately 2 billion metric tons, with planned sites in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. 
 Invested 10 million in the project development company of a planned blue hydrogen/ammonia facility. 
 Submitted our first Class VI well permits for injecting CO 2 into permanent geologic storage. 
 
 CARBON CAPTURE, UTILIZATION AND STORAGE 
 
 CCUS is a process that captures CO 2 from industrial sources and either reuses or stores the CO 2 in geologic formations in order to prevent its release into the atmosphere. We utilize CO 2 from industrial sources in our EOR operations, and our extensive CO 2 pipeline infrastructure and operations, particularly in the Gulf Coast, are strategically located in close proximity to both large sources of industrial emissions and geological formations well-suited for permanent storage. In the Rocky Mountain region, all of the CO 2 we utilize in our EOR operations is from industrial sources and is transported through our extensive CO 2 pipeline system. While industrial CO 2 emissions in the Rocky Mountain region are not as significant as in the Gulf Coast, we believe the Rocky Mountain region also holds great potential for CCUS. We believe that the assets and technical expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with our existing CO 2 EOR operations. For more than 20 years, Denbury has been transporting and utilizing CO 2 in association with its EOR operations, and the cumulative associated storage of CO 2 underground through its EOR operations totals more than 240 million metric tons to date. 
 
 Supportive U.S. government policy and public pressure on industrial CO 2 emitters provide strong incentives for them to capture their CO 2 emissions; for example, in January 2021, the IRS issued final regulations under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q on the expanded carbon capture tax credit, implementing a number of changes and clarifications to previous regulations which provided a tax incentive of 35 per ton for CO 2 used in enhanced oil recovery and 50 per ton for CO 2 permanently sequestered in geologic formations outside of EOR. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was passed and increased the value of the tax credits from 50 per ton of sequestered CO 2 to 85 per ton (subject to certain

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 qualifications and adjustments), and from 35 per ton of CO 2 used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to 60 per ton (subject to certain qualifications and adjustments). The tax credit is available on volumes of permanently sequestered CO 2 to the owner of the capture facilities for a 12-year period for qualifying facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2033. In addition to the Section 45Q tax credits, some entities may be eligible for other financial incentives or benefits for products that are created through CCUS. 
 
 We believe the incentives offered under Section 45Q will drive demand for CCUS and will allow us to collect a fee for the transportation and storage of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 , and further expand its utilization in our EOR operations. While a portion of the CO 2 we currently utilize in our EOR operations is captured from industrial sources and qualifies as CCUS, we have historically paid a fee for that CO 2 as those arrangements were entered into many years ago. As the enhanced Section 45Q regulations are relatively new, it will likely take several years for new capture facilities to be built and for dedicated storage sites to be developed. 
 
 As we seek to grow our CCUS business and pursue new CCUS opportunities, we have focused on the following strategic priorities: 
 
 securing transportation and storage agreements with industrial emitters; 
 adding safe, reliable, uninterruptible and secure permanent storage capacity through development of a diverse portfolio of subsurface storage sites; 
 increasing our carbon-negative oil production by seeking to replace the use of naturally-sourced CO 2 in our EOR operations; 
 preparing for a capital efficient expansion of our Green Pipeline capacity to meet expected rapid growth in demand from Gulf Coast industrial facility owners; and 
 pursuing strategic partnerships throughout the CCUS value chain. 
 
 Transportation and Storage 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had agreements with eight customers for the future transportation and/or storage of CO 2 from industrial sources covering 20 Mmtpa, 18 Mmtpa of which was added during 2022. Our largest agreement is with a planned clean hydrogen-ammonia complex called Ascension Clean Energy ACE ). During 2022, we invested 10 million in the project development company of ACE, (Clean Hydrogen Works), while also signing a definitive agreement for the transportation and storage of CO 2 for the first two blocks of the proposed plant. We have committed to investing another 10 million when certain milestones are achieved, which is expected in 2023. The planned clean hydrogen-ammonia complex is targeting a final investment decision in 2024 and is expected to include two ammonia blocks with estimated CO 2 capture of up to 12 Mmtpa, with ammonia production from the first block expected to commence in 2027. Our agreements today are largely supported by planned ammonia/hydrogen plants, but also include plants proposing to produce biofuels, low carbon fuels, and methanol. Our agreements are with customers ranging from large international companies, such as Nutrien and Mitsubishi, to companies that are in the project development stage. We are working with many additional companies and projects on proposed future capture projects and expect to continue to add to our future business opportunities during 2023. We currently expect initial transportation and/or storage volumes associated with CCUS in 2025. 
 
 Storage Sites 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had seven planned storage sites under contract with estimated potential permanent storage of approximately 2 billion metric tons. The Company s storage portfolio spans the U.S. Gulf Coast, including planned sequestration sites in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Most of these sites are located in close proximity to our Gulf Coast CO 2 pipeline system. We are progressing development at these sites and submitted our first Class VI well permits for injecting CO 2 into permanent geologic storage in late 2022. We anticipate additional submittals during 2023, expect to drill test wells in 2023, and estimate first injection to begin in 2025. We are also evaluating potential CO 2 storage sites in the Rocky Mountain region in close proximity to our extensive CO 2 pipeline system. 
 
 OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS 
 
 Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. Approximately 97

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 of our production is oil, and over two-thirds of our production is from CO 2 EOR. Over time, we have grown primarily through the acquisition of mature oil fields, where we focus on increasing the value of those properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction processes, with our most significant emphasis relating to CO 2 EOR operations. Our current portfolio of CO 2 EOR projects provides us with significant oil production and reserve growth potential, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects. 
 
 We own and operate more than 1,300 miles of CO 2 transportation pipelines. Our extensive CO 2 pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions gives us the ability to deliver CO 2 from our natural and industrial CO 2 sources for use in our CO 2 EOR fields, as well as to deliver CO 2 to our customers who are industrial end-users of CO 2 or EOR customers. In the future, we plan to utilize these same pipelines for the transportation and storage of CO 2 in our emerging CCUS business. Our Green Pipeline currently has ample capacity to handle additional volumes, and we can further expand capacity by adding pump stations or looping sections of the pipeline. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates 
 
 DeGolyer and MacNaughton D M prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (see the summary of D M s report as of December 31, 2022 included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in each year in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC. These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. 
 
 The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D M as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. The Company s December 31, 2022 proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and PV-10 Values increased from December 31, 2021 due largely to the increase in oil prices used in preparing the December 31, 2021 and 2022 reserve information. The average NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves increased from 66.56 per Bbl at December 31, 2021, to 93.67 per Bbl at December 31, 2022. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control, which are further discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.

 (3) PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis. Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold, to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties, and to perform our impairment testing of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See also Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of PV-10 Value and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure. 
 
 Our proved developed non-producing reserves primarily consist of (1) reserves within a proved tertiary flood in areas that have not yet experienced a response from CO 2 injection, (2) reserves that will be recovered from currently productive zones utilizing minor modifications to manage the flow of CO 2 or water within the reservoir, and (3) reserves that will be recovered through recompletions to other intervals above or below the currently producing interval. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 3.9 MMBOE, or approximately 2 of our estimated total proved reserves. Our proved undeveloped reserves were 5.9 MMBOE (60 lower than at December 31, 2021. During 2022, we spent approximately 53.2 million to convert 5.3 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to non-tertiary development activities at Heidelberg and Beaver Creek. During 2022, we added an additional 1.1 MMBOE of estimated proved undeveloped reserves primarily related to tertiary operations at Hastings and Beaver Creek fields, and recognized net downward revisions of our proved undeveloped reserves of 1.7 MMBOE. 
 
 During 2022, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2021 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Enhanced Oil Recovery. EOR using CO 2 is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil. When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO 2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold. The terms tertiary flood, CO 2 flood and CO 2 EOR are used interchangeably throughout this document. 
 
 While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO 2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO 2 EOR projects we operate. 
 
 We began our CO 2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO 2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001. Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO 2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO 2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO 2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production. Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO 2 or plan to flood with CO 2 in the future, or assets that produce CO 2 . During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 40 of the CO 2 utilized in our operated oil and gas operations was industrial-sourced CO 2 and approximately 28 of our production for 2022 was carbon-negative, meaning the total amount of industrial-sourced CO 2 injected more than offset Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO 2 e emissions (see Climate Change and Environmental Considerations below). 
 
 Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including: 
 
 a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data; 
 lower production decline rates than unconventional development; 
 reasonable return metrics at currently anticipated long-term prices; 
 limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO 2 reserves and CO 2 pipeline infrastructure; 
 being generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields; and 
 allowing us to concurrently store CO 2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas. 
 
 Our tertiary operations represent 68 of our 2022 total production (on a BOE basis). At year-end 2022, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately 2.9 billion, or 64 of our total PV-10 Value, and represented 60 of our total proved reserves. In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned. 
 
 Gulf Coast Region Assets 
 
 Gulf Coast Oil Fields 
 
 Our CO 2 EOR operations began in August 1999 with the acquisition of Little Creek Field, which is our longest-producing CO 2 EOR flood. Our most mature CO 2 EOR properties are generally located along our NEJD CO 2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi. These properties include Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Little Creek, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields, which have been producing under CO 2 EOR for some time, and their production is generally declining. We commenced tertiary floods at both Tinsley and Heidelberg fields in Mississippi during 2008, and at Delhi Field in Louisiana in 2009. Many of our Mississippi fields contain multiple reservoirs 
 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 that are amenable to CO 2 EOR. Accordingly, we often find opportunities to expand the floods to new development areas over many years or even decades. 
 
 We further expanded tertiary operations to Texas with the acquisitions of interests in Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Oyster Bayou is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay and Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas. Concurrent with the completion of the Green Pipeline in 2010, we initiated tertiary floods at these fields in 2010. We began producing oil from our tertiary operations at Oyster Bayou Field in 2011 and Hastings Field in 2012. Incremental development efforts continue at both fields today. These fields accounted for 35 of our Gulf Coast tertiary production in 2022. 
 
 In addition to our tertiary operations in the Gulf Coast region, we currently own interests in several properties that are currently not under CO 2 flood, the most significant of which are Conroe, Thompson and Webster fields in Texas. We continue to evaluate the potential to progress CO 2 EOR development in these fields, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities, future oil prices and in some cases pipeline construction. 
 
 CO 2 Sources 
 
 Natural CO 2 Sources 
 
 Our primary Gulf Coast CO 2 source, Jackson Dome, is a large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO 2 (98 CO 2 and, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO 2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Jackson Dome provides us a significant competitive advantage in the acquisition and development of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO 2 EOR. We have drilled numerous CO 2 -producing wells in Jackson Dome over the years. As of December 31, 2022, we have estimated proved CO 2 reserves in Jackson Dome of 3.8 Tcf. The proved CO 2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 3.0 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO 2 reserves prepared by D M, independent petroleum engineers. In discussing our available CO 2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for our customers who are industrial end-users of CO 2 or EOR customers, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO 2 production stream. 
 
 In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 1.4 Tcf, on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of probable CO 2 reserves at Jackson Dome. While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO 2 is present. 
 
 Industrial-sourced CO 2 
 
 In addition to our naturally occurring CO 2 source at Jackson Dome, in our tertiary operations we utilize CO 2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Industrial sources of CO 2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce CO 2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO 2 which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations (see Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage above). In the Gulf Coast, we are currently party to two long-term contracts to purchase CO 2 : an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas and an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana, which combined supplied an average of approximately 55 MMcf/d of CO 2 to our EOR operations during 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 14 of the CO 2 utilized in our Gulf Coast EOR operations was industrial-sourced CO 2 . 
 
 In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 76 of our average daily CO 2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2022 was used in our operated tertiary recovery operations, compared to 76 in 2021 and 77 in 2020, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial end-users or EOR customers. During 2022, we used an average of 400 MMcf/d of CO 2 (including CO 2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.

 CO 2 Pipelines 
 
 We own nearly 925 miles of CO 2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast region, which gives us the ability to deliver CO 2 throughout the region. At the present time, most of the CO 2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO 2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are currently transporting a third party s CO 2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field. We currently have ample capacity within the Green Pipeline to handle additional volumes that may be required to develop our inventory of CO 2 EOR projects in this area, as well as to support the transportation of CO 2 for the emerging CCUS business. The following table summarizes our most significant CO 2 pipelines owned and operated in the Gulf Coast region as of December 31, 2022:

 Rocky Mountain Region Assets 
 
 Rocky Mountain Oil Fields 
 
 We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 with the acquisition of Encore Acquisition Company. Bell Creek Field was the first CO 2 EOR flood we developed in this region which began tertiary production in 2013. We have added several properties to our portfolio in the Rocky Mountain region over time, including Grieve Field in 2011, Hartzog Draw Field in 2012, and the acquisition of additional interests at CCA in 2013. In March 2021, we acquired a nearly 100 working interest (83 net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek EOR fields in Wyoming, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO 2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields. 
 
 CCA is the largest property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 21 of our 2022 total sales volumes. Historical production from the property has primarily been from the Red River interval. CCA is primarily located in Montana but extends over such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota. CCA is a series of 13 different operating areas on a common geological trend, each of which could be considered a field by itself. 
 
 In early-February 2022, we commenced CO 2 injection in the first phase of our CCA EOR project, and currently expect tertiary oil production response from CCA in the second half of 2023. In addition, drilling and facility construction at the Company s Pennel CO 2 pilot, in advance of Phase 2 development of CCA, commenced during the third quarter of 2022. In addition to these oil fields, we continue to evaluate tertiary potential in Hartzog Draw Field located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, the development of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices. The field is located approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline. 
 
 CO 2 Sources 
 
 All CO 2 used in our Rocky Mountain tertiary operations is captured from industrial sources. We own an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil s CO 2 reserves in LaBarge Field. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming, and as of December 31, 2022, our interest in LaBarge Field held approximately 1.0 Tcf of proved CO 2 reserves. During 2022, we received an average of approximately 151 MMcf/d of CO 2 from the Shute Creek

 Denbury Inc. 

 gas processing plant at LaBarge Field that we used in our Rocky Mountain region CO 2 floods or sold to another third-party operator. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO 2 , we currently expect our CO 2 volumes from Shute Creek to increase in future years. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO 2 , which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO 2 floods. 
 
 We also have a contract in place to receive all of the CO 2 from the Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, which we estimate has the capability to provide us as much as 30 MMcf/d of CO 2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO 2 floods. We received 24 MMcf/d of CO 2 volumes from this source in 2022. We currently estimate that our existing CO 2 sources, plus additional CO 2 from those or other CO 2 sources in the region, are sufficient to carry out our Rocky Mountain region EOR development plans. 
 
 CO 2 Pipelines 
 
 The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO 2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region. The 232-mile pipeline begins at the Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana. In 2021, we completed construction of the CCA CO 2 pipeline, which delivers CO 2 to our new tertiary development project at CCA. The following table summarizes our most significant CO 2 pipelines owned and operated in the Rocky Mountain region as of December 31, 2022:

Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 
 
 (2) A productive well is an exploratory or development well drilled and completed during the year and found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well. 
 
 (3) A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well. 
 
 (4) Includes 8 productive gross wells and 1 non-productive gross well during 2021, and 2 productive gross wells during 2020, in which we incurred no cost but have an overriding royalty interest prior to the combined payout of the wells. Subsequent to payout, Denbury will hold and bear the cost of its working interest in each well. 
 
 (5) During 2022, an additional 7 wells were drilled for water or CO 2 injection purposes. There were no wells drilled during 2021 or 2020 for water or CO 2 injection purposes

 TITLE TO PROPERTIES 
 
 As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING 
 
 Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two purchasers each accounted for 10 or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (27 and Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (11 ). 
 
 Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, available oil storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, and other inventory hubs, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation. While we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices. 
 
 Oil Marketing and Differentials 
 
 Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. Our crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region have historically been highly correlated to the changes in prices of crude oil sold under the Light Louisiana Sweet LLS index. Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand. 
 
 The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to our primary market centers in Guernsey and Casper, Wyoming, although some of our production may ultimately be transported by third parties to Cushing, Oklahoma and Wood River, Illinois. Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment. We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future. Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets. 
 
 COMPETITION AND MARKETS 
 
 We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO 2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor. Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments. Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO 2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Climate change, which is a specifically identified part of our broader efforts to operate in a manner consonant with ESG standards and goals, is a continuing global concern for governments, businesses, and society. The reduction of GHG emissions is important, and we take the responsibility of protecting our environment seriously. Part of our obligation is to report GHG emissions and develop procedures and methods to collect data critical for calculating these emissions. In addition, our operating strategy, which focuses on CO 2 EOR and CCUS, has measurable environmental benefits. We are committed to utilizing emerging technologies, where feasible, to capture or reduce emissions and to lower our GHG intensity. 
 
 We strive to be environmentally responsible in all aspects of our operations. Our operations have been subject to federal, state and local environmental compliance for many years, the costs of which are well integrated into our budgeting and our operating results. With our focus on CO 2 EOR, we offer environmental benefits not generally associated with oil and gas operations. We utilize technology and techniques that reduce the risks to, and impacts on, the environment. Our programs include measures to prevent spills and releases and to quickly respond to incidents if they do occur; efforts to manage, minimize and remediate our environmental impacts; and an operating strategy that is directly focused on our carbon footprint. 
 
 As the world demands energy to fuel tomorrow s economy and provide a better quality of life, we must meet the demand with a focus on reducing GHG emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Greenhouse Gas Protocol classifies a company s GHG emissions into three scopes: Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy; and Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. The utilization of industrial-sourced CO 2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of our oil production, making our Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions negative today. We have set a target, within this decade, to reach Net Zero for our Scope 1, Scope 2 and those Scope 3 emissions that result from a consumer s use of the oil and natural gas we sell (defined as Category 11 emissions by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol). 
 
 In our Corporate Responsibility Report, which is published on our website, we report in detail our direct GHG emissions resulting from our operations, as well as indirect GHG emissions associated with the consumption of electricity. 
 
 In addition, we are committed to engaging with stakeholders, policy makers, regulators, and our industry on climate change and ESG issues and to addressing our impact on the environment. The Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our overall ESG strategy including health and safety, climate change, environmental, social and community policies, practices and procedures. The Committee focuses upon climate change risk management and strategy, CCUS activities, sustainability targets, and operating efficiencies, along with broader climate change concerns. 

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our employees are Denbury s greatest resource, and each individual helps shape Denbury into a unique and exceptional place to work. Our employees ideas, passion and collective efforts are what produce winning results for our Company. We support a talented and diverse workforce that lives our key values and embodies our culture. We inspire each other to make Denbury better. As of December 31, 2022, we had 765 employees, of whom 414 were employed in our field operations or at our field offices and 351 were employed at our headquarters in Plano, TX, none of whom are currently covered by a labor union or other collective bargaining arrangement. 
 
 Workforce Health and Safety 
 
 Emphasizing workforce health and safety is not only a critical element of our ESG strategy, but it has also been a central part of our practices and standards over the years. We continuously seek to improve our health and safety performance by fostering a culture that prioritizes safe work, then ensuring that this culture is exemplified in all levels of leadership. We provide our employees with tools to succeed, including relevant and timely training, and we monitor our performance using established measurement statistics. With oversight from the Sustainability and Governance Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, each year, Denbury establishes corporate goals specifically related to employee and contractor safety performance and monitors progress toward those goals throughout the year using performance metrics. Results are regularly reported to our Board of Directors, senior management and all employees to ensure accountability and to reinforce their

 importance. Two safety performance metrics Denbury closely monitors are the Total Recordable Incident Rate TRIR and the Significant Injury or Fatality Rate SIFR ), which also captures near misses that may not have resulted in an injury. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain outstanding talent. In addition to competitive base wages, other benefit programs include an annual bonus plan, an employee stock purchase plan, a long-term incentive plan, Company matched 401(k) plan, competitive healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts and employee assistance programs. 
 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
 At Denbury, we strive to make diversity, equity and inclusion a part of our culture. Our management is responsible for implementing our diversity initiatives, including targeted recruitment of underrepresented populations, diversity training, and development of our diverse workforce. The Sustainability and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides our management with oversight and advice with respect to our practices, strategies and initiatives related to human capital management, such as diversity, equity and inclusion matters, workplace culture and talent development. We recognize the benefits we all share as a result of a diverse culture and are continually looking for ways to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment. In 2022, women and minorities accounted for 21 and 17 of our workforce, respectively, 25 and 32 of our new hires, respectively, and 25 and 13 of our Board of Directors, respectively. 
 
 Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. To foster a diverse and collaborative workplace, Denbury requires all employees to complete annual training to raise awareness and encourage diversity and inclusion. Each year, our employee training program includes courses related to diversity, anti-discrimination, and anti-harassment to help employees better appreciate diversity, cultural differences, recognize unconscious biases, and increase collaboration. For 2022, our training completion rate was 96 . We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our Board of Directors and executive leadership team. 
 
 Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development 
 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to hire, develop, and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel, including our executive officers as well as other key management and technical specialists, such as geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other oil and gas industry professionals. Denbury provides employees with many ways to expand their skills and advance their careers through training and development initiatives. We believe this is critical to each employee s professional growth and success, as well as to our success as a company. 
 
 Denbury aims to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment. We broaden our pool of diverse candidates by utilizing a digital recruiting program which posts available employment opportunities to websites worldwide, some of which are dedicated to diverse candidate pools, as well as by recruiting at local career workshops, several of which are specifically targeted at diverse candidates, veterans and other underrepresented groups. 
 
 Denbury believes that recruitment and advancement is based on qualification and performance. Our Company provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy status, sexual orientation or gender identity), national origin, disability, age, veterans status, marital status, genetic information (including family medical history) or any other category protected by applicable law. Denbury makes employment-related decisions, including with respect to hiring, job assignment, promotion, remuneration, training and benefits, without regard to any legally protected status. Denbury s objective is to provide a work environment that fosters mutual respect and working relationships free from discrimination, harassment or retaliation. Our management is charged with creating an atmosphere free from such conduct, and employees are responsible for respecting the rights of their co-workers. 
 
 Each year, Denbury employees have the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience, the company s culture, and improvement ideas through an annual survey. The completion rate on the 2022 annual survey was approximately 82 . Denbury values this feedback and the results are used to support continuous improvement. In 2022, Denbury had a total turnover rate of approximately 6.6 .

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS 
 
 Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry. Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape can be challenging, and noncompliance can result in substantial penalties or the potential shutdown of operations. Compliance has also been complicated by an increasing trend for litigation challenging policy and regulatory changes, with judicial decisions increasing regulatory uncertainty, often delaying necessary approvals from agencies that may be the subject of conflicting injunctions, rulings or appeals. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated. 
 
 The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us. We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives. 
 
 Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production 
 
 Our operations are subject to various types of laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring sometimes lengthy environmental review prior to approval of potential leasing, drilling, or other development projects; permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the compensation due to surface, and potentially pore space, owners for mineral development, enhanced oil recovery, and fluid disposal activities; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations. Our operations are also subject to various environmental and conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, federal and state environmental and 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these laws and regulations may delay proposed development projects, limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability. 
 
 Federal Energy Pipeline and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation 
 
 The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the PHMSA authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO 2 pipelines. In mid-2022, PHMSA announced its intention to initiate a new rulemaking to update standards for CO 2 pipelines, including requirements related to emergency preparedness and response, which new rulemaking had not occurred as of February 2023. 
 
 Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed and enacted new regulations and policies to limit the emission of pollutants, including GHG emissions, as part of climate change initiatives and the Clean Air Act. During the last ten years, both the EPA and Bureau of Land Management BLM have proposed and issued such regulations and policies for the oil and gas industry. Those proposed and final regulations and policies were the subject of extensive administrative, judicial, and Congressional consideration during the Obama and Trump Administrations, which caused significant difficulty in determining which regulations were in force at any given time. The Biden Administration, through various executive orders and other policy statements, has made climate change a primary priority. On January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 13990, directing agencies to review all agency actions related to emissions and climate change taken under the Trump Administration. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint Congressional resolution disapproving the EPA s 2020 policy rules related to GHG emissions from oil and gas industry activities under the Clean Air Act. On November 2, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations for GHG emissions. In November 2022, the EPA proposed to update, strengthen and expand its November 2021 proposed regulations to include more comprehensive emission reductions from oil and gas facilities. Public hearings on the new proposed regulations were held in January 2023, with a potential final rule to be published thereafter. In November 2022, BLM proposed new rules regulating the venting, flaring and leaks of natural gas during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands. The comment period for the new proposed rules ended January 30, 2023. While BLM s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. Any resulting regulations adopted by the EPA or BLM could possibly be similar to, or even more stringent than, those promulgated by the agencies under the Obama Administration. Enforcement of such regulations may impose additional costs related to compliance with these new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. 
 
 CCUS Regulation 
 
 The Biden Administration has previously announced a domestic climate goal of net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, and committed to supporting the responsible development and deployment of CCUS technologies to make it a widely available, increasingly cost-effective, and rapidly scalable climate solution across all industrial sectors. 
 
 On February 16, 2022, pursuant to the Utilizing Significant Emissions with Innovative Technologies Act, the White House s Council on Environmental Quality CEQ issued guidance for Federal agencies on the facilitation of reviews associated with the deployment of CCUS projects and carbon dioxide pipelines, and to support the efficient, orderly, and responsible deployment of CCUS projects and carbon dioxide pipelines, where appropriate. This guidance was consistent with the CEQ s report, Council on Environmental Quality Report to Congress on Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration issued in June 2021, which identified numerous permits and/or reviews that may be required during the development of a CCUS project, some examples of which are: 
 
 Clean Air Act New Source Review preconstruction permit; 
 Clean Air Act Title V operating permit; 
 Underground Injection Control UIC permit; 
 Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement under National Environmental Policy Act; 
 Consultations with Fish and Wildlife Service pursuant to Endangered Species Act; 
 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 Compliance with Mineral Leasing Act for geologic sequestration; and 
 Compliance with PHMSA standards and regulations. 
 
 On July 27, 2022, the CEQ also established a task force to provide recommendations to the Federal government on how to ensure CCUS projects, such as carbon dioxide pipelines, are permitted in an efficient manner. The final recommendations of the CEQ on permitting, and any resultant regulatory schemes established by the Biden Administration and/or Congress, may impose additional costs related to compliance. 
 
 The Environmental Protection Agency EPA has a regulatory framework under the authorities of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act that regulates UIC programs and ensures the long-term, safe geologic sequestration of CO 2 . The EPA also provides guidance to support state program implementation of UIC programs. This includes minimum requirements for state UIC programs and permitting for injection wells. These requirements include performance standards for well construction, operation and maintenance, monitoring and testing, reporting and recordkeeping, site closure, financial responsibility, and post injection site care. The EPA has issued regulations for six classes of underground injection wells based on type and depth of fluids injected and potential for endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used to inject fluids relating to oil and gas operations, including with respect to the injection of CO 2 for EOR, while Class VI wells are used for the express purpose of injecting CO 2 for geologic storage. 
 
 Our carbon transportation and storage operations are also subject to state regulations. Numerous state legislatures have passed legislation specifically pertaining to carbon storage projects and addressing issues such as: (1) pre-requisites for obtaining a permit to drill and/or establish a carbon storage facility; (2) pore space ownership, (3) mineral rights primacy, (4) carbon dioxide ownership, and (5) long-term liability associated with carbon storage facilities. In 2022, numerous states passed new laws addressing one or more of these issues, including Mississippi and Wyoming. Management believes that we are currently in compliance with all state regulations pertaining to the development and/or operation of carbon transportation and storage projects. However, the regulatory environment around CCUS projects is in a state of rapid evolution and we anticipate that further state regulations applicable to our operations may be passed in the coming years, including within Texas and/or Louisiana. 
 
 Federal, State or Indian Leases 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 30 of our net developed acreage and 27 of our December 2022 production related to oil and natural gas operations performed on federal acreage, including portions of CCA. Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies. 
 
 New federal oil and gas leasing has resumed, although at a slower pace, after various executive orders, secretarial orders, and related litigation caused significant delay in 2021 and 2022. Recent federal oil and gas leasing and permitting decisions, however, remain subject to pending litigation in several federal courts throughout the country, and consequently the current litigation environment implies that nearly all new federal leasing and permitting decisions are likely to be subject to judicial challenge. 
 
 BLM has also announced plans to introduce a new proposed rule to update its oil and gas leasing process. The proposed rule may include increases to the fees, rents, royalty rates, bonding requirements, and updated procedures for ensuring environmental stewardship and climate change analysis for new federal oil and gas leases. While BLM s proposal is listed on its regulatory agenda and has been the subject of scoping meetings, the agency has not yet issued a proposed rule. If such a rule is finalized, any increase in the fees related to oil and gas development on federal lands will increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability. 
 
 Environmental Regulations 
 
 Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO 2 , and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials NORM are subject to stringent regulation. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under 
 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures. 
 
 Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including GHG emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO 2 ; (4) the Clean Water Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on wastewater discharges from our operations; (5) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (6) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (7) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; (8) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, which protects certain bird species, including certain species that could be present on our leases, from intentional and unintentional killing and other disturbances; and (9) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes. 
 
 In the Rocky Mountain region, federal agencies actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans, oil and gas lease sales, and project-level master development plans. On April 20, 2022 the Council on Environmental Quality issued a final rule that updates National Environmental Policy Act regulations to remove consideration of the applicant s goals, to allow agencies greater flexibility in developing applicable review procedures, and to revise the definition of effects to be considered to include direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. With implementation of the new rule, the federal environmental review process is expected to continue or even increase delay in federal decision making related to oil and gas development. 
 
 Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The risks described below fall into five broad categories related to (1) oil price volatility and demand, (2) future executive, legislative or regulatory actions, (3) financial risks, (4) significant CCUS activities, (5) cybersecurity risks, and (6) those related to our operations and industry. These are not the only risks we face but are considered to be the most material. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 
 Risks Relating to Volatility in Oil Pricing and Demand for Oil 
 
 Oil prices have been very volatile in recent years, which is expected to continue or increase, which may lead to significant periods of reduced cash flows and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Oil prices are currently the most important determinant of our operational and financial success. Oil prices are highly impacted by worldwide oil supply, demand and prices and have historically been subject to significant price changes over short periods of time. Over the last several years, NYMEX oil prices have been extremely volatile, reaching a three-year peak over 123 per Bbl in March 2022 compared to lows averaging 17 per Bbl in April 2020. The year-to-year volatility has been due to the reduction in worldwide economic activity and oil demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and in 2022 energy prices increased due to the Russian attacks on Ukraine, OPEC supply pressures and increasing oil demand. During 2022, prices ranged from a high of 123.70 in March and a low of 71.02 in December. 
 
 Oil price volatility will remain. Although global petroleum demand is currently rising faster than petroleum supply, driving higher prices during 2022, factors beyond our control could cause prices to move downward on a rapid or repeated basis, making planning and budgeting, acquisition transactions, capital raising, and sustaining business strategies more difficult. Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil, as oil comprised approximately 97 of our 2022 average daily sales volumes and approximately 98 of our proved reserves at December 31, 2022. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: 
 
 the level of worldwide demand for oil and natural gas; 
 worldwide economic conditions; 
 the degree to which members of OPEC maintain oil price and production controls; 
 the degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production affects worldwide supply of crude oil or its price; 
 worldwide political events, conditions and policies, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations. 
 
 Negative movements in oil prices could harm us in a number of ways, including: 
 
 lower cash flows from operations may require reduced levels of capital expenditures; which in turn could lower our present and future production levels and lower the quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which constitute our major asset; 
 we could be forced to increase our level of indebtedness, issue additional equity, or sell assets; and/or 
 we could be required to impair various assets, including a write-down of our oil and natural gas assets or the value of other tangible or intangible assets. 
 
 Furthermore, some or all of our tertiary projects could become or remain uneconomical. We may also decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our operating cash break-even points for an extended period of time, we may decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and reduce our production. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and will likely continue to affect worldwide economic activity, which could negatively affect demand for oil. 
 
 The continuing effect of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a global slowdown in economic activity, disrupting supply chains, and reducing global workforces, increasing market volatility and directly impacting domestic and global oil demand, and consequently, our operational and financial performance. It is impossible to predict the ultimate degree to which future

 variants of COVID-19 and their spread could lead to continuing significant and material disruptions in economic activity, and oil prices, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Geopolitical tensions, principally the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have caused and may heighten oil market volatility that could negatively affect our results of operations. 
 
 The war in Ukraine, and trade and monetary sanctions in response to the Russian invasion, could continue to significantly affect worldwide oil prices and demand, feed inflation, and cause turmoil in the global financial system and oil markets, which are the primary determinants of our results of operations. This could lead to continuing significant and material disruptions in economic activity, and oil prices, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Risks Relating to Any Future Executive, Legislative or Regulatory Actions 
 
 Any future climate change initiatives by the Biden Administration, by Congress or by state regulatory or legislative bodies could negatively affect our business and operations. 
 
 In early 2021, the Biden Administration recommitted the United States to the Paris Climate Agreement and targeted a reduction of 50-52 GHG emissions by the year 2030. In order to achieve such goal, in 2021, the Biden Administration introduced initiatives, which include policies to address climate change, energy efficiency, and clean energy. If the Biden Administration and Congress adopt stricter standards for, and increase oversight and regulation over, the exploration and production industry at the federal level, these measures could lead to increased costs or additional operating restrictions. Also, there is the potential for climate change legislation which could affect demand for oil on a long-term basis. 
 
 Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and natural gas leases in the Rocky Mountain region, conducted pursuant to permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies, may be impacted by the risks outlined above (See Federal and State Regulations Federal, State or Indian Leases ). 
 
 A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various proposals to combat climate change and how it should be dealt with, including heightened CO 2 pipeline regulation. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change or CO 2 pipeline standards or procedures could impose significant costs on us and possibly affect our financial condition and operating performance. 
 
 Environmental laws and regulations applicable to our industry are costly and stringent. 
 
 Our exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the protection of endangered species. These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. 
 
 Financial Risks 
 
 Commodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss. 
 
 To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. As of February 22, 2023, we have oil derivative contracts in place covering approximately 27,000 Bbls/d for the first half of 2023, 23,000 Bbls/d for the second half of 2023, 2,000 Bbls/d for the first half of 2024, and 1,000 Bbls/d for the second half of 2024. Such derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, when the cash benefit from hedges including a sold put is limited to the extent oil 
 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 prices fall below the price of any sold puts in our derivative portfolio, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract is financially constrained and defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. 
 
 Continuing or worsening inflationary or supply chain issues could lower our margins and operational efficiency. 
 
 We anticipate inflationary pressures to continue into 2023 and have included these adjustments in our 2023 budget. Expectations of lingering or increasing inflationary pressures in our industry are becoming widespread (including anticipated double digit percentage price increases in certain expense categories). In addition to price increases by third-party service companies, it may become more costly for us to recruit and retain key employees, particularly specialized/technical personnel, in the face of increased competition for specialized and experienced oilfield workers. 
 
 Government and societal reaction to climate change could impact our stock price and increase our costs, while pressure to meet ESG standards may impact our business. 
 
 Increasing attention to climate change and public and investor demands that companies address climate change and ESG standards may increase our costs, reduce demand for oil or negatively impact our stock price and access to capital markets. Furthermore, organizations that advise many institutional investors on corporate governance and investment and voting decisions have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies related to ESG matters. Negative ratings by these organizations, together with ESG advocates pressure for investors to divest fossil fuel equities and for lenders to limit funding to oil and gas producers, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward the oil and gas industry, including the Company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. Denbury s movement into CCUS along with a focus upon climate change risk management and strategy, sustainability targets, and operating efficiencies, may mitigate some of these risks. 
 
 Tax proposals under discussion within the Biden Administration, if enacted, could change or remove long-time tax benefits available to the oil and gas industry for drilling and production activities. 
 
 As part of its fiscal year 2023 budgetary planning, the Biden Administration discussed a number of changes to certain provisions of federal tax law applicable to the exploration and production industry, including imposing a tax on carbon emissions, as well as eliminating long-standing deductions that benefit the fossil fuel industry. Among the specific provisions focused upon were Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 263, which allows expensing of exploration, development and intangible drilling costs, and IRC Section 613, which allows use of percentage depletion instead of cost depletion to recover drilling and development costs of oil and gas wells. Any such changes would require the U.S. Congress to pass new legislation and are likely to be part of a broader set of tax revisions. 
 
 Open-market sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock acquired upon exercise by holders of our outstanding warrants, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. 
 
 In connection with our plan of reorganization, we issued series A and series B warrants to holders of our pre-emergence debt and equity, entitling the warrant holders to exercise the warrants at prices of either 32.59 or 35.41 per share, respectively, of which outstanding warrants may convert into approximately 3.2 million shares (approximately 7 of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The A warrants are exercisable until September 18, 2025, and the series B warrants are exercisable until September 18, 2023, at which respective dates the warrants expire. The future exercise of a large number of warrants, followed by the subsequent sale of the acquired stock into the market, could negatively affect our common stock price. We cannot predict the likelihood of exercise of the warrants or sales of shares of our common stock acquired upon exercise, or the effect of any such sales on the prevailing market price of our common stock. Further, the future exercise of a large number of warrants will dilute our basic earnings per share. 
 
 Risks of Engaging in Significant CCUS Activities 
 
 The CCUS industry, in its infancy, is subject to multiple risks which vary from the risks we face as a mature oil and gas producer. 
 
 The CCUS industry is a relatively new and emerging one. Our ability to successfully be a leader in this industry, especially in the Gulf Coast, is subject to a multitude of risks, many of which are not in our control. Such risks include the uncertainty of 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 evolving regulations of governmental authorities, the availability of necessary equipment for facility construction by our current and future third-party emitters and their related costs, and the attainability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs, all of which are required to build and bring industrial facilities to an operational status. Additionally, CCUS requires (1) captured CO 2 emissions, (2) available CO 2 pipelines, and (3) appropriately tested and prepared storage sites, which may be subject to misaligned timing. As numerous global companies have entered into, or announced plans to enter into the Gulf Coast CCUS market, we expect rigorous competition in building our CCUS operations. 
 
 Our contemplated CCUS operations are anticipated to be cash flow negative for the next several years as we build out CCUS infrastructure, consuming a major share of the excess cash flow from our other operations. 
 
 We are not expecting to generate revenues from our CCUS activities until 2025. In the interim, we will be incurring costs for the development of dedicated CO 2 storage sites which could include front-end engineering design work, feasibility studies and payments to pore space owners, as well as negotiating contracts with present or anticipated emitters of CO 2 , and others. Based upon current oil futures prices, we currently expect that our cashflow from operations will fund most of the Company s capital needs, however we may consider alternative financing options as a supplemental source of capital. Although we believe that CCUS activities should be profitable for the Company over time, there are numerous risks and uncertainties that make its timing and quantification difficult to accurately predict. The financial impact of our expending capital on these activities before realizing CCUS cash flows could negatively impact our financial condition and operational results in future periods. 
 
 The CCUS industry is likely to be subject to rigorous regulatory oversight, as exemplified by PHMSA s 2022 announcement of its intention to initiate new CO 2 pipeline standards and emergency preparedness and response rules. 
 
 Federal, state, and local authorities are likely to mandate rules regarding every aspect of the CCUS industry value chain. The storage of CO 2 is expected to be regulated in a manner similar to the oil and gas industry, with permitting, bonding, reporting, and other requirements, such as the current permitting requirements by the EPA of Class VI wells to inject CO 2 for permanent storage. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining permits, whether or not in a timely manner, nor have rules regarding bonding requirements been fully developed. 
 
 Risks Relating to a Cybersecurity Breach 
 
 A cyber breach could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. 
 
 Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, among other things, to process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic and drilling information; monitor and control pipeline and plant equipment; and process and store personally identifiable information of our employees, industry partners and royalty owners. Cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years. Our technologies, systems and networks, or those of software providers that we use, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could compromise our process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to our business operations, harm to the environment or our assets, disruptions in access to our financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of our critical data and proprietary information, including our business information and that of our employees, partners and other third parties. Successful attacks which disable third-party pipelines or processing facilities upon which we depend could materially adversely affect our operations. Any of the foregoing may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Although we have not incurred any material losses from cyberattacks, future cyberattacks could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability. 
 
 Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing successful attacks from the increasing number of sophisticated intrusions based on technological advances. In addition, in connection with COVID-19 precautions, many of our employees and those of our service providers, vendors and industry partners continue to work remotely from home or other remote-work locations, where cybersecurity protections may be less robust and cybersecurity procedures and safeguards may be less effective. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our procedures and controls or to upgrade our digital and operational systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security, which could increase our costs. The Audit Committee s duties and responsibilities include reviewing and discussing the Company s guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and

 risk management, as well as the Company s major financial and cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Operations and Industry 
 
 Our future performance depends upon our ability to effectively develop our existing oil and natural gas reserves and find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
 Unless we can successfully develop our existing reserves and/or replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations. We have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities. For internal organic growth activities, the magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year depends on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response, especially our development of fields in the CCA area in the Rocky Mountains. In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced, whether due to current oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Further, the process of using CO 2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital investment prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening potential capital constraints. If our capital expenditures are restricted, or if outside capital resources become limited, we will not be able to maintain our current production levels. 
 
 Certain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions or government regulations. 
 
 Our operations in the Gulf Coast region may be subjected to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico, as well as freezing temperatures, ice and snow, that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, which can also increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. Certain of our operations in Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota, the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions including severe cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed or otherwise require that they be conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results of operations in these areas. Further, the potential impacts of climate change on our operations may include extreme weather events and storm patterns, rising sea levels and periods of prolonged high temperatures, the last of which imposes certain physical constraints on our CO 2 injections in our operations in the Gulf Coast. 
 
 Certain of our operations in the Rocky Mountain region subject to seasonal activity, restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks. 
 
 Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, equipment failures; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks; and well control events. In addition, our operations are sometimes near populated commercial or residential areas, which adds additional risks. The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, or limited by, our insurance coverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from coverage as they cannot be insured. 
 
 We could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of our operations. Additionally, a portion of our production activities involves CO 2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators. It is often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs. We may incur significant costs in connection with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local regulations relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO 2 wells. In addition to the increased costs, if wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production. 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

Development activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including: 
 
 unexpected drilling conditions; 
 pressure or irregularities in formations; 
 equipment failures or accidents; 
 adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico, as well as freezing temperatures, ice and snow, that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations; 
 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; 
 the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services; and 
 title problems. 
 
 Our planned tertiary and CCUS operations and the related construction of necessary CO 2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered. 
 
 The production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available CO 2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable. Future extensions of our Green Pipeline, construction to connect third-party CO 2 emitters to storage sites, and preparation for CCUS activities require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners, state and local governments and the federal government in certain areas. Certain states where we operate have considered or may again consider the adoption of laws or regulations that could limit or eliminate the ability of a pipeline owner or of a state, state s legislature or its administrative agencies to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain. We also often conduct Rocky Mountain operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases inhabited by species that may be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which listing may lead to tighter restrictions as to federal land use and other land use where federal approvals are required. These laws and regulations, together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for future pipeline construction projects and may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO 2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our EOR or CCUS operations. 
 
 Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty. 
 
 Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including future production rates, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10 discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a revision of the quantities and net present value of our reserves. 
 
 The reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represents estimates only. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month period preceding the date of the assessment. The representative oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our December 31, 2022 reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, were 93.02 per Bbl for crude oil and 5.14 per Mcf for natural gas. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, operating and development costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 Denbury Inc. 

 effect on our financial condition and operating results. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates. 
 
 The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, most of which we do not control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced. 
 
 The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part, upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation lines owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied. A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. 
 
 We may lose key executive officers or specialized technical employees, which could endanger the future success of our operations. 
 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers, other key management and specialized technical personnel. Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment agreements. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel. Further, with the expansion of the emerging CCUS industry, we have specialized technical employees in high demand for their unique operational experience in EOR activities that would be valuable to our CCUS competitors. 
 
 The loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, two purchasers individually accounted for 10 or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and, in the aggregate, for 38 of such revenues. The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices we receive or the transportation costs we incur.

Our discussion and analysis includes forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K, along with Forward-Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 25, 2022. 
 
 As a result of the Company s emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh start accounting on September 18, 2020 (the Emergence Date ), certain values and operational results of the consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 18, 2020 are not comparable to those in the Company s consolidated financial statements prior to, and including September 18, 2020. References to Successor relate to the results of operations of the Company subsequent to September 18, 2020, and references to Predecessor relate to the results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 18, 2020. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 Denbury is an independent energy company with operations focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions. The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO 2 enhanced oil recovery EOR and the emerging carbon capture, utilization, and storage CCUS industry, supported by the Company s CO 2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO 2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, making the Company s Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions negative today. We have set a target, within the decade, to reach Net Zero for our Scope 1, Scope 2 and those Scope 3 emissions that result from a consumer s use of the oil and natural gas we sell (defined as Category 11 emissions by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol). 
 
 Oil Price Impact on Our Business. Our financial results are significantly impacted by changes in oil prices, as 97 of our sales volumes in 2022 were oil. Changes in oil prices impact all aspects of our business; most notably our cash flows from operations, revenues, capital allocation and budgeting decisions, and oil and natural gas reserves volumes. Oil prices have historically been volatile and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. For example, average NYMEX WTI oil prices increased from the mid- 70s per Bbl range in the fourth quarter of 2021 to an average of approximately 109 per Bbl during the second quarter of 2022 before declining to an average of approximately 83 per Bbl during the fourth quarter of 2022. The increases in oil prices from 2021 levels were largely due to increased demand since the height of the COVID-19 coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, plus the effect on energy markets and prices of the Russian attacks on Ukraine. 
 
 The table below outlines selected financial items and sales volumes, along with changes in our realized oil prices, before and after commodity derivative impacts, over the last three years: 
 Year Ended December 31, In thousands, except per-unit data 2022 2021 2020 Oil, natural gas, and related product sales 1,578,682 1,159,955 693,209 Receipt (payment) on settlements of commodity derivatives (315,752) (277,240) 102,485 Oil, natural gas, and related product sales and commodity settlements, combined 1,262,930 882,715 795,694 Average daily sales (BOE/d) 46,809 48,770 51,151 Average net realized prices Oil price per Bbl - excluding impact of derivative settlements 94.29 66.52 37.78 Oil price per Bbl - including impact of derivative settlements 75.19 50.46 43.40

As shown in the table above, our oil and natural gas revenues have increased dramatically since 2020 due to increases in oil prices. However, the benefit of the increase in revenues during 2021 and 2022 was muted by the impact of higher cash payments on our commodity derivative contracts, which contracts were generally put in place as a requirement under our bank credit facility shortly after we exited bankruptcy. Beginning in the second half of 2022, less of our production was hedged, and our hedges were at more favorable prices and with a greater mix of collars, allowing us to realize a greater portion of increased oil prices. We paid 315.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the settlement of commodity derivative contracts. 
 
 Comparative Financial Results and Highlights. We recognized net income of 480.2 million, or 8.83 per diluted common share during 2022, and net income of 56.0 million, or 1.04 per diluted common share during 2021. Drivers of the comparative operating results between 2022 and 2021 include the following: 
 
 Oil and natural gas revenues increased by 418.7 million (36 in 2022, all attributable to higher commodity prices, slightly offset by lower sales volumes; 
 Commodity derivative expense decreased by 174.2 million consisting of a 212.8 million improvement in noncash fair value changes between periods 137.0 million gain during 2022 compared to a 75.7 million loss during 2021), partially offset by a 38.6 million increase in cash payments upon derivative contract settlements 315.8 million in payments during 2022 compared to 277.2 million in payments during 2021). 
 Lease operating expenses increased by 77.9 million (18 ), primarily due to higher power and fuel costs and workover costs from inflation and higher activity levels; and 
 Taxes other than income increased 40.1 million primarily due to an increase in production taxes resulting from higher oil and gas revenues. 
 
 Common Share Repurchase Program. In early May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program for up to 250 million of outstanding Denbury common stock. During June and July 2022, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of Denbury common stock under this program for approximately 100 million, at an average price of 61.92 per share. In August 2022, the Board increased Denbury s stock repurchase authorization by 100 million, thus a total of 250 million of common stock currently remains authorized for future repurchases under this program. The program has no pre-established ending date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of its common stock under the program. 
 
 Cedar Creek Anticline CO 2 EOR Development. In early February 2022, we commenced CO 2 injection in the first phase of our CCA EOR project. In order to stay ahead of potential supply chain delays, and to prepare for earlier processing of CO 2 based on CO 2 injection levels being at the high end of our expectations, we increased capital investment in the second half of 2022 at CCA to accelerate our procurement of compression equipment and construction of CO 2 recycle facilities to ensure facilities are in place to handle anticipated production from the field. We continue to expect tertiary oil production response from CCA in the second half of 2023. In addition, drilling and facility construction at the Company s Pennel CO 2 pilot, in advance of Phase 2 development of CCA, commenced during the third quarter. 
 
 Advancing Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Activities. CCUS is a process that captures CO 2 from industrial sources and either reuses or stores the CO 2 in geologic formations in order to prevent its release into the atmosphere. We utilize CO 2 from industrial sources in our EOR operations, and our extensive CO 2 pipeline infrastructure and operations, particularly in the Gulf Coast, are strategically located in close proximity to both large sources of industrial emissions and geological formations well-suited for permanent CO 2 storage. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 40 of the CO 2 utilized in our operated oil iand gas operations was industrial-sourced CO 2 . This compares to 33 utilized during the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that the assets and technical expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with our existing CO 2 EOR operations, providing us with a significant advantage and opportunity to lead in the emerging CCUS industry, as the building of a permanent carbon capture and storage business by others requires both time and capital to build assets such as those we own and have been operating for years. 
 
 We have been seeking to build our CCUS business and pursue new CCUS opportunities on two fronts: first, we have been engaged with existing and potential third-party industrial CO 2 emitters regarding CO 2 transportation and storage solutions under long term agreements; second, we have been identifying and securing potential future storage sites for permanent CO 2 storage. In 2023, our goals include continuing to capture more of the emissions market and adding storage sites to our portfolio. We also plan to drill stratigraphic wells, submit additional Class VI storage permits for our contracted sites, and purchase long-lead

time items for network buildout. We currently have signed agreements covering the potential future transportation and storage of up to 20 Mmtpa from the planned capture of CO 2 emissions from existing and proposed industrial plants. On the sequestration front, we have also signed agreements securing the rights to seven future storage sites which we believe have the potential to store up to 2 billion metric tons of CO 2 . Initial CCUS transportation and/or storage volumes are anticipated in 2025 and we are projecting those volumes could increase to an average of 50 70 Mmtpa by 2030. 
 
 While our use of CO 2 in EOR is currently reflected in our historical financial and operational results (as a cost), we believe the incentives offered under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code and the expansion of those incentives under the August 2022 Inflation Reduction Act will drive demand for CCUS and allow us to collect a fee for the transportation and storage of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 . Although we believe our first revenues associated with the storage of CO 2 will likely occur in 2025, we are currently incurring costs to engineer, conduct feasibility studies and otherwise develop and permit storage sites, along with payments to pore space owners, and will continue to advance those efforts over the next several years. In addition, we will need to expand our CO 2 pipeline network to connect to emission sites and storage sites. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we capitalized 65.0 million in CCUS storage sites and related assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, primarily consisting of acquisition costs associated with storage sites. On a long-term forward-looking basis, we currently estimate that cumulative capital investments for CCUS projects and initiatives between 2023 and 2030 will total between 1.6 billion and 2 billion with an average of 200 million to 250 million per year, and will be focused on CO 2 storage site development and pipeline costs. The highest investment period is expected in 2024 and 2025 as we plan to continue construction and development of multiple sequestration sites, including drilling Class VI injection wells and installing pipeline extensions to connect to storage sites and industrial emissions. Currently, we anticipate we can internally fund CCUS capital expenditures from free cash flows through 2030 assuming a minimum of 60 NYMEX WTI oil prices, although we may consider alternative financing options as a supplemental source of capital. As early as 2026 or 2027, we expect the CCUS business will be generating cash flows that could internally fund its development. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 Overview. Our cash flows from operations and availability under our senior secured bank credit facility are our primary sources of capital and liquidity. Our most significant cash capital outlays relate to our oil and gas development capital expenditures and CCUS initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 520.7 million in cash flow from operations, invested net cash of 427.9 million in oil and gas and CCUS activities, and utilized net cash of 95.3 million in financing activities, primarily associated with 100.0 million of Denbury common stock purchased under the Company s stock repurchase program. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 29.0 million of outstanding borrowings and 10.1 million of outstanding letters of credit under our 750 million senior secured bank credit facility, leaving us with 710.9 million of borrowing base availability. This liquidity is more than adequate to meet our currently planned operating and capital needs. As further discussed below, based on oil price futures as of the middle of February 2023, we currently anticipate funding all of our 2023 capital budget from projected operating cash flow. 
 
 Capital Expenditure Summary. For purposes of tracking and comparing our capital budget to capital expenditure activity, we utilize data reflective of when capital expenditures are incurred, which is generally different than what is reported

in our cash flow statements, which reflects when cash is actually paid. The information included in the following table reflects incurred capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:

 (1) Capital expenditures in this summary are presented on an as-incurred basis (including accruals), and are 27.3 million higher, 35.7 million higher, and 10.9 million lower than the capital expenditures in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which are presented on a cash paid basis. 
 (2) Includes pre-production CO 2 costs associated with the CCA EOR development project totaling 23.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 (3) Includes capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs and pre-production tertiary startup costs. 
 (4) Primarily consists of working interest positions in the Wind River Basin enhanced oil recovery fields acquired on March 3, 2021. 
 (5) Represents an investment made during the third quarter of 2022 in the project development company Clean Hydrogen Works of a planned blue hydrogen/ammonia multi-block facility, while also signing a definitive agreement for the transportation and storage of CO 2 for the first two blocks of the proposed plant. The investment is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. We have committed to invest another 10 million when certain project milestones are achieved, which is currently projected to occur in 2023. 
 
 Supply Chain Issues and Potential Cost Inflation. Worldwide and U.S. supply chain issues, together with higher commodity prices, power costs, service costs and tight labor markets in the U.S., increased our costs beginning in late 2021 and continued throughout 2022. Although the level of inflationary cost increases and supply chain issues has begun to level off in certain areas, we still expect additional cost and demand increases in certain categories of goods, services and wages in our operations during 2023 which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. See Results of Operations Production Expenses below for further discussion. 
 
 2023 Plans and Capital Budget. We estimate our total oil and natural gas development capital expenditures in 2023, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest, will be in a range of 350 million to 370 million, and our CCUS capital expenditures will be in a range of 140 million to 160 million. At the combined midpoint of 510 million, total capital expenditures are 19 higher than expenditures in 2022, with the expected 2023 increases driven entirely by higher CCUS capital expenditures, which are primarily for the development of dedicated CO 2 storage sites and preparation for expansion of our CO 2 pipelines. In addition to the Company s budgeted capital expenditures, we expect to incur approximately 17 million for CCUS equity investments and approximately 36 million for plugging and abandonment costs. 
 
 Based on the Company s projections, including estimated production, costs, oil price differentials and other assumptions, we currently anticipate our 2023 cash flows from operations, excluding working capital changes, will approximately meet or exceed our budgeted 2023 capital expenditures and planned asset retirement obligation activities, assuming oil prices of

approximately 75 per Bbl in 2023. Also, at December 31, 2022, we had 710.9 million of availability under our bank credit facility, which we believe is more than adequate to cover any near-term liquidity needs. 
 
 Senior Secured Bank Credit Agreement. In September 2020, we entered into a 575 million bank credit agreement for a senior secured revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (the Bank Credit Agreement ). Under the Bank Credit Agreement, letters of credit are available in an aggregate amount not to exceed 100 million, and short-term swingline loans are available in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25 million, each subject to the available commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement. Availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which is redetermined semiannually on or around May 1 and November 1 of each year. The borrowing base is adjusted at the lenders discretion and is based, in part, upon external factors over which we have no control. If our outstanding debt under the Bank Credit Agreement exceeds the then-effective borrowing base, we would be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed six months. 
 
 On May 4, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement, which among other things: 
 
 Increased the borrowing base and lender commitments from 575 million to 750 million; 
 Extended the maturity date from January 30, 2024 to May 4, 2027; 
 Modified the interest provisions on loans under the Bank Credit Agreement to (1) reduce the applicable margin for alternate base rate loans from 2 to 3 per annum to 1.5 to 2.5 per annum and (2) replace provisions referencing LIBOR loans with Secured Overnight Financing Rate loans, with an applicable margin of 2.5 to 3.5 per annum; and 
 Permitted us to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock and make other unlimited restricted payments and investments so long as (1) no event of default or borrowing base deficiency exists; (2) our total leverage ratio is 1.5 to 1 or lower; and (3) availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is at least 20 of the borrowing base. 
 
 As part of our Fall 2022 semiannual borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base and lender commitments for our Bank Credit Agreement were reaffirmed at 750 million, with our next scheduled redetermination around May 1, 2023. 
 
 On January 20, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement, targeted at providing us the ability to elect to make interest payments on certain SOFR loans on a weekly basis. 
 
 The Bank Credit Agreement limits our ability to, among other things, incur and repay other indebtedness; grant liens; engage in certain mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; engage in sales of assets; make acquisitions and investments; make other restricted payments (including redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our common stock); and enter into commodity derivative agreements, in each case subject to certain exceptions to such limitations, as specified in the Bank Credit Agreement. Our Bank Credit Agreement required certain minimum commodity hedge levels in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy; however, these conditions were met as of December 31, 2020, and we currently have no ongoing hedging requirements under the Bank Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Bank Credit Agreement contains certain financial performance covenants including the following: 
 
 A Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX covenant (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement), with such ratio not to exceed 3.5 times; and 
 A requirement to maintain a current ratio (i.e., Consolidated Current Assets to Consolidated Current Liabilities) of 1.0. 
 
 For purposes of computing the current ratio per the Bank Credit Agreement, Consolidated Current Assets exclude the current portion of derivative assets but include available borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement, and Consolidated Current Liabilities exclude the current portion of derivative liabilities as well as the current portions of long-term indebtedness outstanding. Under these financial performance covenant calculations, as of December 31, 2022, our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDAX was 0.05 to 1.0 (with a maximum permitted ratio of 3.5 to 1.0) and our current ratio was 2.70 to 1.0 (with a required ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0). Based upon our currently forecasted levels of production and costs, hedges in place as of February 22, 2023, and current oil commodity futures prices, we currently anticipate continuing to be in compliance with our financial performance covenants during the foreseeable future. 
 
 The above description of our Bank Credit Agreement is qualified by the express language and defined terms contained in the Bank Credit Agreement and amendments thereto, each of which is filed as an exhibit to our periodic reports filed with the

Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10(d) to the Form 10-Q filed on May 6, 2022, contains the full text of the current version of the Bank Credit Agreement inclusive of all changes made by virtue of both the First and Second Amendments thereto. 
 
 Commitments, Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We incur numerous contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business including debt service requirements, operating leases, purchase obligations, and asset retirement obligations. Our operating leases primarily consist of our office leases. Our purchase obligations represent future cash commitments primarily for purchase contracts for CO 2 captured from industrial sources, CO 2 processing fees, transportation agreements and well-related costs. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include obligations for various development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal oil and gas or CCUS capital expenditure program or from other transactions common to our industry, none of which are recorded on our balance sheet. During 2022, we entered into storage contracts to secure rights to underground pore space in anticipation of future CCUS operations. Noncancelable commitments under those contracts total 4 million. In addition, in order to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs estimated in our proved reserve reports. Certain of these capital spending plans are further described in 2023 Plans and Capital Budget above. For a further discussion of our future development costs, see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our periodic obligations include operational expenses that we anticipate being paid out of our cash flow from sale of production, plus the capital expenditures detailed above. In addition to these periodic expenditures, we have various future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December 31, 2022. The most material of these commitments within the next 12 months include: 
 
 Approximately 52.0 million under contracts for the purchase of CO 2 captured from industrial sources and for processing fees related to our overriding royalty interest in the CO 2 at LaBarge Field, both of which are used in our tertiary recovery activities, assuming a 75 per Bbl NYMEX oil price. The commitment level declines in 2023 and again in 2028 due to the expiration of the current term of certain industrial-CO 2 purchase commitments (see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion); and 
 Approximately 6 million in operating lease obligations (see Note 5, Leases , to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). 
 
 In addition to these commitments, we have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting, engineering and legal fees; software maintenance; subscriptions; and other overhead-type items. Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses. Most of these recurring expenditures could be quickly canceled with regard to any specific vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for our ongoing normal operations. Other commitments include certain transportation agreements and well-related costs. Our longer-term commitments that extend beyond the next 12 months include the following: 
 
 Obligations and periodic interest payments under our senior secured bank credit facility, which matures on May 4, 2027, and of which 29.0 million of borrowings and 10.1 million of letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2022; and 
 Asset retirement obligations related to future costs associated with plugging and abandoning our oil, natural gas and CO 2 wells, removing equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and returning land to its original condition (see Note 6, Asset Retirement Obligations , to the consolidated financial statements). 
 
 As detailed throughout this report, the largest determinant of our cash flow is the oil price we receive. Oil prices and cash flow are highly impacted by worldwide oil supply and fluctuations in demand due to economic activity, which volatility we attempt to offset to some extent with our hedging program. The variability of proceeds from the sale of our production is partially offset by similar directional variances in certain expenses, including a portion of our lease operating expenses and production taxes, as these expenses correlate to some degree with changes in oil prices.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW OF TERTIARY OPERATIONS 
 
 Our tertiary operations represent a significant portion of our overall operations. The economics of a tertiary field and the related impact on our financial statements differ from a conventional oil and gas play and are explained further below. 
 
 While it is difficult to accurately forecast future production, we believe our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long-term production growth potential at reasonable return metrics, with relatively low risk, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects. We have been developing tertiary oil properties for over 23 years, and the financial impact of such operations is reflected in our historical financial statements. The summary below highlights our observations regarding how tertiary operations have impacted our financial statements. 
 
 Finding and Development Costs. We currently expect finding and development costs (including future development and abandonment costs but excluding CO 2 pipeline infrastructure capital expenditures) over the life of each field to be competitive with the industry average costs for other oil properties. See the definition of finding and development costs in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations . 
 
 Timing of Capital Costs. When initiating a new tertiary flood, there generally is a delay between the initial capital expenditures and the resulting production increases. We must build facilities, and often a CO 2 pipeline to the field, before CO 2 flooding can commence, and it usually takes six to twelve months before the field responds to the injection of CO 2 (i.e., oil production commences). For certain fields such as those in CCA, we estimate it could take up to 18 months or longer for a tertiary production response to occur. Further, we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proved reserves from fields we flood and, even after a field has proved reserves, significant amounts of additional capital will usually be required to fully develop the field. 
 
 Recognition of Proved Reserves. In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood. The magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods, the timing of the production response from new floods and the performance of our existing floods. 
 
 Production Rates. The production rate at a tertiary flood can vary from quarter to quarter, as a tertiary field s production may increase rapidly when wells respond to the CO 2 , plateau temporarily, and then resume growth as additional areas of the field are developed. During a tertiary flood life cycle, facility capacity is increased from time to time, which occasionally requires temporary shutdowns during installation, thereby causing temporary declines in production. We also find it difficult to precisely predict when any given well will respond to the injected CO 2 , as the CO 2 seldom travels through the rock consistently due to heterogeneity in the oil-bearing formations. We find all of these fluctuations to be normal and generally expect oil production at a tertiary field to increase over time until the field is fully developed, albeit sometimes in inconsistent patterns. 
 
 Operating Costs. Tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than traditional industry operations because of the cost of injecting and recycling the CO 2 (primarily due to the cost of the CO 2 and the significant energy requirements to re-compress the CO 2 back into a near-liquid state for re-injection purposes). The costs of our CO 2 and the electricity required to recycle and inject this CO 2 comprise over half of our typical tertiary operating expenses. Since these costs vary along with commodity and commercial electricity prices, they are highly variable and will increase in a high-commodity-price environment and decrease in a low-price environment. The cost of purchasing and/or producing CO 2 for use in tertiary floods is allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO 2 is injected. These costs have historically represented approximately 20 to 25 of the total operating costs for our tertiary operations. Since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our CO 2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), operating costs per barrel for a new flood will be higher at the inception of CO 2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time.

 (2) Includes Salt Creek and Grieve fields. 
 (3) Includes non-tertiary sales volumes from Wind River Basin, as well as Hartzog Draw and Bell Creek fields. 
 (4) Includes non-tertiary sales related to the March 2020 sale of 50 of our working interests in Webster, Thompson, Manvel, and East Hastings fields (the Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale ). 
 
 Total sales volumes during 2022 averaged 46,809 BOE/d, including 32,004 Bbls/d from tertiary properties and 14,805 BOE/d from non-tertiary properties. This total sales volume represents a decrease of 1,961 BOE/d (4 compared to 2021 total sales volumes. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to natural field declines associated with low levels of development spending in recent years (excluding new CO 2 EOR development at CCA), partially offset by increased production at Wind River Basin, which was acquired in March 2021, due both to the inclusion in 2022 of a full year of production as well

as post-acquisition development activities, and increases at Grieve Field as a result of CO 2 injection response. Our production during 2022 was 97 oil, consistent with 2021 and 2020. 
 
 Based on our capital spending plans, we currently anticipate 2023 average daily production will be between 46,000 BOE/d and 49,000 BOE/d, which, at its midpoint is 691 BOE/d higher than our average production in 2022. We anticipate first production from the CCA CO 2 EOR development in the second half of 2023, which is the primary driver for our expected production increase in 2023. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Revenues 
 
 Oil and natural gas revenues increased 36 between 2021 and 2022 and increased 67 between 2020 and 2021. The changes in our oil and natural gas revenues are due to changes in production quantities and realized commodity prices (excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts), as reflected in the following table: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. 2020 In thousands Increase (Decrease) in Revenues Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Revenues Increase (Decrease) in Revenues Percentage Increase (Decrease) in Revenues Change in oil and natural gas revenues due to: Decrease in production (46,646) (4) (34,069) (5) Increase in commodity prices 465,373 40 500,815 72 Total increase in oil and natural gas revenues 418,727 36 466,746 67 
 
 Excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts, our average net realized commodity prices and NYMEX differentials were as follows during 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Average net realized prices Oil price per Bbl 94.29 66.52 37.78 Natural gas price per Mcf 5.93 3.66 1.44 Price per BOE 92.40 65.16 37.03 Average NYMEX differentials Gulf Coast region Oil per Bbl (0.19) (1.42) (1.14) Natural gas per Mcf (0.08) 0.26 (0.14) Rocky Mountain region Oil per Bbl 0.02 (1.32) (2.80) Natural gas per Mcf (0.87) (0.27) (1.36) Total Company Oil per Bbl (0.10) (1.38) (1.81) Natural gas per Mcf (0.58) (0.05) (0.69) 
 
 Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality, and location differentials. 
 
 Gulf Coast Region . Our average NYMEX oil differential in the Gulf Coast region was a negative 0.19 per Bbl in 2022 and a negative 1.42 per Bbl during 2021. During 2022, the Company benefited from improved Light Louisiana Sweet LLS pricing for its Gulf Coast grades relative to NYMEX WTI prices. For our crude oil sold under LLS index prices, the 
 
 46

LLS-to-NYMEX differential averaged a positive 2.25 per Bbl on a trade-month basis during 2022, compared to a positive 1.49 per Bbl differential during 2021. 
 
 Rocky Mountain Region. NYMEX oil differentials in the Rocky Mountain region averaged 0.02 per Bbl above NYMEX during 2022, compared to an average differential of 1.32 per Bbl below NYMEX in 2021. Differentials in the Rocky Mountain region generally fluctuate with regional supply and demand trends and can fluctuate significantly on a month-to-month basis due to weather, refinery or transportation issues, and Canadian and U.S. crude oil price index volatility. 
 
 CO 2 Revenues and Expenses 
 
 We sell a portion of the CO 2 we produce from Jackson Dome to third-party industrial users at various contracted prices primarily under long-term contracts. We recognize the revenue received on these CO 2 sales as CO 2 sales and transportation fees with the corresponding costs recognized as CO 2 operating and discovery expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. CO 2 sales and transportation fees were 60.6 million during 2022, compared to 44.2 million during 2021. The increase from the prior-year period was primarily due to revenues received pursuant to a short-term contractual agreement that ended during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 Oil Marketing Revenues and Purchases 
 
 In certain situations, we purchase and subsequently sell oil from third parties. We recognize the revenue received and the associated expenses incurred on these sales on a gross basis as Oil marketing revenues and Oil marketing purchases in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Commodity Derivative Contracts 
 
 We have routinely entered into oil derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. These contracts have historically consisted of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put, and basis swaps. 
 
 The following tables summarize the impact our commodity derivative contracts had on our operating results for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended In thousands March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Full Year 2022 Payment on settlements of commodity derivatives (93,057) (127,959) (55,780) (38,956) (315,752) Noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives (99,662) 71,105 165,028 537 137,008 Commodity derivatives income (expense) (192,719) (56,854) 109,248 (38,419) (178,744)

Predecessor Successor Three Months Ended Period from July 1 through September 18 Period from September 19 through September 30 Three Months Ended In thousands March 31 June 30 December 31 Full Year 2020 Receipt on settlements of commodity derivatives 24,638 45,629 11,129 6,660 14,429 102,485 Noncash fair value gains (losses) on commodity derivatives 122,133 (85,759) (15,738) (2,625) (80,366) (62,355) Commodity derivatives income (expense) 146,771 (40,130) (4,609) 4,035 (65,937) 40,130 
 
 Commodity derivatives income (expense) is comprised of (1) payments or receipts on settlements of commodity derivatives and (2) changes in the fair values of commodity derivatives. Changes in the fair values of commodity derivatives are due to the expiration of commodity derivative contracts and changes in oil futures prices since the prior period or subsequent to entering into new derivative agreements. During 2022, we paid 315.8 million upon expiration of commodity derivative contracts, compared to cash payments upon settlement of 277.2 million during 2021. 
 
 In order to provide a level of price protection to our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2024 using NYMEX fixed-price swaps and costless collars. Upon emergence from bankruptcy in September 2020, we were required to hedge through mid-2022 at certain levels of estimated production under our post-emergence bank credit facility. Those hedges resulted in significant cash losses to us during 2021 and 2022 as oil prices subsequently improved beyond our hedged prices. We no longer have any hedging requirements under our bank credit facility; however, we plan to continue to hedge a portion of our production in order to provide a level of certainty in our cash flows. See Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts , to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of our outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022, and Market Risk Management below for additional discussion. In addition, the following table summarizes our oil derivative contracts as of February 22, 2023: 
 1H 2023 2H 2023 1H 2024 2H 2024 WTI NYMEX Volumes Hedged (Bbls/d) 9,500 14,000 2,000 1,000 Fixed-Price Swaps Weighted Average Swap Price

 Based on current contracts in place and NYMEX oil futures prices as of February 22, 2023, which averaged approximately 74 per Bbl for the remainder of 2023, we currently expect that we would receive cash receipts of approximately 19 million during 2023 upon settlement of these contracts, the amount of which is primarily dependent upon fluctuations in future NYMEX oil prices in relation to the prices of our 2023 fixed-price swaps (which have a weighted average NYMEX oil price of 77.74 per Bbl). See Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts , to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Changes in commodity prices, expiration of contracts, and new commodity contracts entered into cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil derivative contracts. Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the period-to-period changes in the fair value of these contracts, as outlined above, are recognized in our statements of operations.

 Lease Operating Expenses 
 Successor Predecessor Year Ended Dec. 31, 2022 Year Ended Dec. 31, 2021 Period from Sept. 19, 2020 through Dec. 31, 2020 Period from Jan. 1, 2020 through Sept. 18, 2020 In thousands, except per-BOE data Total lease operating expenses 502,409 424,550 101,234 250,271 Total lease operating expenses per BOE 29.41 23.85 19.90 18.36 
 
 Total lease operating expenses were 502.4 million, or 29.41 per BOE, during 2022, compared to 424.6 million, or 23.85 per BOE, during 2021. The 77.9 million (18 increase on an absolute-dollar basis was the result of a 22.6 million increase for special items and a 55.3 million increase due primarily to inflation and higher activity levels. The increase on a per BOE basis was further impacted by lower production in the current year period. 
 
 Special items driving the increase in year-over-year LOE include (1) a 16.1 million non-recurring benefit in 2021 resulting from compensation under certain of the Company s power agreements for power interruption during the severe winter storm in February 2021, (2) an additional 13.2 million of LOE in 2022 reflecting an entire 12 months worth expenses from our March 2021 acquisition of Wind River Basin properties, offset in part by (3) a 6.7 million benefit in 2022 for an insurance reimbursement of for property damage costs incurred during 2013 at Delhi Field. 
 
 Lifting cost excluding the special items increased 13 in 2022 compared to 2021. Inflation and higher activity levels resulted in higher power and fuel costs 19.6 million), workover costs 13.6 million), labor costs 8.2 million), and CO 2 purchase costs 2.7 million), as well as other increases. 
 
 We currently expect lease operating expenses during 2023 to increase slightly from 2022 levels as a result of CO 2 cost increases (primarily due to a contractual price change under an existing industrial CO 2 contract), inflationary impacts to cost categories such as company and contract labor, and the absence in 2023 of the 6.7 million Delhi Field insurance reimbursement. 
 
 Transportation and Marketing Expenses 
 
 Transportation and marketing expenses primarily consist of amounts incurred related to the transportation, marketing, and processing of oil and natural gas production. Transportation and marketing expenses were 20.1 million during 2022, compared to 28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease between periods was primarily due to a change in the sales contracts of certain of our production, which reduced our transportation expense. 
 
 Taxes Other than Income 
 
 Taxes other than income, which includes production, ad valorem and franchise taxes, were 131.5 million during 2022, compared to 91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase between periods was primarily due to an increase in production taxes resulting from higher oil and natural gas revenues.

 Our G A expense on an absolute-dollar basis was 82.2 million during 2022, compared to 79.3 million during 2021. The 23 increase in our cash G A expenses during 2022 was primarily associated with increased employee headcount and professional services while the decrease in stock-based compensation in 2022 is due to the absence in 2022 of expense associated with the 2021 vesting of performance-based equity awards which were granted in late 2020. Although the performance criteria for these performance-based equity awards were met in 2021, the shares underlying these awards are not currently outstanding as under the terms of these awards actual delivery of the shares is not scheduled to occur until after the end of the performance period, no earlier than December 4, 2023. We currently expect G A expense to increase in 2023 due to the inclusion in 2023 of a full year of expense associated with employees hired in 2022, additional headcount increases anticipated during 2023, and the cumulative expense for long-term equity incentive awards, with 2023 being the third full year of expense following emergence. A significant portion of the Company s planned headcount additions in 2023 are related to the Company s expanding CCUS activities. We currently expect our stock-based compensation to range between 22 million and 26 million in 2023.

 (1) Accelerated depreciation in 2021 represents an accelerated depreciation charge related to capitalized amounts associated with unevaluated properties that were transferred to the full cost pool. 
 
 DD A expense was 151.4 million during 2022, compared to 150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 1 increase during 2022 compared to the 2021 period was primarily due to an accelerated depreciation charge. The slight increase related to oil and natural gas properties is the result of an increase in the accretion of our asset retirement obligations, largely offset by a lower depletion rate from an increase in our estimate of proved reserves between the periods based on higher commodity pricing. Our oil and natural gas properties depletion rate was 7.69 per BOE during the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect DD A expense will be higher subsequent to the initial booking of proved reserves at our new CCA CO 2 flood, which we currently estimate will occur during 2023. 
 
 Full Cost Pool Ceiling Test 
 
 Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter (as well as at the end of the Predecessor period) to perform a ceiling test calculation. Under these rules, the full cost ceiling value is calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period. We recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write-down of 14.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, with first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices for the preceding 12 months averaging 36.40 per Bbl, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field. The write-down was primarily a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures which was recorded based on a valuation that utilized NYMEX strip oil prices at the acquisition date, which were significantly higher than the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices used to value the cost ceiling. 
 
 2020 Reorganization Items, Net 
 
 Reorganization items, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the 2020 Predecessor period included (i) expenses incurred during the Company s prepackaged voluntary bankruptcy subsequent to the Petition Date as a direct result of the Plan, (ii) gains or losses from liabilities settled and (iii) fresh start accounting adjustments. Professional service provider charges associated with our restructuring that were incurred outside of this period (before the Petition Date and after the Emergence Date) were recorded in Other expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Other Expenses 
 
 Other expenses totaled 16.3 million during 2022 and primarily includes 4.9 million related to CCUS, a 3.9 million accrual for a preliminarily assessed civil penalty proposed by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation in a Notice of Probable Violation (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings Notice of Probable Violation from Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA Regarding Delta-Tinsley CO 2 Pipeline Failure ), and 3.7 million related to plant operating expenses. Other expenses totaled 10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and primarily includes plant operating expenses, litigation accruals and noncash fair value adjustments for contingent consideration payments related to our March 2021 Wind River Basin CO 2 EOR field acquisition, slightly offset by insurance reimbursements for previously-incurred costs associated with the February 2020 Delta-Tinsley CO 2 pipeline repair.

 Our income tax provisions were based on an estimated combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 25 for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than our estimated statutory rate, primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. 
 
 We make estimates and judgements in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgements occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances, and in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. The realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in the applicable carryback or carryforward periods. In our assessment, we consider the nature, frequency, and severity of current

and cumulative losses, as well as historical and forecasted financial results, the overall business environment, our industry s historic cyclicality, the reversal of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities, and tax planning strategies. 
 
 We assess the valuation allowance recorded on our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2021 we had a 125.5 million valuation allowance recorded against our federal and certain state deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was initially recorded in September 2020 after the application of fresh start accounting, as (1) the tax basis of our assets, primarily our oil and gas properties, was in excess of the carrying value, as adjusted for fresh start accounting and (2) our historical pre-tax income reflected a three-year cumulative loss primarily due to ceiling test write-downs and reorganization items that were recorded in 2020. While we continue to be in a cumulative three-year-loss position through 2022, we initially determined on March 31, 2022, that there was sufficient positive evidence, primarily related to a substantial increase in worldwide oil prices and taxable income generated from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, to conclude that our federal and certain state deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, we reversed 51.4 million and 14.8 million of our federal and state valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of 59.2 million for certain state tax benefits that we currently do not expect to realize before their expiration. 
 
 We have 0.6 million of alternative minimum tax credits, which under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will be refunded in 2023 and are recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet. Our state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years, starting in 2025. The statutes of limitation for our income tax returns for tax years ending prior to 2019 have lapsed and therefore are not subject to examination by respective taxing authorities. Our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be approximately 25 with current taxes anticipated to represent 5 to 10 of total taxes.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 Debt and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 29.0 million of outstanding borrowing under our Bank Credit Agreement. At this level of variable-rate debt, an increase or decrease of 10 in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our interest expense. Our Bank Credit Agreement does not have any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies. The following table presents the principal and fair values of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022: 
 In thousands 2022-2026 2027 Total Fair Value Variable rate debt Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility (weighted average interest rate of 9.0 at December 31, 2022) 29,000 29,000 29,000 
 
 Commodity Derivative Contracts 
 
 We enter into oil derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Over the last few years, these contracts have consisted of costless collars and fixed-price swaps. The production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt, financial strength, expectation of future commodity prices, and occasionally requirements under our bank credit facility. We currently have no hedging requirements under our Bank Credit Agreement. In order to provide a level of price protection to our oil production, we have hedged a portion of our estimated oil production through 2024 using NYMEX fixed-price swaps and costless collars. Depending on market conditions, we may continue to add to our existing 2023 and 2024 hedges. See also Note 12, Commodity Derivative Contracts , and Note 13 , Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts. 
 
 All of the mark-to-market valuations used for our commodity derivatives are provided by external sources. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our senior secured bank credit facility (or affiliates of such lenders). We have included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our commodity derivative contracts, which we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads. 
 
 For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts. This means that any changes in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts are charged to earnings instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our commodity derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net asset of 2.5 million, a 137.0 million change from the 134.5 million net liability recorded at December 31, 2021. This change is related to the expiration of commodity derivative contracts during 2022, new commodity derivative contracts entered into during 2022 for future periods, and to the changes in oil futures prices between December 31, 2021 and 2022.

Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 Based on NYMEX oil futures prices and derivative contracts in place as of December 31, 2022, and assuming both a 10 increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make payments on our crude oil derivative contracts as shown in the following table: 
 
 In thousands Receipt / (Payment) Based on: Futures prices as of December 31, 2022 (3,735) 10 increase in prices (38,241) 10 decrease in prices 32,685 
 
 Our commodity derivative contracts are used as an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future production. As a result, changes in receipts or payments on our commodity derivative contracts due to changes in commodity prices, as reflected in the above table, would be mostly offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the cash receipts on sales of our oil production to which those commodity derivative contracts relate. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make certain estimates and judgments. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. 
 
 Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
 Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Another acceptable method of accounting for oil and natural gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting. In general, the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment. Under the full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred. In the assessment of impairment of oil and natural gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations. Under the full cost method, the full cost pool (net book value of oil and natural gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10 using the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period through the end of each quarterly reporting period. The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies. Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC (see below), and as a result, these contracts are not considered in the full cost ceiling test. 
 
 We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and natural gas revenues, production, capitalized costs and operating expenses. We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and analysis of historical results and trends. While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as revisions in estimated oil and natural gas volumes, changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re-allocations by the purchasers or pipelines, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry, many of which will require retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs.

Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare reported estimates, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures. Over the last three years, annual revisions to our reserve estimates, excluding any revisions related to changes in commodity prices, have averaged approximately 4.8 of the previous year s estimates and have been both positive and negative. 
 
 Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities. These changes in quantities affect our DD A rate, and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation. For example, we estimate that a 5 increase in our estimate of proved reserve quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2022 oil and natural gas property DD A rate from 7.69 per BOE to approximately 7.38 per BOE, and a 5 decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DD A rate to approximately 8.02 per BOE. Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values, determined solely by our lenders, are the primary factors in determining the maximum borrowing base under our senior secured bank credit facility, particularly quantities and values of our proved developed producing reserves. 
 
 Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter (as well as at the end of the Predecessor period) to perform a ceiling test calculation. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10 ), based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects. Our future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO 2 reserves nor those related to the cost of constructing CO 2 pipelines, as we do not have to incur additional CO 2 capital costs to develop the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO 2 costs related to CO 2 reserves and CO 2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly. 
 
 The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, was 93.02 at December 31, 2022, 63.86 at December 31, 2021, 35.84 at December 31, 2020, and 40.08 at September 18, 2020. We recognized a full cost pool ceiling test write-down of 14.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, with first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices for the preceding 12 months averaging 36.40 per Bbl, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field. The write-down was primarily a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures which was recorded based on a valuation that utilized NYMEX strip oil prices at the acquisition date, which were significantly higher than the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices used to value the cost ceiling. Primarily as a result of commodity price declines during 2020, the Predecessor recognized full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of 996.7 million during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, and an additional full cost pool ceiling test write-down of 1.0 million was recognized during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020. 
 
 We exclude certain unevaluated costs from the amortization base and full cost ceiling test pending the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. The costs classified as unevaluated are transferred to the full cost amortization base as the properties are developed, tested and evaluated. At least annually, we test these assets for impairment based on an evaluation of management s expectations of future pricing, evaluation of lease expiration terms, and planned project development activities. Given the significant declines in NYMEX oil prices in March and April 2020 due to the oil supply and demand imbalance precipitated by the dramatic fall in demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the concurrent OPEC+ decision to increase oil supply, we reassessed our development plans and transferred 244.9

million of our unevaluated costs to the full cost pool during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in our oil and natural gas properties, including unevaluated properties, being recorded at their fair values at the Emergence Date (see Note 2, Fresh Start Accounting , for additional information). 
 
 Tertiary Injection Costs 
 
 Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO 2 injection, until we can demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. Our costs associated with the CO 2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our cash out-of-pocket costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties. 
 
 We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO 2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs until we are able to recognize proved oil reserves associated with the development project. After we see a production response to the CO 2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred, and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion. We capitalized 32.8 million of tertiary injection costs associated with our tertiary projects during 2022, 7.6 million during 2021, 2.3 million during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and 16.2 million during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. 
 
 CCUS Asset Allocation 
 
 The Company has entered into numerous storage agreements that provide a right to inject CO 2 into the pore space (sub-surface) and access the surface above the pore space. The agreements do not give the Company ownership of the land, but instead require payment of annual fees for these rights. Denbury recognizes the rights to the surface and subsurface as intangible assets, and will capitalize and depreciate the related contract costs. Denbury will allocate payments between the surface and the subsurface based upon the fair value of surface assets versus subsurface assets. The surface assets will be depreciated over the period during which the Company has access to the land and the subsurface assets will be amortized based on utilization of available pore space. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes, tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022, we had tax valuation allowances totaling 59.2 million to reduce the carrying value of our state deferred tax assets. The valuation allowances will remain until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes our cumulative loss position, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. Significant judgment is involved in this determination as we are required to make assumptions about forecasted commodity prices and economics in the oil and gas industry that may impact our ability to generate future earnings. Such estimates are inherently subjective. Changes in judgment regarding future realization of deferred tax assets may result in a reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the period that determination is made, and our net income during that period would benefit from a lower effective tax rate. A 1 increase in our statutory tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense (benefit) by approximately 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Fair Value Estimates 
 
 The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements , to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our recurring fair value measurements. 
 
 Significant uses of fair value measurements include: 
 
 valuation of the Company s assets, liabilities and equity upon application of fresh start accounting (see Fresh Start Accounting above); 
 allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions; 
 assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; and 
 recorded value of commodity derivative instruments. 
 
 Impairment Assessment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 We test long-lived assets that are not subject to our quarterly full cost pool ceiling test for impairment, including a portion of our capitalized CO 2 properties and pipelines, CCUS storage sites and related costs, and long-term contracts to sell CO 2 to industrial customers, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The factors we assess to determine if a long-lived asset impairment test is necessary include, among other factors, a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset (asset group) is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset (asset group). 
 
 We perform our long-lived asset impairment test by comparing the net carrying costs of our long-lived asset groups to the respective expected future undiscounted net cash flows that are supported by these long-lived assets which include production of our probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves and future CCUS revenues. If the undiscounted net cash flows are below the net carrying costs for an asset group, we must record an impairment loss by the amount, if any, that net carrying costs exceed the fair value of the long-lived asset group. Significant assumptions impacting expected future oil and gas undiscounted net cash flows include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO 2 , projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves and risk-adjustment factors applied to the cash flows. Significant assumptions impacting expected future CCUS undiscounted net cash flows include projection of future CO 2 volumes available for transportation and storage and the development and operating costs of our storage sites. We performed a qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2022 and determined there were no material changes to our key cash flow assumptions and no triggering events since September 18, 2020 when the Company s assets were revalued in fresh start accounting; therefore, no impairment test was performed for the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 
 Commodity Derivative Contracts 
 
 Historically, we have entered into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production and to provide more certainty to our future cash flows. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Generally, these contracts have consisted of various combinations of price floors, collars, three-way collars, fixed-price swaps, fixed-price swaps enhanced with a sold put, and basis swaps. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The valuation methods used to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates, such as forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors and credit worthiness, as well as other relevant economic measures. We do not apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative contracts under the FASC Derivatives and Hedging

topic; accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings. While we may experience more volatility in our net income (loss) than if we were to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic, we believe that for us, the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting. We estimate that a 10 increase in NYMEX oil futures prices as of December 31, 2022 would increase our estimated payments on our crude oil derivative contracts by 35 million, and a 10 decrease in NYMEX oil futures prices would reduce our estimated payments by 36 million. 
 
 Fresh Start Accounting 
 
 Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we met the criteria and were required to adopt fresh start accounting in accordance with FASC Topic 852, Reorganizations , which on the Emergence Date resulted in a new entity, the Successor, for financial reporting purposes, with no beginning retained earnings or deficit as of the fresh start reporting date. Fresh start accounting requires that new fair values be established for the Company s assets, liabilities and equity as of the date of emergence from bankruptcy, September 18, 2020. The Emergence Date fair values of the Successor s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheet of the Predecessor and required a number of estimates and judgments to be made. All estimates, assumptions, valuations and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, financial projections, enterprise value and equity value, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, valuations or financial projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.

 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Denbury Inc. and its subsidiaries (Successor) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, and for the period from September 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, and for the period from September 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis of Accounting 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas confirmed the Company s prepackaged joint plan of reorganization the plan on September 2, 2020. Confirmation of the plan resulted in the discharge of all claims against the Company that arose before July 30, 2020 and terminates all rights and interests of equity security holders as provided for in the plan. The plan was substantially consummated on September 18, 2020 and the Company emerged from bankruptcy. In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting as of September 18, 2020. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

64 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 The Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Net Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
 The Company s net property and equipment balance, which includes net proved oil and natural gas properties, was 1,931.7 million as of December 31, 2022, and depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD A) expense was 151.4 million. As described in Note 1, the Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs related to the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized and accumulated into a single cost center. The costs capitalized, including production equipment and future development costs, are depleted or depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including future production rates, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. Net proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates are determined by the Company s internal reservoir engineering team and independent petroleum engineers (collectively specialists ). 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on net proved oil and natural gas properties is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the assumptions applied to the depletion, depreciation and amortization calculation related to future production rates. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves, and the depletion, depreciation and amortization calculation. The work of management s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved oil 
 
 65 

and natural gas reserves and the reasonableness of the future production rates applied in the depletion, depreciation and amortization calculation. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the company s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists, and an evaluation of the specialists findings.

 During the Predecessor period, the Company applied Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification FASC Topic 852, Reorganizations, in preparing the consolidated financial statements. FASC Topic 852 requires the financial statements, for periods subsequent to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Restructuring, to distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain charges incurred during 2020 related to the Chapter 11 Restructuring, including the write-off of unamortized long-term debt fees and discounts associated with debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise, and professional fees incurred directly as a result of the Chapter 11 Restructuring. Such charges are recorded as Reorganization items, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Predecessor period. FASC Topic 852 requires certain additional reporting for financial statements prepared between the bankruptcy filing date and the date of emergence from bankruptcy, including segregation of Reorganization items, net as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.

operating segment. Management measures financial performance for the Company as a whole and, at this time, does not assess performance of oil and gas operations separately from our emerging CCUS business. While we have been actively engaged in pursuing emerging CCUS business activities as a natural extension of our historic CO 2 EOR operations and CO 2 pipeline infrastructure, to date we do not have revenues associated with capturing, transporting and sequestering CO 2 
 
 We have recorded million of CCUS assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and incurred million of CCUS capital expenditures on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, most of which is attributable to the development of CO 2 storage sites for future sequestration of captured industrial emissions.

million of our unevaluated costs to the full cost pool during the Predecessor period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting which resulted in our oil and natural gas properties, including unevaluated properties, being recorded at their fair values at the Emergence Date (see Note 2, Fresh Start Accounting ). 
 
 Write-Down of Oil and Natural Gas Properties. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10 ), based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during a 12-month rolling period prior to the end of a particular reporting period; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects. Our future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO 2 reserves nor those related to the cost of constructing CO 2 pipelines, as we do not have to incur additional CO 2 capital costs to develop the proved oil and natural gas reserves. Therefore, we include in the ceiling test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO 2 costs related to CO 2 reserves and CO 2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly. 
 
 The average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, was at December 31, 2022, at December 31, 2021, at December 31, 2020, and at September 18, 2020. We did not recognize a full cost pool ceiling test write-down during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a million full cost pool ceiling test write-down primarily as a result of the March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures which was recorded based on a valuation that utilized NYMEX strip oil prices at the acquisition date, which were significantly higher than the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices used to value the cost ceiling. Primarily as a result of the commodity price declines during 2020, the Predecessor recognized full cost pool ceiling test write-downs of million during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, and an additional full cost pool ceiling test write-down of million was recognized during the Successor period from September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020. 
 
 Joint Interest Operations. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are conducted jointly with others.

Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and regulations for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO 2 injection, until we can demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood. 
 
 We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO 2 injections (i.e., a production response). These capitalized development costs are included in our unevaluated property costs until we are able to recognize proved reserves associated with the development

 billion and billion, with a midpoint of billion. For U.S. GAAP purposes, we valued the Successor s individual assets, liabilities, and equity instruments and determined the value of the enterprise was approximately billion as of the Emergence Date, which fell in line with the midpoint of the forecast enterprise value ranges approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Specific valuation approaches and key assumptions used to arrive at reorganization value, and the value of discrete assets and liabilities resulting from the application of fresh start accounting, are described below in greater detail within the valuation process.

 The following table reconciles enterprise value to reorganization value of the Successor (i.e., value of the reconstituted entity) and total reorganization value: 
 In thousands Sept. 18, 2020 Enterprise value Plus: Cash and cash equivalents Plus: Current liabilities excluding current maturities of long-term debt Plus: Non-interest-bearing noncurrent liabilities Reorganization value of the reconstituted Successor 
 
 With the assistance of third-party valuation advisors, we determined the enterprise and corresponding equity value of the Successor using various valuation approaches and methods, including: (i) income approach using a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our financial projections, (ii) the market approach using selling prices of similar assets and (iii) the cost approach. 
 
 The enterprise value and corresponding equity value are dependent upon achieving the future financial results set forth in our valuation using an asset-based methodology of estimated proved reserves, undeveloped properties, and other financial information, considerations and projections, applying a combination of the income, cost and market approaches as of the fresh start reporting date of September 18, 2020. All estimates, assumptions, valuations and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, the financial projections, the enterprise value and equity value projections, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, valuations or financial projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.

 Valuation Process Upon Emergence 
 
 The fair values of our principal assets, including oil and natural gas properties, CO 2 properties, pipelines, other property and equipment, long-term contracts to sell CO 2 to industrial customers, favorable and unfavorable vendor contracts, pipeline financing liabilities and right-of-use assets, asset retirement obligations and warrants were estimated as of the Emergence Date. 
 
 Oil and Natural Gas Properties 
 
 The Company s principal assets are its oil and natural gas properties, which are accounted for under the full cost accounting method as described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Oil and Natural Gas Properties . The Company determined the fair value of its oil and gas properties based on the discounted cash flows expected to be generated from these assets. The computations were based on market conditions and reserves in place as of the Emergence Date. 
 
 The fair value analysis was based on the Company s estimated future production rates of proved and probable reserves as prepared by the Company s independent petroleum engineers. Discounted cash flow models were prepared using the estimated future revenues and operating costs for all developed wells and undeveloped properties comprising the proved and probable reserves. Future revenues were based upon future production rates and forward strip oil and natural gas prices as of the Emergence Date through 2024 and escalated for inflation thereafter, adjusted for differentials. Operating costs were adjusted for inflation beginning in year 2025. A risk adjustment factor was applied to each reserve category, consistent with the risk of the category. The discounted cash flow models also included adjustments for income tax expenses. 
 
 Discount factors utilized were derived using a weighted average cost of capital computation, which included an estimated cost of debt and equity for market participants with similar geographies and asset development type and varying corporate income tax rates based on the expected point of sale for each property s produced assets. Reserve values were also adjusted for any asset retirement obligations as well as for CO 2 indirect costs not directly allocable to oil fields. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded the fair value of its proved and probable reserves was million as of the Emergence Date (see footnote 10 to Fresh Start Adjustments discussion below).

The time to maturity of the warrants was based on the contractual terms of the warrants of five and for series A and series B warrants, respectively. The values were also adjusted for potential dilution impacts.

 Liabilities assumed relate to our March 2021 acquisition of Wyoming property interests (see Note 3, Acquisition and Divestitures ), and liabilities incurred generally relate to wells and facilities.

 Senior Secured Bank Credit Facility 
 
 On September 18, 2020, we entered into a million credit agreement for a senior secured revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (as amended, the Bank Credit Agreement ). Under the Bank Credit Agreement, letters of credit are available in an aggregate amount not to exceed million, and short-term swingline loans are available in an aggregate amount not to exceed million, each subject to the available commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement. Availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which is redetermined semiannually on or around May 1 and November 1 of each year. The borrowing base is adjusted at the lenders discretion and is based, in part, upon external factors over which we have no control. If our outstanding debt under the Bank Credit Agreement exceeds the then-effective borrowing base, we would be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed six months. The undrawn portion of the aggregate lender commitments under the Bank Credit Agreement is subject to a commitment fee of per annum. Our outstanding borrowings under the Bank Credit Agreement, totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and as of December 31, 2022, we had million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 
 On May 4, 2022, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement, which among other things: 
 
 Increased the borrowing base and lender commitments from million to million; 
 Extended the maturity date from January 30, 2024 to May 4, 2027; 
 Modified the interest provisions on loans under the Bank Credit Agreement to (1) reduce the applicable margin for alternate base rate loans from to per annum to to per annum and (2) replace provisions referencing LIBOR loans with Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) loans, with an applicable margin of to per annum; and 
 Permitted us to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock and make other unlimited restricted payments and investments so long as (1) no event of default or borrowing base deficiency exists; (2) our total leverage ratio is to 1 or lower; and (3) availability under the Bank Credit Agreement is at least of the borrowing base. 
 
 As part of our Fall 2022 semiannual borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base and lender commitments for our Bank Credit Agreement were reaffirmed at million, with our next scheduled redetermination around May 1, 2023. 
 
 On January 20, 2023, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Bank Credit Agreement, which among other things, provides us the ability to make and repay certain SOFR loan borrowings on a weekly basis. 
 
 The Bank Credit Agreement limits our ability to, among other things, incur and repay other indebtedness; grant liens; engage in certain mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; engage in sales of assets; make acquisitions and investments; make other restricted payments (including redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our common stock); and enter into commodity derivative agreements, in each case subject to certain exceptions to such limitations, as specified in the Bank Credit

 A requirement to maintain a current ratio (i.e., Consolidated Current Assets to Consolidated Current Liabilities) of . 
 
 For purposes of computing the current ratio per the Bank Credit Agreement, Consolidated Current Assets exclude the current portion of derivative assets but include available borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement, and Consolidated Current Liabilities exclude the current portion of derivative liabilities as well as the current portions of long-term indebtedness outstanding. 
 
 The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 under the Bank Credit Agreement was . As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Bank Credit Agreement. 
 
 The above description of our Bank Credit Agreement and defined terms are contained in the Bank Credit Agreement. 
 
 Restructuring of Pipeline Financing Transactions 
 
 In May 2008, we closed two transactions with Genesis Energy, L.P. Genesis involving two of our pipelines. The NEJD pipeline system included a -year secured financing lease, and the Free State Pipeline included a long-term transportation service agreement. In late October 2020, we restructured our CO 2 pipeline financing arrangements with Genesis, whereby (1) Denbury reacquired the NEJD pipeline system from Genesis in exchange for million which was paid in four equal payments during 2021, representing full settlement of all remaining obligations under the NEJD secured financing lease; and (2) Denbury reacquired the Free State Pipeline from Genesis in exchange for a one-time payment of million on October 30, 2020. 
 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 
 In connection with the issuance of our outstanding long-term debt, we have incurred debt issuance costs, which are being amortized to interest expense using the straight line or effective interest method over the term of each related facility or borrowing. Remaining unamortized debt issuance costs were million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Issuance costs associated with our Bank Credit Agreement are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 At December 31, 2022, we had general business credit carryforwards totaling million that begin to expire in 2041. In connection with our restructuring in 2020, net operating loss carryforwards NOLs ), and tax credit carryforwards for enhanced oil recovery and research and development generated prior to January 1, 2021 were fully reduced in accordance with the attribute reduction and ordering rules of Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 pertaining to discharge of indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had million of alternative minimum tax credits, which under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed in 2017 are fully refundable and are recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet, and state NOLs and tax credits totaling million (before provision for valuation allowance) related to our state operations. Our state NOLs expire in various years, starting in 2025. 
 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the available tax carryforwards and the temporary differences based on tax laws and statutory rates in effect at the December 31, 2022 and 2021 balance sheet dates. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, we reached a determination as of March 31, 2022, that there was sufficient positive evidence, primarily related to a substantial increase in worldwide oil prices and taxable income generated from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, to conclude that our federal and certain state deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Based on this determination, in 2022 we reversed the valuation allowance on our federal and certain state deferred tax assets by million and million, respectively. The reversal of state valuation allowance relates to certain state deferred tax assets for Mississippi, Montana and North Dakota. As of December 31, 2022, we had million of net state deferred tax assets associated with operations in Louisiana, Alabama, as well as certain Mississippi tax credits, which were fully offset with valuation allowances. The valuation allowances will remain until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to become utilized.

 of an employee s contribution, up to of compensation, as defined by the plan, which is vested immediately. Matching contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled million during 2022, million during 2021, million for the period September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (Successor), and million for the period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020 (Predecessor). 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 In early May 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a common share repurchase program for up to million of outstanding Denbury common stock. During June and July 2022, the Company repurchased shares of Denbury common stock under this program for approximately million, at an average price of per share. In August 2022, the Board increased Denbury s stock repurchase authorization by million, thus a total of million of common stock currently remains authorized for future repurchases under this program. The program has no pre-established ending date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of its common stock under the program. 
 
 Retirement of Treasury Stock 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we retired million shares of existing treasury stock, with a carrying value of million, acquired primarily through our stock repurchase program. Upon the retirement of treasury stock, we reduce common stock by the par value of common stock retired, and we reduce additional paid-in capital by the value of those shares in excess of par value. 
 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Successor 
 
 On June 1, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved the Denbury Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizing the sale of up to shares of common stock thereunder. In accordance with the ESPP, full-time employees may contribute up to of their base salary, subject to certain limitations, to purchase previously unissued Denbury common stock. Participants in the ESPP may purchase common stock at a discount to the fair market value of a share of common stock determined as the lower of the closing sales price on the first or last trading day of each offering period. The first offering period under the ESPP commenced on September 1, 2022 and ended on December 31, 2022 for which the Company issued shares. The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

 Management Incentive Plan Successor 
 
 In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, the Plan provided for the adoption of a management incentive plan, the Denbury Inc. 2020 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the LTIP ), effective as of the Emergence Date, through an amendment and restatement of the Denbury Resources Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of March 26, 2020. The LTIP reserved million shares of Denbury s common stock for awards to officers, other employees, directors and other service providers. The LTIP provides for, among other things, the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, cash awards, or any combination of the foregoing. On December 2, 2020, Denbury s board of directors approved and ratified the LTIP, with initial awards covering million shares of common stock granted on December 4, 2020. As of December 31, 2022, million shares were available for future grants under the LTIP, all of which could be issued in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance stock units. Our incentive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. The LTIP will expire September 2030. 
 
 period with delivery of the shares occurring at the end of the three-year period. Vested non-performance-based RSU awards provide the holders with dividend equivalent rights payable upon settlement of the underlying RSU awards. Shares to be delivered to participants are expected to be made available from authorized but unissued shares reserved under the LTIP. The grant-date fair value of the RSUs is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
 
 Holders of non-performance-based restricted stock awards have the rights of owning non-restricted stock (including voting rights) except that the holders are not entitled to delivery of a portion thereof until certain requirements are met. Non- 
 performance-based restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three-year period, with the specific terms of vesting determined at the time of grant and delivery of the shares occurring upon vesting. Non-performance-based restricted stock awards provide the holders with forfeitable dividend equivalent rights which vests with the underlying shares. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the Successor s non-performance-based restricted stock unit grants and restricted stock awards, respectively. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years and years, respectively.

 Performance-Based Stock Units Successor 
 
 In December 2020 and March 2022, the Successor Board of Directors granted performance stock unit PSU awards to a limited number of employees. The PSU awards granted in December 2020 had vesting parameters tied to the Company s common stock trading prices and became fully vested on March 3, 2021. Although the performance measures for vesting of these awards have been achieved, delivery of the shares will not occur until the conclusion of the performance period, December 4, 2023. The PSU awards granted in March 2022 vest over approximately years and the number of performance-based awards earned (and eligible to vest) during the performance period will depend upon the performance of our stock relative to that of a designated peer group. Generally, one-half of the maximum number of shares that could be earned under the performance-based awards will be earned for performance at the designated target levels target vesting levels) 
 or upon any earlier change of control, and twice the target number of shares will be earned if the maximum target levels are met of target vesting levels). The shares earned will be issued upon vesting of the award on March 1, 2025. Vested performance-based PSU awards provide the holders with dividend equivalent rights payable upon settlement of the underlying PSU awards. Shares to be delivered to participants are expected to be made available from authorized but unissued shares reserved under the LTIP. 

As of December 31, 2022, there was million of remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the Successor s PSU awards. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

 June 2020 Compensation Adjustments Predecessor 
 
 In response to the then ongoing significant economic and market uncertainty affecting the oil and gas industry, in June 2020 the Predecessor and its Board of Directors and Compensation Committee implemented a revised compensation structure under which for of the Company s executives (including our named executive officers) and senior managers, all outstanding equity awards and 2020 targeted variable cash-based compensation were canceled and replaced with a cash retention incentive. In total, million in cash retention incentives were prepaid to those employees in June 2020, with an obligation of the 
 executives to repay up to of the compensation (on an after-tax basis) if specified conditions were not satisfied. The Predecessor s named executive officers cash retention incentives were earned based on their continued employment for a period of up to 12 months and based on achieving certain specified incentive metrics. 
 
 In accordance with FASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , we accounted for the transaction involving equity compensation as an award modification and reclassified the awards from equity to liability awards. As a result of the modification of the awards, unrecognized compensation at the time of modification was determined to be million million of incremental compensation expense), which was higher than the million cash payment, and was calculated as the greater of (i) grant date fair value of the previously-outstanding awards plus incremental compensation (defined as cash paid related to the cash retention incentive in excess of the modification date fair value of the previously-existing awards) or (ii) cash paid for the cash retention incentive for each award. The value was recognized as total compensation expense for each award over the service period. The compensation expense was recognized in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020 (Predecessor). The accounting for the Predecessor s remaining share-based compensation awards continued throughout the period covered by the Chapter 11 Restructuring, and upon cancellation of the awards, an additional million of compensation expense was recognized during the Predecessor period ended September 18, 2020. 
 
 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan Predecessor 
 
 The Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of March 26, 2020 (the 2004 Plan ), was an incentive plan that provided for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights settled in stock, and performance-based awards to officers, employees and directors. Since the 2004 Plan s inception, awards covering a total of million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2004 Plan. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, all outstanding equity as of September 18, 2020 was cancelled.

 Other Fair Value Measurements 
 
 The carrying value of our loans under our Bank Credit Agreement approximate fair value, as they are subject to short-term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to us for those periods. The estimated fair value of the principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was million and million, respectively. We have other financial instruments consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury notes, short-term receivables and payables that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and the relatively short maturities. 

years. The price we will pay for CO 2 generally varies depending on the amount of CO 2 delivered and the price of oil. In addition, we have a processing fee contract related to our overriding royalty interest in the CO 2 at LaBarge Field. Our annual commitment under these contracts could range from million to million in 2023, assuming a per Bbl NYMEX oil price and declines in future years as the CO 2 purchase contract commitments expire. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a CO 2 storage agreement that included two non-cancellable payments of million, totaling million, due in 2023 and 2024.

 Litigation 
 
 We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. We accrue for losses from litigation and claims if we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 On May 26, 2022, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA of the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order NOPV relating to the February 2020 pipeline failure near Satartia, Mississippi in our CO 2 pipeline running between the Tinsley and Delhi fields. The NOPV proposed a preliminarily assessed civil penalty of million in connection with the incident, which we recorded in our second quarter of 2022 financial statements. We have responded to the NOPV and are pursuing discussions with PHMSA regarding the probable violations alleged in the NOPV, the proposed civil penalty, and the nature of the compliance order contained in the NOPV. 
 
 Other Contingencies 
 
 We are subject to audits for various taxes (income, sales and use, and severance) in the various states in which we operate, and from time to time receive assessments for potential taxes that we may owe. In the past, settlement of these matters has not had a material adverse financial impact on us, and currently we have material assessments for potential taxes. 
 
 We are subject to various possible contingencies that arise primarily from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry. Such contingencies include differing interpretations as to the prices at which oil and natural gas sales may be made, the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Although we believe that we have complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations thereof, adjustments could be required as new interpretations and regulations are issued. In addition, production rates, marketing and environmental matters are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND NATURAL GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED) 
 
 Costs Incurred 
 
 The following table summarizes costs incurred and capitalized in oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Property acquisition costs are those costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire property, including both undeveloped leasehold and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that may warrant examination and examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells, geological and geophysical costs, and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling development wells, and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and natural gas, and the cost of improved recovery systems. 
 
 We capitalize interest on unevaluated oil and natural gas properties that have ongoing development activities. Included in costs incurred in the table below is capitalized interest of 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 4.3 million for year ended December 31, 2021, 1.2 million for the period September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and 22.0 million for the period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. Costs incurred include asset retirement obligations incurred and acquired. Asset retirement obligations included in the table below were 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, 3.4 million for the period September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and 2.5 million for the period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020. See Note 6, Asset Retirement Obligations , for additional information. 
 
 Costs incurred in oil and natural gas activities were as follows:

 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 
 Net proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates for all years presented were prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas. These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. See Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves below for a discussion of the effect of the different prices on reserve quantities and values. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes, and future development costs were based on current costs as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The following reserves data represents estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. Moreover, the present values should not be construed as the current market value of our oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves. Estimates of reserves as of year-end 2022, 2021 and 2020 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the applicable fiscal 12-month period. All of our reserves are located in the United States.

 Revisions of previous estimates reflect changes in commodity prices resulting in upward revisions of 23.1 MMBOE and 50.1 MMBOE during 2022 and 2021, respectively and downward revisions of 75.7 MMBOE during 2020. 
 
 There were no significant additions, excluding acquisitions of minerals in place in 2021, to our oil and natural gas reserves, as the magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year depends on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response, and we initiated no new floods in 2021 or 2020. During 2022, we initiated a new tertiary flood at CCA but have not yet recognized proved reserves associated with this project. Acquisition of minerals in place during 2021 were related to our Wind River Basin acquisition. 
 
 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 
 The Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Standardized Measure does not purport to present the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. An estimate of such value should consider, among other factors, anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas, the probability of recoveries in excess of existing proved reserves, the value of probable reserves and acreage prospects, and perhaps different discount rates. It should be noted that estimates of reserves quantities, especially from new discoveries, are inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. 
 
 Under the Standardized Measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying a first-day-of-the-month 12-month average price (as shown in the table below) to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves. These prices have a significant impact on both the quantities and value of the proved reserves, as reductions in oil and natural gas prices can cause wells to reach the end of their economic life much sooner and can make certain proved undeveloped locations uneconomical, both of which reduce the reserves. These prices were further adjusted by field to arrive at the appropriate corporate net price. 
 December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Oil (NYMEX price per Bbl) 93.67 66.56 39.57 Natural Gas (Henry Hub price per MMBtu) 6.36 3.60 1.99 
 
 The changes in the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows in the tables that follow were significantly impacted by the movement in first-day-of-the-month average NYMEX oil prices between 2020 and 2022. The weighted average oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential) utilized were 0.65 per Bbl

 Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future production, development and abandonment costs based on current cost, with no escalation to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Our future net inflows do not include a reduction for cash previously expended on our capitalized CO 2 assets that will be consumed in the production of proved tertiary reserves. Future income taxes were computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of net cash inflows over our tax basis in the associated proved oil and natural gas properties. Tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards were also considered in the future income tax calculation. Future net cash inflows after income taxes were discounted using a 10 annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022, to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded; that it is processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and that information that is required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have determined that, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in the report that appears herein. 
 
 Important Considerations 
 
 The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.

 EXHIBIT 4(D) DESCRIPTION OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Document 

Exhibit 4(d) 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 
 General 
 
 The following is a summary of the key terms and provisions of our equity securities. You should refer to the applicable provisions of our Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law for a complete statement of the terms and rights of our capital stock. 
 
 Authorized Capital Stock 
 
 In accordance with our certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of stock, including up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value .001 per share, and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value .001 per share. 
 
 Common Stock 
 
 Voting rights . Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of preferred stock pursuant to applicable law or the provision of the certificate of designation creating that series, all voting rights are vested in the holders of shares of common stock. Holders of shares of common stock have non-cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect 100 of the directors, and the holders of the remaining shares voting for the election of directors will not be able to elect any directors. 
 
 Dividends . Dividends may be paid to holders of common stock when, as and if declared by the board of directors (the Board out of funds legally available for their payment, subject to the rights of holders of any preferred stock. We have not paid dividends on our common stock since emerging from bankruptcy, and have no current plans to declare common stock dividends. 
 
 Rights upon liquidation . In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock will be entitled to share equally, in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them, in any of our assets available for distribution after the payment in full of all debts and distributions and after holders of all series of outstanding preferred stock, if any, have received their liquidation preferences in full. 
 
 Non-assessable . All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. 
 
 Other rights and preferences . Holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive, conversion or exchange rights. Our common stock has no sinking fund or redemption provisions. Holders of common stock may act by unanimous written consent. 
 
 Listing . Our outstanding shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol DEN. 
 
 Preferred Stock 
 
 The following description of the terms of the preferred stock sets forth certain general terms and provisions of our authorized preferred stock. If we offer preferred stock, a description will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the specific designations and rights, as determined by the Board, will be described in such filing, including the following terms 
 
 the series, the number of shares offered and the liquidation value of the preferred stock 
 the price at which the preferred stock will be issued 
 the dividend rate, the dates on which the dividends will be payable and other terms relating to the payment of dividends on the preferred stock 
 the liquidation preference of the preferred stock 
 the voting rights of the preferred stock, if any 

whether the preferred stock is redeemable or subject to a sinking fund, and the terms of any such redemption or sinking fund 
 whether the preferred stock is convertible or exchangeable for any other securities, and the terms of any such conversion and 
 any additional rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the preferred stock. 
 
 Except where otherwise set forth in a resolution of the Board providing for the issuance of any series of preferred stock, the number of shares comprising such series may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding) from time to time by like action of the Board. The shares of preferred stock of any one series shall be identical with the other shares in the same series in all respects except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall cumulate, if cumulative. 
 
 The description of the terms of the preferred stock to be set forth in the applicable filing will not be complete and will be subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the certificate of designation relating to the applicable series of preferred stock. 
 
 Undesignated preferred stock may enable the Board to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or otherwise, and to thereby protect the continuity of our management. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. For example, any preferred stock issued may rank prior to our common stock as to dividend rights, liquidation preference or both, may have full or limited voting rights and may be convertible into shares of common stock. As a result, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may discourage bids for our common stock or may otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock or any existing preferred stock. 
 
 Any preferred stock will, when issued, be fully paid and non-assessable. 
 
 Warrants 
 
 Upon emerging from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020, the Company entered into Warrant Agreements with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as warrant agent, which provides for Denbury s issuance of up to an aggregate of (i) 2,631,579 Series A Warrants to purchase Denbury Inc. common stock, par value 0.001 per share, initially exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of 32.59 per share and (ii) 2,894,740 Series B Warrants to purchase Denbury Inc. common stock, par value 0.001 per share, initially exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of 35.41 per share. 
 
 Exercisability . The Series A Warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance until 5 00 p.m., New York time, on September 18, 2025, at which time all unexercised Series A Warrants will expire and the rights of the holders of such Series A Warrants to purchase New Common Stock will terminate. The Series B Warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance until 5 00 p.m., New York time, on September 18, 2023, at which time all unexercised Series B Warrants will expire and the rights of the holders of such Series B Warrants to purchase New Common Stock will terminate. 
 
 Outstanding Warrants . As of December 31, 2022, 1,782,221 Series A warrants were outstanding, each exercisable for one share of the Company s Common Stock and 1,460,643 Series B warrants were outstanding, each exercisable for one share of the Company s Common Stock. 
 
 Pursuant to the Warrant Agreements, no holder of a Warrant, by virtue of holding or having a beneficial interest in a Warrant, will have the right to vote, receive dividends, receive notice as stockholders with respect to any meeting of stockholders for the election of Denbury s directors or any other matter, or exercise any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of Denbury unless, until and only to the extent such holders become holders of record of shares of Denbury Inc. issued upon settlement of Warrants. 
 
 The number of shares of New Common Stock for which a Warrant is exercisable, and the Exercise Prices, are subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including (1) stock splits, reverse stock splits or stock dividends to holders of New Common Stock or (2) a reclassification in respect of New Common Stock.

 Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
 Pursuant to your request, this report of third party presents an independent evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, of the extent and value of the estimated net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves of certain properties in which Denbury Inc. (Denbury) has represented it holds an interest. This evaluation was completed on February 1, 2023. The properties evaluated herein consist of working and royalty interests located in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. Denbury has represented that these properties account for 100 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Denbury s net proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. The net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Denbury. 
 
 Estimates of proved carbon dioxide reserves are also included herein. While Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC do not allow the reporting of carbon dioxide reserves, at Denbury s request carbon dioxide reserves were evaluated using the technical and economic criteria of the SEC for petroleum reserves. 
 
 Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after December 31, 2022. Certain of the properties evaluated herein in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming are subject to net profit interest (NPI) payable to other parties. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests held by Denbury after deducting all interests held by others and after accounting for the portion of the gross reserves attributable to the NPI owners. 
 
 Values for proved reserves in this report are expressed in terms of future gross revenue, future net revenue, and present worth. Future gross revenue is defined as that revenue which will accrue to the evaluated interests from the production and sale of the estimated net reserves. Future net revenue is calculated by deducting NPI payments, production and ad valorem taxes, operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment costs from future gross revenue. Operating expenses include field operating expenses, transportation and processing expenses, compression charges, and an allocation of overhead that directly relates to production activities. Capital costs include drilling and completion costs, facilities costs, and field maintenance costs. Abandonment costs are represented by Denbury to be inclusive of those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment. At the request of Denbury, future income taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. Present worth is defined as future net revenue discounted at a nominal discount rate of 10 percent per year compounded monthly over the expected period of realization. Present worth should not be construed as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought and sold. 
 
 Estimates of reserves and revenue should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information. 
 
 Information used in the preparation of this report was obtained from Denbury and from public sources. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon information furnished by Denbury with respect to the property interests being evaluated, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current 

prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. 
 
 Definition of Reserves 
 
 Petroleum reserves included in this report are classified as proved. Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 

(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in section 210.4-10 (a) Definitions , or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 
 
 Methodology and Procedures 
 
 Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC and with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019) Approved by the SPE Board on 25 June 2019. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. 
 
 Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Denbury, and analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved. 
 
 The proved undeveloped reserves estimates were based on opportunities identified in the plan of development provided by Denbury. 
 
 Denbury has represented that its senior management is committed to the development plan provided by Denbury and that Denbury has the financial capability to execute the development plan, including the drilling and completion of wells and the installation of equipment and facilities. 
 
 When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP) and original gas in place (OGIP). Structure maps were prepared to delineate each reservoir, and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation. When adequate data were available and when circumstances justified, material-balance methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP. 
 
 Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP and OGIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate recovery factors based on an analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and reservoir fluid properties. Certain properties evaluated herein are produced using carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery methods involving continuous carbon dioxide flooding operations. Therefore, carbon dioxide versus oil ratios and carbon dioxide injection volumes were analyzed and projected and were used in the estimation of reserves when applicable. 
 
 For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance 

relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production as defined under the Definition of Reserves heading of this report. 
 
 In certain cases, reserves were estimated by incorporating elements of analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available. 
 
 In the evaluation of undeveloped reserves, type-well analysis was performed using well data from analogous reservoirs for which more complete historical performance data were available. 
 
 Data provided by Denbury from wells drilled through November 30, 2022, and made available for this evaluation were used to prepare the reserves estimates herein. These reserves estimates were based on consideration of monthly production data available for certain properties only through November 2022. Estimated cumulative production, as of December 31, 2022, was deducted from the estimated gross ultimate recovery to estimate gross reserves. This required that production be estimated for 1 month. 
 
 Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are to be recovered by normal field separation. NGL reserves estimated herein include pentanes and heavier fractions (C 5+ and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which consists primarily of propane and butane fractions and are the result of low-temperature plant processing. Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves included in this report are expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl). In these estimates, 1 barrel equals 42 United States gallons. For reporting purposes, oil, condensate, and NGL reserves have been estimated separately and are presented herein as a summed quantity. 
 
 Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel usage, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing. Gas reserves estimated herein are reported as sales gas. Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit F) and at the pressure base of the state in which the quantities are located. Gas quantities included in this report are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMcf). 
 
 Gas quantities are identified by the type of reservoir from which the gas will be produced. Nonassociated gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions with no oil present in the reservoir. Associated gas is both gas-cap gas and solution gas. Gas-cap gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions and is in communication with an underlying oil zone. Solution gas is gas dissolved in oil at initial reservoir conditions. Gas quantities estimated herein include both associated and nonassociated gas. 
 
 At the request of Denbury, sales gas reserves estimated herein were converted to oil equivalent using an energy equivalent factor of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per 1 barrel of oil equivalent. 
 
 Primary Economic Assumptions 
 
 Revenue values in this report were estimated using initial prices, expenses, and costs provided by Denbury. Future prices were estimated using guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The following economic assumptions were used for estimating the revenue values reported herein 
 
 Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices 
 
 Denbury has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. Denbury supplied differentials to the NYMEX reference price of 93.67 per barrel and the prices were held constant thereafter. The pre-NPI volume-weighted average prices attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the properties were 93.02 per barrel of oil and condensate and 52.55 per barrel of NGL. 
 
 Gas Prices 
 
 Denbury has represented that the gas prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. Denbury supplied differentials to the NYMEX gas reference price of 6.357 per million Btu and the prices were held constant thereafter. Btu factors provided by Denbury were used to convert prices from dollars per million Btu to dollars per thousand cubic feet. 

The pre-NPI volume-weighted average price attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the properties was 5.081 per thousand cubic feet of gas. 
 
 Production and Ad Valorem Taxes 
 
 Production taxes were calculated using rates provided by Denbury, including, where appropriate, abatements for enhanced recovery programs. Ad valorem taxes were calculated using rates provided by Denbury based on recent payments. 
 
 Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs 
 
 Estimates of operating expenses and future capital expenditures, provided by Denbury and based on existing economic conditions, were held constant for the lives of the properties. In certain cases, future expenditures, either higher or lower than current expenditures, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions, but no general escalation that might result from inflation was applied. Abandonment costs, which are those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment, were provided by Denbury and were not adjusted for inflation. The abandonment costs were provided by Denbury at the field level (and the well level where appropriate). These abandonment costs have not been allocated to the various individual properties within each field. Operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment costs were considered, as appropriate, in determining the economic viability of the undeveloped reserves estimated herein. 
 
 In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves, estimated future net revenue from proved reserves, and present worth of estimated future net revenue from proved reserves of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, 932-235-50-9, 932-235-50-30, and 932-235-50-31(a), (b), and (e) of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the FASB and Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC provided, however, that (i) future income tax expenses have not been taken into account in estimating the future net revenue and present worth values set forth herein, (ii) estimates of the proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year, and (iii) the reporting of carbon dioxide reserves is not permitted under SEC regulations. 
 
 To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor. 
 
 Summary of Conclusions 
 
 DeGolyer and MacNaughton has performed an independent evaluation of the extent and value of the estimated net proved oil, condensate, NGL, and gas reserves of certain properties in which Denbury has represented it holds an interest. The estimated net proved reserves, as of December 31, 2022, of the properties evaluated herein were based on the definition of proved reserves of the SEC and are summarized as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe)

 In addition to the gas reserves shown in the foregoing tabulation, Denbury s net proved carbon dioxide gas reserves in Mississippi and Wyoming, as of December 31, 2022, were estimated to be 4,035,949 MMcf. Denbury s proved developed carbon dioxide gas reserves attributable to its working interest were estimated to be 3,736,755 MMcf. The gross proved carbon dioxide reserves for the evaluated properties were estimated to be 6,797,425 MMcf. The proved developed carbon dioxide reserves estimated herein were prepared using the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Revenue associated with carbon dioxide reserves was not estimated in this report.
