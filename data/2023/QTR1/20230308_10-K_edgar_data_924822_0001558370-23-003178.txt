 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General Miller Industries is The World s Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment , with executive offices in Ooltewah, Tennessee, domestic manufacturing operations in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing operations in France and the United Kingdom. In 1990, we began developing or acquiring several of the most well-recognized brands in the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry. Since that time, our strategy has been to diversify our line of products and increase our presence in the industry through internal growth and development, although we remain open to opportunities for acquisitions of complementary products. In this Annual Report, the words Miller Industries, the Company, we, our, ours and us refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them. Towing and Recovery Equipment We offer a broad range of towing and recovery equipment products that meet most customer design, capacity and cost requirements. We manufacture the bodies of wreckers and car carriers, which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties. We frequently purchase the truck chassis for integration with our towing and recovery equipment and resale to our customers. Wreckers generally are used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with rotating hydraulic booms and up to 100-ton lifting capacities. Car carriers are specialized flatbed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective over longer distances. We also manufacture vehicle transport trailers. Our products primarily are sold through independent distributors that serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and other foreign markets including Europe, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, South America and Africa, and through prime contractors to governmental entities. Additionally, as a result of our ownership of Jige International S.A. in France and Boniface Engineering, Ltd. in the United Kingdom, we have substantial distribution capabilities in Europe. While most of our distributor agreements do not generally contain exclusivity provisions, management believes that more than 90 of our independent distributors do not offer products of any other towing and recovery equipment manufacturer, which we believe is a testament to their loyalty to our brands. In addition to selling our products to towing operators, our independent distributors provide them with parts and service. We also utilize sales representatives to inform prospective end-users about our current product lines in an effort to drive sales to independent distributors. Management believes the strength of our distribution network and the breadth and quality of our product offerings are two key advantages over our competitors. Product Lines We manufacture a broad line of wrecker, car carrier and trailer bodies to meet a full range of customer design, capacity and cost requirements. Wreckers. Wreckers are generally used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with up to 100-ton lifting capacities. Wreckers are available with specialized features, including underlifts, L-arms, crossbars and scoops, which lift disabled vehicles by the tires or front axle to minimize front end damage to the towed vehicles. Certain heavy-duty wrecker models offer rotating booms, which allow heavy-duty wreckers to recover vehicles from any angle, and remote-control devices for recovery equipment. In addition, certain light-duty wreckers are equipped with automatic wheel-lift hookup devices that allow operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the wrecker. Our wreckers range in capacity from 4 to 100 tons, and are classified as either light-duty or heavy-duty, with wreckers of 16-ton or greater capacity being classified as heavy-duty. Light-duty wreckers are used to remove vehicles from accident scenes and vehicles illegally parked, abandoned or disabled, and for general recovery. Heavy-duty wreckers are used in towing and recovery applications including overturned tractor trailers, buses, motor homes and other large vehicles.

 Car Carriers . Car carriers are specialized flat-bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers are used to transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective for transporting vehicles or other equipment over longer distances. In addition to transporting vehicles, car carriers may also be used for other purposes, including transportation of industrial equipment. Most professional towing operators have car carriers in their fleets to complement their towing capabilities. Transport Trailers . Our multi-vehicle transport trailers are specialized auto transport trailers with upper and lower decks and hydraulic ramps for loading vehicles. These trailers are used for moving multiple vehicles for auto auctions, car dealerships, leasing companies and other similar applications. These trailers are easy to load and transport 6 to 7 vehicles. The vehicles can be secured to transport quickly with ratchet and chain tie-downs that are mounted throughout the frame of the transport trailer. Many professional towing operators have added auto transport trailers to their fleets to add to their service offerings. Brand Names We manufacture and market our wreckers, car carriers and trailers under ten separate brand names. Although certain brands overlap in terms of features, prices and distributors, each brand has its own distinctive image and customer base. Century . The Century brand is our top-of-the-line brand and represents what management believes to be the broadest product line in the industry. The Century line was started in 1974 and produces wreckers ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 100-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers in lengths from 20 to 30 feet. Management believes that the Century brand has a reputation as the industry s leading product innovator. Vulcan . Our Vulcan product line includes a range of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers, ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 75-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers. Challenger . Our Challenger products compete with the Century and Vulcan products and constitute a third premium product line. Challenger products consist of heavy-duty wreckers with capacities ranging from 25 to 75 tons. The Challenger line was started in 1975 and is known for high-performance heavy-duty wreckers and aesthetic design. Holmes . Our Holmes product line includes mid-priced wreckers with 4 to 16-ton capacities, a 16-ton rotator and a detachable towing unit (DTU). The Holmes wrecker was first produced in 1916. Historically, the Holmes name has been the most well-recognized and leading industry brand both domestically and internationally. Champion . The Champion brand, which was introduced in 1991, includes car carriers which range in length from 19 to 21 feet. The Champion product line, which is generally lower-priced, allows us to offer a full line of car carriers at various competitive price points. Chevron . Our Chevron product line is comprised primarily of premium car carriers. Chevron produces a range of premium single-car, multi-car and industrial carriers, as well as wreckers ranging from 8-ton to 16-ton models. Eagle . Our Eagle products consist of light-duty wreckers with the Eagle Claw hook-up system that allows towing operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the tow truck. The Eagle Claw hook-up system was originally developed for the repossession market. Since acquiring Eagle, we have upgraded the quality and features of the Eagle product line and expanded its recovery capability. Titan . Our Titan product line is comprised of premium multi-vehicle transport trailers which can transport up to 7 vehicles depending on configuration. Jige . Our Jige product line is comprised of a broad line of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers and car carriers marketed primarily in Europe. Jige is a market leader best known for its innovative designs of car carriers and light-duty wreckers necessary to operate within the narrow confines of European cities, as well as heavy-duty wreckers. Boniface . Our Boniface product line is comprised predominantly of premium heavy-duty wreckers marketed primarily in Europe. Boniface produces heavy-duty wreckers specializing in the long underlift technology required to tow modern European tour buses.

 Product Development and Manufacturing Product Innovation and Manufacturing Process Improvements We have a long history of innovation in our products and manufacturing processes based on advanced technologies. Our Holmes and Century brand names are associated with four of the major innovations in the industry: the rapid reverse winch; the tow sling; the hydraulic lifting mechanism; and the underlift with parallel linkage and L-arms. Our engineering department currently consists of over 55 engineers who, in consultation with manufacturing personnel, use sophisticated computer-aided design and stress analysis systems to test new product designs and to integrate various product improvements. In addition to licensing new technologies, we have a continuing emphasis on research and development to achieve product innovations. At our free-standing research and development (R D) facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we are pursuing innovations in our products and improvements in our manufacturing processes, some of which are intended to enhance the safety of our employees and towing equipment operators and reduce the environmental impact of both our manufacturing processes and the products we manufacture. These efforts led to our exclusive product, the M100, which we believe to be the world s largest tow truck. We manufacture wreckers, car carriers and trailers at six manufacturing facilities located in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of cutting and bending sheet steel or aluminum into parts that are welded together to form the wrecker, car carrier body or trailer. In addition, we also produce wrecker bodies using composites and other non-metallic materials, which reduces the overall vehicle weight and increases fuel efficiency. After the frame is formed, components such as hydraulic cylinders, winches, valves and pumps, which are purchased by us from third-party suppliers, are attached to the frame to form the completed wrecker or car carrier body. The completed body is either installed by us or shipped by common carrier to a distributor where it is then installed on a truck chassis. Generally, the wrecker or car carrier bodies are painted, and towing operators can select customized colors to coordinate with chassis colors or customer fleet colors. To the extent final painting is required before delivery, we either complete such painting or contract with independent paint shops for such services. Recent Expansion and Modernization of Domestic Production Facilities All of our domestic facilities have undergone substantial expansion and modernization projects from 2017 to 2021. During that five-year period, we invested over 82 million on property, plant and equipment. These projects not only increased our production capacity, but also included installing sophisticated robotics and implementing other advanced technologies to optimize our manufacturing process, enhance the safety of our employees and towing equipment operators and to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. Reducing the Environmental Impacts of our Domestic Production Facilities We strive to conduct our operations in a manner that protects our employees, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. The recent modernization projects at our domestic facilities included many environment-friendly upgrades, such as the installation of air filtration equipment that removes airborne contaminants like smoke, dust, pollen and dander to improve the air quality at the facilities. As part of these projects, we also transitioned from oil-based primers to water-based primers in our domestic painting operations, to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions into the environment and make our workplace safer for our employees. At the same time, we upgraded the lighting at all of our domestic production facilities to LED lighting, which has the benefit of reducing electric consumption while also increasing visibility for our employees. In 2022, we acquired a nitrogen generator to support our operations, which has the effect of reducing the environmental impacts of transporting nitrogen gas to our domestic facilities. We continue to look for new ways to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly practices at our production facilities to reduce energy-usage, increase recycling and decrease waste. Company Suppliers We purchase raw materials and component parts from several sources. Although we have no long-term supply contracts, management believes we have good relationships with our primary suppliers. In recent years prices have fluctuated significantly, and supply chain challenges have been severe. Prior to these recent challenges, we generally experienced no significant problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules, and found that the materials used in the production of our products were available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers. However, recent supply chain challenges have made us more concerned that the loss of a single supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply

 chain challenges generally lessened in the second half of 2022, but these challenges are expected to continue to affect our ability to complete finished goods in a timely manner and to impact our costs of operations. Sales, Distribution and Marketing The industry categorizes the towing and recovery market into three general product types: light-duty wreckers; heavy-duty wreckers; and car carriers. The light-duty wrecker market consists primarily of professional wrecker operators, repossession towing services, local and national governmental entities and repair shop or salvage company owners. The heavy-duty market includes professional wrecker operators serving the needs of commercial vehicle operators as well as governmental entities. The car carrier market has expanded to include equipment rental companies that offer delivery service and professional towing operators who desire to complement their existing towing capabilities. We sell our products to a diverse network of independent distributors, consisting of approximately 80 distributors in North America, who serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and numerous distributors that serve other foreign markets. These distributors then sell our products to the end-users Our distributor network has been stable for many years, with a large majority of our distributors having been engaged to sell our products for more than 10 years, and many for more than 25 years. We believe this distributor loyalty results primarily from our high quality and innovative products and our emphasis on customer service. These long-standing relations give our distributors a deep knowledge of our products and our corporate culture, allowing them to effectively promote our products to end-users. While we do not impose exclusivity requirements on our distributors, we believe that more than 90 of our independent distributors do not offer products of any other towing and recovery equipment manufacturer, which we believe is a testament to their loyalty to our brands. In 2022, one distributor accounted for 11.2 of our consolidated total sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated total sales and we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any single customer. Management believes that our broad and diverse network of distributors provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market changes, lessens our dependence on particular distributors and reduces the impact of regional economic factors. We engage sales representatives who provide sales support to our entire network of independent distributors. Sales representatives receive commissions on direct sales based on product type and brand and generally are assigned specific territories in which to promote sales of our products and to maintain customer relationships. To support sales and marketing efforts, we produce demonstrator models that are used by our sales representatives and independent distributors. In addition to providing services to our network of independent distributors, our sales representatives sell our products to various governmental entities, including the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, through prime contractors. We routinely respond to requests for proposals or bid invitations in consultation with our local distributors. Our products have been selected by the United States General Services Administration as an approved source for certain federal and defense agencies. We intend to continue to pursue federal, state and local government and foreign government contracting opportunities. The towing and recovery equipment industry places heavy marketing emphasis on product exhibitions at national, regional and international trade shows. To focus our marketing efforts and to control marketing costs at major trade shows each year, we work with our network of independent distributors to concentrate on various regional shows. Product Warranties and Insurance We generally offer a 12-month limited manufacturer s product and service warranty on our wrecker and car carrier products. Our warranty generally provides for repair or replacement of failed parts or components. Our independent distributor customers regularly perform any needed warranty repair work themselves, rather than shipping products back to us, and then invoice us for the cost of the parts and labor. Management believes that we maintain adequate general liability and product liability insurance. Backlog We produce virtually all of our products to order. Our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that we believe are firm. The level of backlog at any particular time, however, may not be an appropriate indicator of our future operating performance. Certain

Table of Contents 
 purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification. As a result of the lingering impacts of the supply chain disruptions that began in fiscal 2021, our current backlog is at historically high levels of orders. Our ability to reduce these high backlog levels will depend on future production schedules and the severity and duration of supply chain disruptions. Competition The towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive for sales to distributors and towing operators. Management believes that competition in our industry focuses on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. We compete on the basis of each of these criteria, with an emphasis on product quality and innovation and customer service. Management also believes that a manufacturer s relationship with distributors is a key component of success in the industry. Accordingly, we have invested substantial resources and management time in building and maintaining strong relationships with distributors. Management also believes that our products are regarded as high quality within their particular price points. Our marketing strategy is to continue to compete primarily on the basis of quality and reputation rather than solely on the basis of price, and to continue to target the growing group of professional towing operators who as end-users recognize the quality of our products. Traditionally, the capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low. Management believes a manufacturer s capital resources and access to technological improvements have become a more integral component of success in recent years. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than we do. Human Capital We employed approximately 1,450 people as of December 31, 2022. Part-time employees represent 1 of our total employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, though our employees in France and the United Kingdom have certain similar rights provided by their respective government s employment regulations. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our Company culture is based on treating others the way we would like to be treated and we strive to foster a work environment that is inclusive, diverse, fair and engaged. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is intended to reinforce our core values of respect, integrity, collaboration, innovation, trust, and excellence throughout our operations. During fiscal 2022, we experienced substantially increased employee turnover rates in our skilled workforce and in response have taken various actions to attract and retain skilled laborers, including attending hiring events, broadening our recruitment platforms, paying sign-on and retention bonuses, offering enhanced wages, and providing training programs. Our key recruitment and retention strategies are also advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives: Employee Development/Training To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we provide training programs that address skills shortages in our workforce, foster career development, and encourage proper use of technology and resources. These include our Welding School that teaches employees how to read blueprints, interpret weld symbols, and learn welding technique. In addition, Miller University One and Two were created to develop high potential employees for future leadership roles in the company, and provide change management, decision making, and problem-solving skills to future leaders of our Company. We have also established a tuition reimbursement program for continuing education, including undergraduate and graduate degrees or certifications and licenses relevant to the business. Competitive Pay and Employee Benefits We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, competitive compensation packages and fair compensation practices. For example, we periodically perform compensation studies to ensure competitive pay rates for our employees. In addition, we provide a variety of benefits including but not limited to comprehensive medical coverage, short-term and long-term disability, life insurance, wellness screening, dental coverage, paid time off incentive programs, an employee assistance program, access to telehealth services, and a U.S. 401(k) plan with a Company match.

 Occupational Health and Safety We seek to provide a healthy and safe workplace. The modernization projects at all our domestic facilities in the last few years included many advanced health and safety features, such as the installation of air filtration equipment that removes airborne contaminants like smoke, dust, pollen and dander to improve the air quality at our production facilities. As part of these projects and upgrades, we also transitioned from oil-based primers to water-based primers in our domestic painting operations to reduce total volatile organic compounds emissions and make our workplace safer for our employees. We also upgraded the lighting at our facilities to LED lighting, which has the benefit of reducing electric consumption while also increasing visibility for our employees. We have a safety committee to implement and monitor our various safety programs. We are continually striving to better our workplace safety record and our five-year trend on workplace accidents reflects substantial improvement in this area. We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our employees. We have made and continue to make what we believe to be appropriate modifications to our operations because of COVID-19 to allow us to protect our employees while operating all our facilities consistent with applicable governmental guidelines and orders. Employee Engagement The Company s management team promotes an open door environment in which all feedback and suggestions are welcome. We have invested substantial time and resources in recent years to optimize the engagement, productivity and safety of our workforce, which we believe is the foundation upon which we can maintain our competitive advantages in product quality and customer service. For example, we hired an employee engagement specialist who is dedicated to communicating with our employees. We also actively monitor the satisfaction and engagement of our workforce, including through periodic employee surveys conducted by third-party experts. Intellectual Property Rights Our development of the underlift parallel linkage and L-arms was at the time considered one of the most innovative developments in the wrecker industry. This technology continues to be significant primarily because it allows the damage-free towing of aerodynamic vehicles made of lighter weight materials. This technology, particularly the L-arms, is still used in a majority of commercial wreckers today. Our patents on the L-arms have expired, but we hold a number of utility and design patents for our products. We have also obtained the rights to use and develop certain technologies owned or patented by others. Management believes that, during the life of our patents on our technology, utilizing our patented technology without a license would be an infringement of such patents. Our trademarks M (stylized), Miller Industries (with stylized M ), Century , Holmes , Champion , Challenger , Pro Star , Street Runner , Vulcan , Right Approach and Extreme Angle , among others, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Management believes that our trademarks are well-recognized by dealers, distributors and end-users in their respective markets and are associated with a high level of quality and value. Government Regulations and Environmental Matters We strive to manufacture our products in a way that minimizes environmental impact and maximizes worker health and safety. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with these numerous and sometimes complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past, but we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future. Our facilities and operations could also be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain, and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts. We act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs.

 We are also subject to various federal, state and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, including the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), and U.S. state laws such as California s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. These state laws require an information security program based on an ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event. The GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 grant individuals the right to request that a company delete or de-identify their personal information. There is a strong possibility that other states, including states in which we transact our business, enact their own data security regulations and privacy laws. We do not expect compliance with the various data security or data privacy acts to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We are also subject to the additional diligence and disclosure requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The SEC rules impose these obligations with respect to conflict minerals, defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, which are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. If any conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured by an SEC reporting company originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country, the rules require the issuer to prepare and file a report addressing its efforts to exercise due diligence on the source of such conflict minerals and their chain of custody. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union adopted new requirements for European Union importers of conflict minerals, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, and that may impact and increase the cost of our conflict minerals compliance program. We are also subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act which regulates the description of warranties on products. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of vehicle components. Management believes that continued compliance with various government regulations will not materially affect our operations.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are many factors that affect our business and the results of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of all known material risks that may cause the actual results of our operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. We encourage you to read this section carefully. Risks Relating to Our Operations Macroeconomic trends, including inflation, rising interest rates and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition, as well as our customers ability to fund purchases of our products. Global economic events and other factors, such as restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, the lingering impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have contributed to significant inflation in many of the markets in which we operate. In order to combat inflation and restore price stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks worldwide have raised interest rates and are expected to continue incrementally raising interest rates in 2023. The combination of increased inflation and interest rates may hinder the economic growth in the U.S. and in the global economy. This economic weakness and the possibility of a global recession have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business and financial condition. We continue to monitor these inflationary pressures closely and, when possible, attempt to mitigate the risk associated with them, including by implementing several price increases and surcharges during 2022 and an 8 price increase effective in the first quarter of 2023. While we have attempted to pass increased costs on to our customers, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue doing so in 2023 and beyond. It is possible that sustained price increases, surcharges or price inflation (or inflation pressure generally), in turn, may lead to declines in volume, and while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases, surcharges and inflation, on the one hand, and volume, on the other, there can be no assurance that our projections will prove to be accurate. Further, the continued slowdown, or a recession, in the global economy or in a particular region or industry, inflation or further tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity, including our (as well as our customers and end users ability to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity, and our and their borrowing costs could increase. Our dependence upon outside suppliers for component parts, chassis and raw materials, including aluminum, steel, and petroleum-related products, leaves us subject to changes in price and availability and delays in receiving supplies of such parts, chassis or materials. We are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts. Prices and availability of these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, inflation, currency and commodity price fluctuations, tariffs, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, war (such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine) and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Delays in shipments of our raw materials and purchased component parts, including truck chassis, and government actions related to tariffs on imports and trade policies have previously adversely impacted, and have the potential to further impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We also continue to monitor the impact of the Russia conflict with Ukraine on our fuel costs and supply chain for materials, parts and components, particularly with respect to steel and items with substantial steel content. Our third-party suppliers ability to supply us with component parts and chassis is limited by their available capacity to manufacture the component parts and chassis we require, and to secure adequate freight capacity to deliver them to our facilities. As the economy continued to recover from the impact of the pandemic over the course of 2022, various supply chain disruptions impacted our ability to obtain on a timely basis certain raw materials and purchased component parts that are necessary to our production processes, as well as chassis from third party suppliers, and also resulted in substantial price increases for many materials and parts, and we are continuing to experience such difficulties in early 2023. These supply chain difficulties have had a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. Delays in deliveries of our finished products due to delays of purchased component parts and truck chassis used in our products could also adversely affect future demand for our products if our customers reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand. If these delays, limitations on availability and price increases for raw materials, purchased component parts, and chassis continue, recur or worsen, they will continue to have a material adverse effect on production at our facilities.

 Furthermore, as a result of our supply chain challenges, it has become more difficult to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities purchased materials, component parts and chassis at sufficient volumes. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs, or successfully manage our inventory or our workforce to adapt to the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may incur unexpected production disruption, as well as storage, transportation and labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet our customers delivery schedules and could face the loss of orders or customers as a result. Shortages, price increases and/or delays in shipments of our raw materials and purchased component parts, including truck chassis, have had and should be anticipated to continue to have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial performance, competitive position and reputation. Increases in the cost of skilled labor could adversely impact our business and profitability. The timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor, and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by increasing labor costs in skilled positions. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain our current levels of sales, productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to control the costs of skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements. We must attract, train and retain skilled employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values, including safety standards. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the limited supply of available skilled labor for hire, prevailing wage rates, increases in healthcare and other enhanced employee benefits, in addition to cost increases associated with employee recruitment. The market for qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must ensure that we continue to offer competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees. We experienced substantial increases in employee wages throughout 2022. This trend may continue over the near term, and possibly longer. We continue to monitor our labor costs and attempt to mitigate the risk associated with employee turnover through increased recruiting, training and retention efforts. The impact of these disruptions remains largely out of our control, and we currently anticipate that these factors will continue to have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations during the first half of 2023 and possibly beyond. We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities. In addition, while our employees are not currently members of a union, there can be no assurance that the employees at any of our facilities will not choose to become unionized in the future. Demand from our customers and towing operators is affected by the availability of capital and access to credit. The ability of our customers and of towing operators to purchase our products is affected by the availability of capital and credit to them. Our independent distributor customers rely on floor plan financing in connection with the purchase of our products, and the availability of that financing on acceptable terms has a direct effect on the volume of their purchases. More restrictive lending practices in conjunction with continuing increases in the cost of such financing can prevent distributors from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which limits product offerings available to the end customer and could lead to reduced sales of our products. Additionally, in many cases, a towing operator s decision to purchase our products from one of our distributors is dependent upon their ability to obtain financing upon acceptable terms. Volatility in the capital markets and rising interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing for our customers and towing operators. In the past, such volatility and disruptions to the capital and credit markets, principally in the U.S. and Europe, in the past has decreased the availability of capital to, and credit capacity of, our customers and towing operators. In addition, in the past, certain providers of floor plan financing have exited the market, which made floor plan financing increasingly difficult for our independent distributor customers to secure at those times. This reduced availability of capital and credit has negatively affected the ability and capacity of our customers and of towing operators to purchase towing and related equipment. This, in turn, has negatively impacted sales of our products. If interest rates continue to rise and our customers are unable to access capital or credit, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and as a result, could negatively affect our business and operating results.

 Continued operational challenges caused by our increased sales volumes following the COVID-19 pandemic could result in material delays, increased costs and loss of business opportunities, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Sales volumes for our products increased substantially as the COVID-19 pandemic abated, and the increase in sales volumes has caused a variety of operating challenges, including supply chain constraints and production capacity limitations. Due to our increased sales volumes, we may be unable to scale production in a timely manner to meet demand for our products if we fail to adequately forecast the need for additional manufacturing capacity. The recent major additions and renovations to all our domestic production facilities have positioned us to effectively address these challenges, but they have nevertheless caused increased production costs and delayed deliveries to customers in some instances. In addition, in 2022, we sought additional production capabilities through capital deployment (such as our first quarter 2022 purchase of an additional small facility in Ooltewah, TN to be used in the production of small carrier units) so that we could rely more heavily on our in-house fabrication capabilities. If we are unable to effectively address the operating challenges imposed by increases in sales volume, it could result in delay or termination of orders, the loss of sales and a negative impact on our reputation with our customers, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our recent major additions and renovations to all our domestic facilities may not achieve our intended objectives of lowering costs, improving manufacturing efficiencies in an environmentally conscious way and increasing productivity, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuation. Historically, a portion of our net sales occur outside the United States, primarily in Europe. In addition, we have manufacturing operations at two facilities located in the Lorraine region of France and manufacturing operations in Norfolk, England. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations and trade policies. This includes the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the United Kingdom s Brexit from the European Union and their impact on European and worldwide economic and supply chain conditions, and on our international sales. These developments have created and may continue to create legal, political and economic uncertainties and impacts, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from Europe, disruptions to our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or business partners. All of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a portion of our net sales derived outside the United States, as well as salaries of employees located outside the United States and certain other expenses, are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling and the euro. We are, therefore, subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. Brexit has caused, and may continue to result in, significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including both the British pound sterling and the euro. In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased the risks of doing business abroad in general. Our business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in consumer confidence and in economic conditions in general. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty with respect to these factors may lead to a downturn in our business. The towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature. Historically, the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by wavering levels of consumer confidence, volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability of financing for our customers and towing operators and the overall effects of global economic conditions. We remain concerned about the potential effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions. A prolonged economic downturn, including as a result of political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict or outbreaks of disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and slow or negative growth in the domestic and global economy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.

 Our sales to U.S. and other governmental entities through prime contractors are subject to special risks. We act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. Our U.S. and other government business is subject to the following risks, among others: (i) this business is susceptible to changes in government spending, which may reduce future revenues; (ii) most of our contracts with governmental entities through prime contractors are fixed-price contracts, and our actual costs on any of these contracts could exceed our projected costs, (iii) competition for the award of these contracts is intense, and we may not be successful in bidding on future contracts, and (iv) the products we sell to governmental entities are subject to highly technical requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in unanticipated retrofit costs, delayed acceptance of products, late or reduced payment or cancellation of the contract. Our inability to address any of the foregoing concerns could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Overall demand from our customers may be affected by increases in their fuel and insurance costs and changes in weather conditions. In the past, our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs, and in the cost of insurance. Our customers also have, from time to time, been subject to unpredictable and varying weather conditions which could, among other things, impact the cost and availability of fuel and other materials. More recently, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and market dislocations associated with the economy s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic have both resulted in, and may continue to, result in substantial volatility in fuel costs in the U.S. and worldwide, and the extent and duration of such volatility cannot be predicted. Any of these factors could negatively affect our customers capacity for purchasing towing and related equipment, and, consequently, have a material negative effect upon our business and operating results. Our competitors could impede our ability to attract or retain customers. The towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive. Capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low, which could result in an increase in the number of competitors entering the industry. Competition for sales exists domestically and internationally at the manufacturer, distributor and towing-operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. Competition for sales also comes from the market for used towing and recovery equipment. Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us. If these competitors are able to make it more difficult for us to attract or retain customers, it could have a negative impact on our sales, revenue and financial performance. The catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of any one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, civil unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters Environmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs. We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the ground, air and water; the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties. In certain cases, these regulatory requirements may limit the productive capacity of our operations. Environmental and health-related requirements are complex, subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent. Future developments could cause us to incur various expenditures and could also subject us to fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate 
 14

 or remediate contamination or restore natural resources, liability for third party property damage or personal injury claims and the imposition of new permitting requirements and/or the modification or revocation of our existing operating permits, among other effects. These and other developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts. Failure to comply with domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Our international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in our incurring significant fees and having fines and criminal sanctions imposed on us or our employees, and could adversely impact our business with government entities. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop or acquire proprietary products and technology and assertions against us relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business. Historically, we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition. While we are continuing to develop new technology and apply for patents, if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and technology in the future, our ability to maintain market share, and, consequently, our revenues and operating results, may be negatively affected. Third parties may claim that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to design around their patents, pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations, any of which could be expensive and/or have an adverse effect on our operating results. Third party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources, but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation. Changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate. As a result of our international operations, we are subject to various taxes in both U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws, regulations and rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the adoption of a global minimum tax rate for corporate entities, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Changes to long-standing tax principles in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate or tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA was enacted, the provisions of which include a minimum tax equal to 15 of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1 excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. It is possible that changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, the IRA or other tax legislation could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability. The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business. In 2012, the SEC adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals , originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union adopted new requirements for European Union importers of conflict minerals, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, and that may impact and increase the cost of our conflict minerals compliance program. The Company s supply chain is complex. As a result, we have encountered and continue to expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products and disclosing that our products are conflict free (meaning that they do not contain conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country). We may face reputational challenges from customers, investors or others if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict mineral free. A product warranty or product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage, or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business. We are subject to various claims, including product warranty and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business, and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. We maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience. If we manufacture poor quality products or receive defective materials, we may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what we have reserved in our financial statements. A successful product warranty, product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we are subject to potential recalls of components or parts manufactured by suppliers which we purchase and incorporate into our towing and recovery equipment products, as well as potential recalls of our products from customers to cure manufacturing defects or in the event of a failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards or customers order specifications. Moreover, the adverse publicity that may result from a product liability claim, perceived or actual defect with our products or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market, or from our involvement with activist stockholders. From time to time, there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common stock. Our quarterly operating results, changes in earnings estimated by analysts, if any, changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us, including our ability to pay dividends, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, we seek to actively engage with stockholders and consider their views on business and strategy. However, we could be subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. And publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as governance changes, financial restructurings, increased borrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or to the activists themselves. Responding to activist investors could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, adversely affect our relationships with our employees, customers, or service providers, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management. Further, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to such matters, including fees and expenses for third-party advisors. Perceived uncertainties associated with such activities could interfere with our ability to effectively execute our strategic plan, impact long-term growth, and limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers, and others important to our success. In addition, actions of these stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Our charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price. Our charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements regarding amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws. In addition, our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The rights

 and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock. Risks Related to Indebtedness and Liquidity Our credit facility could restrict our ability to operate our business and failure to comply with its terms could adversely affect our business; our obligations to repurchase products from third-party lenders to our distributors could adversely impact our future revenues and financial condition. Our credit facility, which was increased from 50.0 million to 100.0 million during 2022, contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. In addition, covenants under our current credit facility restrict our ability to pay cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among various restrictions. We have been in compliance with these covenants throughout 2022 and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during 2023. If we fail to comply with the requirements of our current credit facility, such non-compliance would result in an event of default. If not waived by the bank, such event of default would result in the acceleration of any amounts due under the current credit facility. We also have certain obligations to repurchase our products repossessed by third-party lenders if our distributors should default in their obligations to those lenders. Such repurchases could result in reduced net revenue in future periods as we resell such products and, if we are unable to sell the products, could adversely impact our financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will continue to declare dividends on our common stock. Our board of directors approved a dividend policy in 2011 to consider and pay quarterly dividends on our common stock subject to our ability to satisfy all applicable statutory requirements and our continued financial strength. While we currently intend to pay a quarterly dividend on shares of our common stock, to the extent that we have sufficient funds available for such purpose, the declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements and such other factors as they may deem relevant from time to time. General Risk Factors A disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology IT systems or any violation of data protection laws could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems and our ability to update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. We use our IT systems to collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including information about our business, our customers, our suppliers and our employees. We rely on IT systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including natural disasters, such as fires; power loss; software bugs , hardware defects or human error or malfeasance; or security breaches caused by hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber-attacks. The risk of such cyber-attacks may be heightened as a result of the Russian conflict with Ukraine. As technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that are susceptible to both willful and unintentional security breaches. We have incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Despite these efforts, future attacks could result in our systems or data being breached and/or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and/or unauthorized access to controlled data and personal information stored in connection with our human resources function. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to personal information, we are subject to a variety of ever-changing laws on a global basis that may require us to provide notification to the data owners, and that may subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement or harm employee morale.

 Any disruption, outage or breach of our IT systems could result in interruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if our systems are improperly implemented, breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships, harm our business and possibly lead to significant claims, liability, or fines based upon alleged breaches of contract or applicable laws, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance. The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations including the GDPR that became effective in the European Union in 2018. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could increase our cost of providing our products and services. Any loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team because of the management teams experience and skills gained from their long-term service to the Company. The loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We operate five manufacturing facilities in the United States. Two of the facilities are located in Ooltewah (Chattanooga), Tennessee; one in Hermitage, Pennsylvania; and two in Greeneville, Tennessee. The Ooltewah plants, containing an aggregate of approximately 316,000 square feet, produce light and heavy-duty wreckers; the Hermitage plant, containing approximately 279,000 square feet, produces car carriers; and the Greeneville plants, containing an aggregate of approximately 210,000 square feet, produce car carriers, heavy-duty wreckers and trailers. We also operate a free-standing R D facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, containing an aggregate of approximately 34,000 square feet. Between 2017 and 2021, we completed projects to modernize and expand all of our domestic facilities. For a discussion of these capital projects, see Executive Overview in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report. We also have two manufacturing facilities and one storage facility located in the Lorraine region of France, which have, in the aggregate, approximately 205,000 square feet, and manufacturing operations in Norfolk, England, with approximately 48,000 square feet. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is contemplated to be conducted. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal course of our business. Litigation is subject to various inherent uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters could be resolved unfavorably to us, which could result in substantial damages against us. We have established accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable and maintain product liability and other insurance that management believes to be adequate. Management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in excess of available insurance coverage and accruals will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MLR. As of February 28, 2023, there were approximately 386 registered holders of record of our common stock. The number of record holders does not include persons who held our common stock in nominee or street name accounts through brokers. The Company has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends since May 2011. For more information on dividends, see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Any future determination as to the payment of cash dividends will depend upon such factors as earnings, capital requirements, our financial condition, restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Covenants under our current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among various other restrictions. Sales of Unregistered Securities We did not sell any unregistered securities during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all dollar amounts in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are in thousands. As disclosed in Note 11, Correction of Prior Period Errors to our consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, have been revised to give effect to the correction of certain accounting errors identified during the current fiscal year-end financial reporting process. Company Background Miller Industries, Inc. is The World s Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment , with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in France and the United Kingdom. We offer a broad range of equipment to meet our customers design, capacity and cost requirements under our Century , Vulcan , Challenger , Holmes , Champion , Chevron , Eagle , Titan , Jige and Boniface brand names. In this Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the words Miller Industries, the Company, we, our, ours and us refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them. Our management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our overall operating and financial performance. These indicators include measurements of revenue, operating income, gross margin, net income, earnings per share, capital expenditures and cash flow. We derive revenues primarily from product sales made to our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors including general economic conditions as well as demand for, and price of, our products, our technological competitiveness, our reputation for providing quality products and reliable service, competition within our industry, and the cost and availability of purchased component parts, truck chassis and raw materials (including aluminum, steel and petroleum-related products). Our history of innovation in the towing and recovery industry has been an important factor behind our growth over the last decade and we believe that our continued emphasis on research and development will be a key factor in our future growth. We opened a free-standing R D facility in Chattanooga in 2019, where we pursue various innovations in our products and manufacturing processes, some of which are intended to enhance the safety of our employees and reduce our environmental impact. In addition, our recent domestic plant expansion and modernization projects have installed sophisticated robotics and implemented other advanced technologies to increase our production capacity and optimize our manufacturing processes. These projects were completed during the period from 2017 to 2021 at a cost of over 82,000. We completed phase one of the implementation of an enterprise software solution during 2021, and we continued to implement additional functionality available in the solution in 2022. We expect this software to substantially improve our administrative efficiency and customer service levels. As we retain our focus toward modernization, we expect to continue to invest in robotics and automated material handling equipment across all of our domestic manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owed 45,000 and 0, respectively, under its primary credit facility. During 2022, the Company drew 45,000 for working capital needs and retains a balance on its credit facility of 45,000 at February 28, 2023. Factors That Affect Our Operating Results; Trends Conditions Affecting Demand Our industry is, and will continue to be, cyclical in nature, and the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues are influenced by a variety of factors, including: levels of consumer confidence; 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 domestic and international capital and credit markets and the availability and affordability of financing, including floor plan financing, for our customers and towing operators; fuel and insurance costs, and macro-economic conditions such as broad-based inflation, and their effect on the ability of our customers to purchase towing and related equipment; and the overall effects of global, political, economic and health conditions. 
 We remain concerned about the continuing effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions. Costs of Components and Raw Materials; Product Availability; Supply Chain Impacts We have been and will continue to be affected by the availability of, and changes in the prices that we pay for component parts and raw materials, particularly aluminum, steel and petroleum-related products, which represent a substantial part of our total cost of operations. Supply chain challenges such as shortages and delivery delays in component parts and raw materials were generally lessening as 2022 began but the impact of the war in Ukraine and general economic conditions caused these challenges to substantially increase over the first half of 2022. Supply chain disruptions and workforce retention challenges eased substantially during the second half of 2022, but these challenges continued to reduce our ability to complete finished goods without timing delays and to increase our costs of operations. In addition, general inflationary pressures coupled with rising interest rates have substantially increased in 2022, and the rapid strengthening of the US Dollar in comparison to certain other currencies has caused fluctuations within accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and the recognition of significant losses in our condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. We continue to monitor these pressures closely and, when possible, attempt to mitigate the risk associated with them. Historically, we have implemented price increases on our products to offset price increases in the raw materials that we use, and developed new supplier relationships to provide alternative sources for materials and component parts. We have also developed alternatives to some of the components used in our production process that incorporate these raw materials, and our suppliers have implemented these alternatives in the production of our component parts. In 2022, we implemented several price increases and surcharges and we announced an 8 price increase effective in the first quarter of 2023. We have also sought additional production capabilities through capital deployment (such as our first quarter 2022 purchase of an additional small facility in Ooltewah, TN to be used in the production of small carrier units), by monitoring currency rates and purchasing currency denominations at advantageous times, and by relying more heavily on our in-house fabrication capabilities. Trends and Outlook Based on our strong backlog, the surcharge and price increases we have implemented and the current status of our process improvements, our operating results improved towards the end of 2022, and we believe we are well positioned to continue enhancing operating results. However, our performance will be heavily influenced by, among other things, whether supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures worsen, the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine or other geopolitical factors, and the threat of recession and general economic factors. The impact of these factors remains largely out of our control, and we currently anticipate that these factors will continue to have an adverse impact on our production capabilities, financial results and cash flow during 2023. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates. Certain accounting policies are deemed critical, as they require management s highest degree of judgment, estimations and assumptions. A discussion of critical accounting policies, the judgments and uncertainties affecting 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows: Accounts Receivable We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for credit losses is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues. While such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established, there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past. Inventory Inventory costs include materials, labor and factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value. Revisions of these estimates could result in the need for adjustments. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. When a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long-lived asset may not be fully recovered, the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management, or if available, independent appraisals or sales price negotiations. The estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue, operating costs, interest rates, property and equipment additions, and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors. We believe that these estimates are reasonable; however, changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations. Based on these estimates, we believe that our long-lived assets are appropriately valued. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying amount. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, a quantitative assessment. If we perform a qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, no further testing is needed. Alternatively, if we elect to utilize a quantitative assessment, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the goodwill. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill. Such events might include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment or a material change in a relationship with significant customers. Warranty Reserves We estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims. We review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We believe the warranty reserve is adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. When calculating a provision for income tax for each of the years presented in the consolidated statements of income and deferred tax assets and liabilities as of each date presented in the consolidated balance sheets, we make significant estimates related to tax depreciation and inventory capitalization that are subject to review and that may change significantly prior to filing our income tax return. As such, the estimates made to calculate current and deferred tax expense represent a critical accounting estimate which could materially change in future periods. 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in deductible or taxable amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, on the basis of the technical merits. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes because of the evaluation of new information not previously available to us. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Revenues Under our accounting policies, revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs upon shipment, which is when control has transferred to independent distributors or other customers. From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement. Recognition of revenue on bill and hold arrangements occurs when control transfers to the customer. Our policy requires the reason for the bill and hold arrangement to be substantive, and the product to be separately identified as belonging to the customer, ready for physical transfer, and unavailable to be used or directed to another customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the transfer of products. Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Warranty related costs are recognized as an expense at the time products are sold. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, for certain contracts the Company may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because a future obligation has not yet been satisfied, such as an extended service contract. An observable stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach is utilized when one is not available. While we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers and car carriers, which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties, we frequently purchase truck chassis for resale to our customers. Sales of company-purchased truck chassis are included in net sales. Margin percentages are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company-purchased chassis. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, historical rates for equity and the weighted average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity. Intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.

 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, the components of the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 

2022 2021 2020 Net Sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 Costs of operations 90.3 90.3 88.0 Gross Profit 9.7 9.7 12.0 Operating Expenses: Selling, general and administrative 6.2 6.4 6.1 Non-operating (income) expenses Interest expense, net 0.4 0.2 0.2 Other (income) expense, net 0.1 0.1 (0.1) Total expenses, net 6.7 6.7 6.2 Income before income taxes 3.0 3.0 5.8 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Net sales were 848,456 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 717,476 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 18.3 . The increase in our revenue stream was largely attributable to improvement in supply chain disruptions during the latter part of the year, which was in part due to onboarding of new suppliers as well as reengineering our products to overcome part scarcity. Net domestic sales increased from 627,573 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 765,307 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and net foreign sales decreased from 89,903 to 83,149 during the same periods. Costs of operations also increased 18.3 to 766,037 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 647,624 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Overall, costs of operations as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 90.3 for both the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021. The sales price increases implemented in the second half of 2022 offset the dramatic rise of our component part costs during the first half of the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased to 52,827 from 46,233 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased employee compensation and continued inflationary pressures. In addition, we experienced increases in travel related expenses as marketing activites resumed and we intensified efforts to expand our supply chain network during 2022. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.2 for 2022 from 6.4 for 2021. Interest expense, net increased to 3,379 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1,355 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Increases in interest expense, net were primarily due to an increase in interest payments on distributor floor planning, as well interest payments on the credit facility. When the Company has transactions that are denominated in a currency other than its functional currency, the Company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk and must record gains and losses through other (income) expense when the related balance sheet items are remeasured in the functional currency of the Company. Other (income) expense, net is composed primarily of these foreign currency exchange gains and losses, with the remainder being composed of gains and losses on disposals of equipment. The Company experienced a net foreign currency exchange loss of 669 for 2022 compared to a net exchange loss of 536 for 2021. The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 reflects a combined federal, state and foreign tax rate of 21.0 and 25.3 , respectively, which corresponds to a tax provision of 5,386 for 2022 as compared to 5,511 for 2021. Our tax rate in 2022 compares favorably to 2021 primarily due to an increased percentage of income recognized in foreign jurisdictions with higher statutory rates during 2021, which also prohibited the Company from recognizing certain domestic deductions which reward higher levels of domestic earnings in comparison to earnings from foreign jurisdictions during 2021. For more information on the effective tax rate, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 For a comparison of the 2021 to 2020 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 9, 2022 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used in operating activities during 2022 was 19,155, compared to 15,268 cash provided by operating activities during 2021. Cash provided by operating activities is generally attributable to the receipt of payments from our customers as settlement of their contractual obligation once we have fulfilled all performance obligations related to our contracts with them. These cash receipts are netted with payments for purchases of inventory, payments for materials used in manufacturing, and other payments that are necessary in the ordinary course of our operations, such as those for utilities and taxes. During 2022, we continued to increase purchases of materials, components and chassis to ramp up production to meet our historic demand levels and to mitigate various supply chain disruptions. These factors coupled with the increased costs of inventory and labor caused cash provided by operating activities to be exceeded by cash used in operation activities in 2022. During 2021, we used available cash flow from operations toward similar working capital needs, to pay for capital expenditures, and to pay dividends. Cash used in investing activities during 2022 was 28,931, compared to 9,059 used during 2021. The cash used in investing activities for 2022 and 2021 was primarily for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, including an aircraft purchased in 2022 which is used to enhance our marketing efforts, establish and maintain our relationships with key suppliers and visit our facilities that are not easily accessible via commercial air travel. We also continued to invest in manufacturing automation, ERP system enhancements and employee safety initiatives during 2022. Cash provided by financing activities during 2022 was 36,765, compared to 8,238 used during 2021. The cash provided by financing activities in 2022 was attributable to advances on the credit facility of 45,000, offset by dividend payments of 8,220 and an immaterial amount of payments on finance lease obligations. The cash used in financing activities in 2021 was primarily attributable to dividend payments of 8,216 and an immaterial amount of payments on finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 40,153. Our primary cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, the funding of any declared cash dividends and principal and interest payments on indebtedness. During 2022, supply chain bottlenecks required us to continue allocating cash to working capital at higher than our normal levels in order to allow inventory to be produced to completion as quickly as the supply chain allowed. Accounts payable balances and raw materials and work in process inventory balances at December 31, 2022 increased significantly when compared to the prior year balances. Such constraints also impacted our ability to reduce our backlog, which remain at historically high levels. These supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks improved substantially over the second half of 2022 but are continuing into 2023. However, we are optimistic that our efforts to supplement our supplier network and reengineer our products will improve our ability to finalize deliveries on a timely basis throughout 2023, allowing cash to be allocated consistent with the Company s past practices and the buildup in backlog to be reduced. At December 31, 2022, we had commitments of approximately 6,351 for the acquisition of property and equipment. As of December 31, 2022, we also had commitments of 2,565 in software license fees, all of which is expected to be settled over the next three years. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 we had purchase obligations of 94,356 arising from open purchase orders, which increased from 90,494 at December 31, 2021 as a result of materials and component cost increases and ramp up of production to meet customer demand. We expect all such purchase order obligations will be settled during 2023. We expect our primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations and cash and temporary investments on hand at December 31, 2022, with borrowings under our credit facility being available as needed. We expect these sources to be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during 2023 and for the next several years. However, our ability to satisfy our cash needs will substantially depend upon a number of factors including our future operating performance, taking into account the economic, regulatory and other factors discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report, as well as financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 18,254 and 28,983, respectively, of the Company s cash and temporary investments were held by foreign subsidiaries based in the local currency. We do not currently have plans to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings to the United States and have not determined any timeline or amount for any such future distributions.

 For a discussion of the 2021 reporting period, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 9, 2022 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Credit Facility and Other Obligations Credit Facility On December 21, 2020, we amended and restated our loan agreement with First Horizon Bank (successor in interest to First Tennessee Bank National Association) First Horizon ). The loan agreement provided for a 50 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 31, 2027. Borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the loan agreement) plus 1.00 or 1.25 per annum, and we are required to pay a quarterly non-usage fee at a rate per annum equal to between 0.15 and 0.35 of the unused amount of the credit facility. The credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. Amended and restated covenants under the credit facility restrict payment of cash dividends if we would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test as a result of the dividend, among other restrictions. On October 28, 2022, we entered into a first amendment to the loan agreement with First Horizon. Among other things, the amendment increased availability under the credit facility to a maximum principal amount of 100,000, made certain technical and operational adjustments necessary to implement one month Term SOFR as the primary interest rate index under the facility and added a new asset coverage financial covenant test. All other material terms and conditions of the credit facility remained unchanged. We were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2022. Outstanding Borrowings As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 45,000 and 0 borrowings outstanding under the credit facility, respectively, and retains a balance of 45,000 at February 28, 2023. Changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on indebtedness under our credit facility because the outstanding amounts of indebtedness under our current credit facility are subject to variable interest rates. Under our credit facility, the non-default rate of interest is equal to the one month Term SOFR plus 1.00 or 1.25 per annum, depending on our leverage ratio, for a rate of interest of 5.47 at December 31, 2022. A one percent change in the interest rate on our variable-rate debt would not have materially impacted our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other Long-Term Obligations Prior to applying a discount rate to our lease liabilities, we had approximately 926 in non-cancellable operating lease obligations and no non-cancellable finance lease obligations at December 31, 2022. Leases with original contractual terms less than one year were excluded from non-cancellable lease obligations. During 2021, we completed phase one of our enterprise software solution implementation and we continue to implement additional functionality available in the solution during 2022. We expect this software to substantially improve our administrative efficiency and customer service levels. We have 2,565 in remaining contractual payments under our agreement with the software provider, which extends through 2025. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Standards In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805). The update provides guidance on how to measure and recognize contract assets and contract liabilities when purchased as part of a business combination.

 the contract asset or contract liability being purchased. The amendments in the update will be effective for financial statements beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the amendments prospectively. The adoption of this update will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326). The update will require entities with financing receivables to disclose gross write-offs by year of origination of the receivable. The amendments in the update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and will be applied prospectively. The adoption of this update will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Recently Adopted Standards. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740), which among other things requires the Company to recognize franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax. The Company applied the amendments in the update on a modified retrospective basis, which did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires certain disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The amendments require disclosure of information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions, information regarding the line items within the consolidated financial statements that are affected by the transactions, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all dollar amounts in this Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk are in thousands. Interest Rate Risk Changes in interest rates affect the interest paid on indebtedness under our current credit facility because the outstanding amounts of indebtedness under our current credit facility are subject to variable interest rates. Under our current credit facility, the non-default rate of interest is equal to the one month Term SOFR per annum, depending on our leverage ratio, for a rate of interest of 5.47 at December 31, 2022. A one percent change in the interest rate on our variable-rate debt would not have materially impacted our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. Foreign Currency Risk We are subject to risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations in Europe. We manage our exposure to our foreign currency exchange rate risk through our regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our results of operations and cash flows was a net foreign currency exchange loss of 669, loss of 536, and gain of 685, respectively. Because we report in U.S. dollars on a consolidated basis, foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position. During 2022, we recognized a 4,228 decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment account because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, compared to a decrease of 2,156 during 2021 and an increase of 2,714 during 2020.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment under those criteria, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Elliott Davis, LLC, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which appears herein.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Miller Industries, Inc.: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15 (collectively, the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

Contingencies The Company has entered into arrangements with third-party lenders where it has agreed, in the event of default by a distributor within the independent distributor network, to repurchase from the third-party lender company products repossessed from the independent distributor customer. These arrangements are typically subject to a maximum repurchase amount. The maximum amount of collateral that the Company could be required to purchase was approximately and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s risk under these arrangements is mitigated by the value of the products that would be repurchased as part of the transaction. The Company considered the fair value at inception of its liability under these arrangements and concluded that the liability associated with these potential repurchase obligations was not probable and thus not material at December 31, 2022 or 2021. No repurchases of products were required during 2022 or 2021. The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal course of its business. Litigation is subject to various inherent uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters could be resolved unfavorably to the Company, which could result in substantial damages against the Company. The Company has established accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable and maintains product liability and other insurance that management believes to be adequate. Management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in excess of available insurance coverage and accruals will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes. Temporary differences and carry forwards which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: Accruals and reserves Research and development Other Total deferred tax assets Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant, and equipment Other Total deferred tax liabilities Valuation Allowance Net deferred tax asset/(liability) ) ) Deferred tax assets represent the future tax benefit of future deductible differences and, if it is more likely than not that a tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to net realizable value. The Company has evaluated positive and negative evidence to assess the realizability of its deferred taxes. Based on the evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, the Company has not included a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at this time. We do not currently have plans to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings to the United States and have not determined any timeline or amount for any such future distributions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards, and a state net operating loss carryforward of approximately . Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being recognized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company reported unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets and activity relating to unrecognized tax positions were recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company is subject to United States federal income taxes, as well as income taxes in various states and foreign jurisdictions.
