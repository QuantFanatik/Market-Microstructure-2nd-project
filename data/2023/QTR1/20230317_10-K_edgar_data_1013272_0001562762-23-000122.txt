In the aggregate, the merger consideration paid to North Penn shareholders consisted of approximately 10,648,000 in cash and 530,994 shares of the Common Stock. Competition The competition for deposit products comes from other insured financial institutions such as commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, and multi-state regional banks in the Company s market area of Wayne, Pike, Monroe, Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties, Pennsylvania and Delaware, Sullivan, Ontario, Otsego and Yates Counties, New York as well as from on-line banks. Based on data compiled by the FDIC as of June 30, 2022 (the latest date for which such data is available), the Bank had the third largest share of FDIC-insured deposits in Wayne County with approximately 22.63 , the second largest share in Pike County with 17.83 , seventh largest share in Monroe County with 3.55 , the eleventh largest share in Lackawanna County with 1.04 and the seventeenth largest share in Luzerne County with 0.28 . At June 30, 2022, the Bank had the largest share of FDIC-insured deposits in Delaware County, New York, with 30.01 and the fifth largest share in Sullivan County, New York, with 7.95 . The Bank s market share in Ontario, Otsego and Yates Counties were 3.82 , 16.32 and 12.60 , respectively. This data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions with which the Bank also competes. Deposit competition also includes a number of insurance products sold by local agents and investment products such as mutual funds and other securities sold by local and regional brokers. Loan competition varies depending upon market conditions and comes from other insured financial institutions such as commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, multi-state regional banks, and mortgage bankers. Personnel As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 274 full - time and two part - time employees. None of the Bank s employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. Trust Activities The Bank operates a Wealth Management/Trust Department which provides estate planning, investment management and financial planning to customers for which it is generally compensated based on a percentage of assets under management. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 184.9 million of assets under management compared to 196.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease reflects reduced market valuations during 2022, such as stock market performance which can affect the value of a customer s investment portfolio. Subsidiary Activities The Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered bank, is the only wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Norwood Investment Corp. NIC ), a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1996 and a Pennsylvania licensed insurance agency, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance of foreclosed properties on which WTRO held title totaled 346,000 and 1,742,000, respectively. Regulation Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws which relate to the regulation of the Company and the Bank. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Regulation of the Company General. The Company, as a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA ), is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to file periodic reports of its operations with, and is subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that the Company limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of its subsidiary bank. Under the BHCA, the Company generally must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it may acquire control of another bank or bank holding company, merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 of such shares. Federal statutes impose restrictions on the ability of a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries to obtain extensions of credit from its subsidiary bank, on the subsidiary bank s investments in the stock or securities of the holding company, and on the subsidiary bank s taking of the holding company s stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services by the subsidiary bank. Source of Strength Doctrine. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under this source of strength doctrine, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital - raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve regulations, or both. Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of the Company, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the BHCA. Under the BHCA and the Federal Reserve s bank holding company regulations, a bank holding company generally may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, (1) banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the BHCA and (2) any business activity the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. These include any incidental activities necessary to carry on those activities, as well as a lengthy list of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition to the above authority, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in a broad range of additional activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, and making merchant banking investments. The Company has not made an election to be deemed a financial holding company. Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulatory capital rules pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. The Federal Reserve s capital rules are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the FDIC. See Regulation of the Bank-Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, however, exempts from the regulatory capital requirements bank holding companies with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC. As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications.

Regulation of the Bank General. As a Pennsylvania chartered, FDIC-insured commercial bank which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the Department and by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. The federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. Pennsylvania Banking Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code Banking Code contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA ), however, prohibits state-chartered banks from making new investments, loans, or becoming involved in activities as principal and equity investments which are not permitted for national banks unless (1) the FDIC determines the activity or investment does not pose a significant risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund and (2) the bank meets all applicable capital requirements. Accordingly, the additional operating authority provided to the Bank by the Banking Code is significantly restricted by the FDIA. Interstate Banking. Wayne Bank operates branches in Pennsylvania and New York. Under the federal Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (the Riegle-Neal Act ), an insured state bank that establishes a branch in another state may conduct any activity at such branch that is permissible under the laws of its home state to the extent that such activity is permissible either for a bank chartered by the host state or for a branch of an out-of-state national bank in the host state. The laws of the host state, including laws regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending and branching within the host state, apply to any branch of an out-of-state bank to the same extent as such laws apply to a branch of an out-of-state national bank. The Riegle-Neal Act prohibits out-of-state banks from using their interstate branches primarily for purposes of deposit production. If a federal banking regulator reasonably determines from available information that an out-of-state bank s level of lending in a host state is less than half the loan-to-deposit ratio for all banks in the host state, the regulator may order the closure of the out-of-state branches or prohibit the opening of new branches in the host state unless the out-of-state bank has an acceptable plan or can give reasonable assurances that it will reasonably help meet the credit needs of the communities served in the host state. Federal Deposit Insurance. The Bank s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. The general maximum deposit insurance amount is 250,000. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments established by the FDIC to maintain the DIF. Under the FDIC s risk- based assessment system, banks that are deemed to be less risky pay lower assessments. Assessment rates for small institutions (those with less than 10 billion in assets) are based on an institution s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios and are applied to the institution s assessment base, which equals its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule that increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment is expected to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the statutory minimum of 1.35 by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028, consistent with the FDIC s amended restoration plan. The FDIC assessment rates effective January 1, 2023 (which are subject to certain adjustments) range from 5 to 18 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 8 to 32 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 18 to 32 basis points for those with CAMELS composite scores of 4 or 5. Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy rules adopted by the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules apply to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, banks are required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 or core capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4 of total adjusted assets; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6 of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8 of total risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an opt-out election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as common equity Tier 1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25 of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institution s risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. Risk weightings range from 0 for cash to 100 for property acquired through foreclosure, commercial loans, and certain other assets to 150 for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. In addition to the above minimum requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules require banks and covered financial institution holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5 of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7 for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5 for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5 for Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. The Bank is also subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the Department on Pennsylvania-chartered depository institutions. Under the Department s capital requirements, a Pennsylvania bank or savings bank must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined under the FDIC s capital regulations) to total assets of 4 . In addition, the Department has the supervisory discretion to require higher leverage ratio for any institutions based on the institution s substandard performance in any of a number of areas. The Bank was in compliance with both the FDIC and the Pennsylvania capital requirements in effect as of December 31, 2022. Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action . Under applicable federal statutes, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the FDIC s prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 or better and a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0 or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5 or better and a Leverage Ratio of 4.0 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4.0 , a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 or a Leverage Ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements. In particular, the FDIC may require any state non-member bank that is not adequately capitalized to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the non-member bank s capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the bank s activities may be restricted. At December 31, 2022, the Bank qualified as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. In particular, loans by a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10 of a bank subsidiary s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20 of the bank subsidiary s capital and surplus. Further, loans and other extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Transactions with non-affiliates may be treated 

 6 

as transactions with an affiliate to the extent that proceeds from the transaction are used to benefit the affiliate. Federal law also requires that all transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms at least as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. Loans to One Borrower. Under Pennsylvania law, commercial banks have, subject to certain exemptions, lending limits to one borrower in an amount equal to 15 of the institution s capital accounts. An institution s capital account includes the aggregate of all capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and general reserves for loan losses. Pursuant to the national bank parity provisions of the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the Bank may also lend up to the maximum amounts permissible for national banks, which are allowed to make loans to one borrower of up to 25 of capital and surplus in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank s loans-to-one-borrower limitation was 31.2 million and the Bank was in compliance with such limitation. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain restricted stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in an amount equal to the greater of 1 of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year or 5 of the Bank s outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Restrictions on Dividends . The Pennsylvania Banking Code states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings and may not be declared or paid unless surplus (retained earnings) is at least equal to contributed capital. The Bank has not declared or paid any dividends which cause the Bank s retained earnings to be reduced below the amount required. Finally, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In addition, t he Federal Reserve s guidance states that a bank holding company should consult with its regional Federal Reserve Bank in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure. Finally, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized. Community Reinvestment . All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA and federal regulations thereunder to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of the Bank, the FDIC is required to assess our record of meeting the credit needs of our entire community. The CRA requires the Bank s record of compliance with the CRA to be taken into account in the evaluation of applications by the Bank or the Company for approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in its most recent CRA performance evaluation by the FDIC in May 2022. In May 2022, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint proposal to modernize the regulations implementing the CRA, which would change both the process and substantive tests that the regulators use to assess the record of each bank in fulfilling its obligation to the community. The regulatory agencies stated that the proposal is intended to achieve the following objectives: (i) expand access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapt to changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (iii) provide greater clarity, consistency and transparency in the application of the regulations and (iv) tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size, business model, and local conditions. The Company will evaluate the impact of the proposal s potential changes to the regulations implementing the CRA and their impact to our financial condition and/or results of operations, which cannot be predicted at this time. Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws . The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 . These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a bank s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.

Incentive Compensation . The FDIC and the Federal Reserve review, as part of their regular, risk-focused examinations, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. In 2010, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, is based upon the principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors. In 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at financial institutions having at least 1 billion in total assets. These proposed rules have not been finalized. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges, including Nasdaq, to establish listing standards requiring listed companies to adopt policies providing for the recovery or clawback of excess incentive-based compensation earned by current or former executive officers during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company determines an accounting restatement is required. The SEC final rule will require us to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after the Nasdaq listing standard becomes effective. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not applicable. Item 1B.

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred tax assets, the determination of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, the determination of goodwill impairment and the fair value of financial instruments. Please refer to the discussion of the allowance for loan losses calculation under Allowance for Loan Losses and Non-performing Assets in the Financial Condition section. The deferred income taxes reflect temporary differences in the recognition of the revenue and expenses for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, principally because certain items are recognized in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. Although realization is not assured, the Company believes it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses on securities, the Company considers 1) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and 2) the financial condition of the issuer. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that it will not sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis. The Company believes that any unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 and 2021 represent temporary impairment of the securities. The fair value of financial instruments is based upon quoted market prices, when available. For those instances where a quoted price is not available, fair values are based upon observable market based parameters, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation is applied consistently over time. In connection with the acquisition of North Penn in 2011, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 9.7 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of Delaware in 2016, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 1.6 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of UpState in July 2020, we recorded goodwill in the amount of 17.9 million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of the net assets of the institution acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested annually and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. FINANCIAL CONDITION Total Assets Total assets as of December 31, 2022 were 2.047 billion compared to 2.069 billion as of year-end 2021, a decrease of 21.4 million. The decrease in assets was primarily attributable to the 182.6 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks. Loans Receivable As of December 31, 2022, loans receivable totaled 1.474 billion compared to 1.355 billion as of year-end 2021, an increase of 119.0 million due primarily to a 53.7 million increase in consumer loans. Commercial real estate loans increased 22.8 million, while residential mortgage loans increased 25.8 million during the year. The Bank s loan products include loans for personal and business use. Personal lending includes mortgage lending to finance principal residences and, to a lesser extent, second home dwellings. The Bank s loan products include fixed-rate mortgage products with terms up to 30 years which may be sold in the secondary market through the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae or the FHLB, or held in the Bank s portfolio to the extent consistent with our asset/liability management strategies. Fixed-rate home equity loans are originated on terms up to 180 months. Home equity lines of credit tied to the prime rate are also offered. The Bank also offers indirect dealer financing of automobiles (new and used), boats, and recreational vehicles through a limited network of dealers in Northeast Pennsylvania and the Southern Tier of New York. At December 31, 2022, there were 188.4 million of indirect loans in the portfolio. In connection with the acquisition of UpState in 2020, the Company acquired approximately 413.5 million in loans, including 37.3 million in residential real estate loans, 289.0 million in commercial real estate loans, 92.0 million in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, and 2.3 million in consumer loans. As of December 31, 2022, the approximate outstanding balance of these acquired loans was 233.3 million. In connection with the acquisition of Delaware, the Company acquired approximately 116.7 million in loans, including 68.7 million in residential real estate loans, 22.5 million in commercial real estate loans, 13.6 million in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, 6.5 million in consumer loans and 5.4 in construction loans. As of December 31, 2022, the approximate outstanding balance of these acquired loans was 30.7 million. Commercial loans and commercial mortgages are provided to local small and mid-sized businesses at a variety of terms and rate structures. Commercial lending activities include lines of credit, revolving credit, term loans, mortgages, various forms of secured lending and a limited amount of letter of credit facilities. The rate structure may be fixed, immediately repricing tied to the prime rate or adjustable at set intervals. Also included in commercial loans are municipal finance lending in which the Bank has been active in recent years. Municipal lending includes both general obligations of local taxing authorities and revenue obligations of specific revenue 

 12 

producing projects such as sewer authorities and educational units. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had approximately 141.9 million in loans on commercial rentals, as well as 113.0 million of loans outstanding on residential rentals, which are its largest lending concentrations. The Bank s construction lending has primarily involved lending for commercial construction projects and for single-family residences. All loans for the construction of speculative sale homes have a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 80 . For both commercial and single-family projects, loan proceeds are disbursed during the construction phase according to a draw schedule based on the stage of completion. Construction projects are inspected by contracted inspectors or bank personnel. Construction loans are underwritten on the basis of the estimated value of the property as completed. For commercial projects, the Bank typically also provides the permanent financing after the construction period, as a commercial mortgage. The Bank also, from time to time, originates loans secured by undeveloped land. Land loans granted to individuals have a term of up to five years. Land loans granted to developers may have an interest only period during development. The substantial majority of land loans have a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 75 . The Bank has limited its exposure to land loans but may expand its lending on raw land, as market conditions allow, to qualified borrowers experienced in the development and sale of raw land. Loans involving construction financing and loans on raw land have a higher level of risk than loans for the purchase of existing homes since collateral values, land values, development costs and construction costs can only be estimated at the time the loan is approved. The Bank has sought to minimize its risk in construction lending and in lending for the purchase of raw land by offering such financing primarily to builders and developers to whom the Bank has loaned funds in the past and to persons who have previous experience in such projects. The Bank also limits construction lending and loans on raw land to its market area, with which management is familiar. Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risks associated with changes in interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for payment default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate may also be limited by the maximum periodic interest rate adjustment permitted in certain adjustable-rate mortgage loan documents, and, therefore is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. These risks have not had an adverse effect on the Bank. The Bank s adjustable-rate loan portfolio includes approximately 4.0 million in loan participations indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR which is expected to be phased out by June 30, 2023. On December 16, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) adopted Regulation ZZ to implement the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the Act ). The Act was approved by Congress on March 15, 2022, to address references to LIBOR in contracts that are governed by US law; will not mature before June 30, 2023; and most importantly, will lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined practical replacement for LIBOR. The final rule replaces references to LIBOR in such contracts with one of five Board-selected benchmark replacements based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), which may include spread adjustments specified in the Act. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by US Treasury securities and published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The final rule identifies Board-selected benchmark replacements for (1) derivative transactions, (2) Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulated entity contracts, (3) Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) asset-based securitizations (ABS), (4) consumer loans, and (5) all other LIBOR contracts for replacing the overnight and one-, three-, six-, and 12-month tenors of US dollar LIBOR in existing contracts that do not provide for use of a clearly defined or practical replacement benchmark rate. The Bank must rely on the lead bank to renegotiate the terms of loans in which the Bank has a participation. There can be no assurance that the lead bank will be able to successfully renegotiate the loans in which the Bank has participations or that the substitute reference rate will perform as satisfactorily as LIBOR. Consumer lending, including indirect financing, provides benefits to the Bank s asset/liability management program by reducing the Bank s exposure to interest rate changes, due to their generally shorter terms. Such loans may entail additional credit risks compared to owner-occupied residential mortgage lending especially when unsecured or secured by collateral such as automobiles that depreciate rapidly. Commercial lending including real-estate related loans entail significant additional risks when compared with residential real estate and consumer lending. For example, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. The payment experience on such loans typically is dependent on the successful operation of the project and these risks can be significantly impacted by the cash flow of the borrowers and market conditions for commercial office, retail, and warehouse space. In periods of decreasing cash flows, the commercial borrower may permit a lapse in general maintenance of the property causing the value of the underlying collateral to deteriorate. The liquidation of commercial property is often more costly and may involve more time to sell than residential real estate. The Bank offsets such factors with requiring more owner equity, a lower loan to value ratio and 

 13 

by obtaining the personal guaranties of the principals. In addition, a majority of the Bank s commercial real estate portfolio is owner-occupied property. Commercial loans and leases are considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than secured real estate lending. The repayment of unsecured commercial business loans is wholly dependent on the success of the borrower s business, while secured commercial business loans may be secured by collateral that may not be readily marketable in the event of default. Municipal financing includes lending to local taxing authorities and revenue-producing projects. Such loans may constitute the general obligation of the taxing authority or may rely on a specific revenue source which is responsible for the repayment of the debt. General obligations are considered to carry a lower level of risk than other loan types since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the taxing authority. Revenue obligations are backed solely by revenues generated by the project financed and repayment may be affected by the success of the project. Due to the type and nature of the collateral, consumer lending generally involves more credit risk when compared with residential real estate lending. Consumer lending collections are typically dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness and personal bankruptcy. In most cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan will not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency is usually turned over to a collection agency. There are additional risks associated with indirect lending since we must rely on the dealer to provide accurate information to us and accurate disclosures to the borrowers. These loans are principally done on a non-recourse basis. We seek to mitigate these risks by only dealing with dealers with whom we have a long-standing relationship. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits lenders from making residential mortgages unless the lender makes a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage loan according to its terms. A borrower may recover statutory damages equal to all finance charges and fees paid within three years of a violation of the ability-to-repay rule and may raise a violation as a defense to foreclosure at any time. As authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB has adopted regulations defining qualified mortgages that are presumed to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act s ability-to-repay rules. Under the CFPB regulations, qualified mortgages must satisfy the following criteria: (i) no negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or term greater than 30 years; (ii) no points or fees in excess of 3 of the loan amount for loans over 100,000; (iii) borrower s income and assets are verified and documented; and (iv) the borrower s debt-to-income ratio generally may not exceed 43 . Qualified mortgages are conclusively presumed to comply with the ability-to-pay rule unless the mortgage is a higher cost mortgage, in which case the presumption is rebuttable. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2018, residential mortgages originated for portfolio by insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets will be treated as qualified mortgages; provided that the mortgage terms do not include interest-only payments or negative amortization, total points and fees do not exceed 3 of the loan amount, prepayment penalties are not in excess of those permitted for qualified mortgages under Regulation Z and the lender has considered and documented the debt, income and financial resources of the borrower. The Bank has established various lending limits for its officers and also maintains an Officer Loan Committee to approve higher loan amounts. The Officer Loan Committee is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer and other Bank officers. The Officer Loan Committee has the authority to approve all loans up to set limits based on the type of loan and the collateral. Requests in excess of these limits must be submitted to the Directors Loan Committee or Board of Directors for approval. Additionally, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Lending Officer and other officers have the authority to approve secured and unsecured loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors and maintained in the Bank s Loan Policy. Notwithstanding individual lending authority, certain loan policy exceptions must be submitted to the Officer Loan Committee for approval. Hazard insurance coverage is required on all properties securing loans made by the Bank. Flood insurance is also required, when applicable. Loan applicants are notified of the credit decision by letter. If the loan is approved, the loan commitment specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount, interest rate, amortization term, a brief description of the required collateral, and the required insurance coverage. The borrower must provide proof of fire, flood (if applicable) and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral and title insurance, and these applicable insurances must be maintained during the full term of the loan.

 allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses totaled 16,999,000 as of December 31, 2022 and represented 1.15 of total loans receivable compared to 16,442,000 and 1.21 of total loans as of year-end 2021. Net charge-offs for 2022 totaled 343,000 and represented 0.02 of average loans compared to 908,000 and 0.07 of average loans in 2021. Management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The process includes a review of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. It also includes an analysis of impaired loans and a historical review of losses. Other factors considered in the analysis include: concentrations of credit in specific industries in the commercial portfolio, the local and regional economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, internal risk rating classifications, total loan growth in the portfolio and fluctuations in large balance credits. For loans acquired, including those that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining credit discounts. The Company has limited exposure to higher-risk loans. The Company does not originate option ARM products, interest only loans, sub-prime loans or loans with initial teaser rates in its residential real estate portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 14,437,000 million of junior lien home equity loans. For the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 5,000 of charge-offs for this portfolio, with recoveries of 5,000 in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company considered its concentration of credit risk profile to be acceptable. The highest concentrations are in commercial rentals and the residential rentals categories. At December 31, 2022, the recorded investment in impaired loans, not requiring an allowance for loan losses, was 413,000 (net of charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses of 0). The recorded investment in impaired loans, requiring an allowance for loan losses, was 50,000, (net of charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses of 0). At December 31, 2021, the recorded investment in impaired loans, not requiring an allowance for loan losses, was 157,000 (net of charge-offs of 0). The recorded investment in impaired loans, requiring an allowance for loan losses, was 1,517,000. As a result of its analysis, after applying these factors, management considers the allowance as of December 31, 2022, adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover significant losses that might be incurred in the future.

The following table sets forth the allocation of the Bank s allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the date indicated. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which credit losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan. As of December 31, 2022 2021 of of Loans Loans to Total to Total Amount Loans Amount Loans (dollars in thousands) Real estate residential 2,833 20.3 2,175 20.1 Real estate commercial 8,293 44.2 10,878 46.4 Real estate agricultural 259 4.7 4.6 Real estate construction 409 2.2 133 1.6 Commercial 2,445 12.7 1,490 13.7 Other agricultural loans 124 2.4 2.8 Consumer 2,636 13.5 1,766 10.8 Total 16,999 100 16,442 100 
 As a result of the acquisition of UpState, the Company added 107.3 million of agricultural loans to the loan portfolio. These loans are included in the outstanding balance information, but do not require an allocation of the allowance for loan losses since they were recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 310-20 and ASC 310-30. Additional information about the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 2 and Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements. Non-Performing Assets Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and real estate owned as a result of foreclosure, which is held for sale. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that a borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. Commercial and real estate related loans are generally placed on non-accrual when interest is 90 days delinquent. When loans are placed on non-accrual, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2022, non-performing loans totaled 1,113,000 and represented 0.08 of total loans compared to 734,000 or 0.05 as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the level of non-performing loans was due primarily to one credit relationship in the amount of 452,000 that was transferred to non-accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2022. Foreclosed real estate owned totaled 346,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 1,742,000 as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, one property with a carrying value of 1,396,000 was disposed of through a sale. The Company recorded a gain of 427,000 on the sale of the property during the year ended December 31, 2022. Securities The securities portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agencies, mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and municipal obligations. The Company classifies its investments into two categories: held to maturity (HTM) and available for sale (AFS). The Company does not have trading securities. Securities classified as HTM are those in which the Company has the ability and the intent to hold the security until contractual maturity. As of December 31, 2022, there were no securities carried in the HTM portfolio. Securities classified as AFS are eligible to be sold due to liquidity needs or interest rate risk management. These securities are adjusted to and carried at their fair value with any unrealized gains or losses recorded net of deferred income taxes, as an adjustment to capital and reported in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2022, 418.9 million of securities were so classified and carried at their fair value, with unrealized losses, net of tax, of 57.9 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity. The Company considers its investment portfolio a source of earnings and liquidity. Investment securities may also be pledged to secure public deposits and customer repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, the average life of the portfolio was 7.3 years. The Company has maintained a relatively short average life in the portfolio in order to generate cash flow to support loan growth and maintain liquidity levels. Purchases for the year 

 17 

totaled 130.8 million, while maturities and principal reductions totaled 40.8 million and proceeds from sales were 5.1 million. The purchases were funded principally by cash flow generated from the portfolio and excess overnight liquidity. The following table sets forth certain information regarding securities not carried at fair value through earnings, weighted average yields, and maturities of the Company s securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Yields on tax-exempt securities are stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a Federal tax rate of 21 . Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as certain instruments have call features which allow prepayment of obligations. Maturity on the mortgage-backed securities is based upon contractual terms, the average life may differ as a result of changes in cash flow.

 The portfolio had no adjustable-rate instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The portfolio contained no private label mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), or trust preferred securities, and no off-balance sheet derivatives were in use. As of December 31, 2022, the portfolio did not contain any step-up bonds. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio includes pass-through bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO s) issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The Company evaluates the securities in its portfolio for other-than-temporary-impairment (OTTI) as fair value declines below cost. In estimating OTTI, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent of the decline in fair value and (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 343 investment securities in a loss position, which had a combined unrealized loss of 73.3 million. Management believes that these losses are principally due to changes in interest rates and represent temporary impairment as the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of their cost basis. No impairment charges were recognized in 2022 or 2021. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and determine fair value disclosures (see Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Approximately 420.4 million, which represents 20.5 of total assets at December 31, 2022, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. This amount consists entirely of the Company s available for sale securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. The Company uses valuation methodologies involving market-based or market-derived information, collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements, to measure fair value. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 for any instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company utilizes a third party provider to perform valuations of the investments. Methods used to perform the valuations include: pricing models that vary based on asset class, available trade and bid information, actual transacted prices, and proprietary models for valuations of state and municipal obligations. In addition, the Company has a sample of fixed-income securities valued by another independent source. The Company does not adjust values received from its providers, unless it is evident that fair value measurement is not consistent with the Company s policies. The Company also utilizes a third party provider to provide the fair value of certain loan servicing rights. Fair value for the purpose of this measurement is defined as the amount at which the asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 

 18 

parties, other than in a forced liquidation. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 498,000 and 500,000, respectively. DEPOSITS The Bank provides a full range of deposit products to its retail and business customers. These include interest-bearing and noninterest bearing transaction accounts, statement savings and money market accounts. Certificate of deposit terms range up to five years for retail instruments. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank does not have any brokered deposits obtained through internet listing services, and no broker deposits which were secured through Cede Co. The Bank participates in the Jumbo CD 100,000 and over) markets with local municipalities and school districts which are typically priced on a competitive bid basis.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total of uninsured deposits of the Company was 213,623,000 and 235,515,000, respectively. Total uninsured deposits is calculated based on regulatory reporting requirements and reflects the portion of any deposit of a customer at an insured depository institution that exceeds the applicable FDIC insurance coverage for that depositor at that institution and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regime. As of December 31, 2022, the total of U.S. time deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits were 213,623,000. The following table indicates the amount of time deposits that are uninsured by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2022: Amount (in thousands) 
 Three months or less 46,123 Over 3 through 6 months 51,847 Over 6 months through 12 months 67,281 Over 12 months 48,372 213,623 
 Total deposits as of December 31, 2022, were 1.728 billion, a decrease of 29.1 million from December 31, 2021. Non-maturity interest-bearing deposits increased 2.0 million in 2022, while non-interest bearing demand deposits decreased 6.1 million. Time deposits decreased 24.9 million during 2022. Time deposits over 250,000, which consist principally of school district funds, other public funds and short-term deposits from large commercial customers with maturities generally less than one year, totaled 213.6 million as of December 31, 2022, 

 19 

compared to 257.2 million at year-end 2021. These deposits are subject to competitive bid and the Company bases its bid on current interest rates, loan demand, investment portfolio structure and the relative cost of other funding sources. As of December 31, 2022, non-interest bearing demand deposits totaled 434.5 million compared to 440.7 million at December 31, 2021. Cash management accounts in the form of securities sold under agreements to repurchase included in short-term borrowings, totaled 51.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 60.8 million as of December 31, 2021. These balances represent commercial and municipal customers funds invested in overnight securities. The Company considers these accounts as a source of core funding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary Net income for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 29,233,000, which was 4,318,000 higher than the 24,915,000 earned in 2021.

 NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income is the most significant source of revenue for the Company and represented 87.3 of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net interest income (fte) totaled 69,164,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 66,100,000 for 2021, an increase of 3,064,000. The resulting fte net interest spread and net interest margin were 3.38 and 3.53 , respectively, in 2022 compared to 3.39 and 3.50 , respectively, in 2021. Interest income (fte) for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 76,433,000 compared to 71,857,000 in 2021. The fte yield on average earning assets was 3.90 , increasing nine basis points from the 3.81 reported last year. The tax-equivalent yield on total loans remained stable at 4.73 in 2022, while average loans outstanding increased 14.1 million, resulting in an increase in interest income (fte) from loans of 657,000. The yield on securities increased 13 basis points in 2022 due primarily to higher yields on new purchases. During the 2022 year ended, average securities outstanding increased 160.1 million, as cash flows from deposit growth was utilized to fund new purchases, and interest income (fte) from the portfolio increased 3.6 million from the 2021 year ended. Interest expense was 7,269,000 in 2022, which resulted in an average cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 0.52 compared to total interest expense of 5,757,000 in 2021, with an average cost of 0.42 . Total interest-bearing deposits cost was 0.49 in 2022, which was an increase of 11 basis points over the 2021 year. The increase in cost was due primarily to time certificates of deposit that repriced to current market rates upon maturity, resulting in an increase in the interest rate paid from 0.71 in 2021 to 0.97 in 2022. Borrowing costs also increased in 2022, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses was 900,000 in 2022 compared to 4,200,000 in 2021. The decreased provision for loan losses recorded in 2022 reflects the removal of the qualitative factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative factors specific to the pandemic that were developed in 2020 required a 2.3 million allocation to the required allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021. Additionally, the quantitative factor related to historical loan losses decreased 670,000 compared to the 2021 level. Management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. The process includes a review of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. It also includes an analysis of impaired loans and a historical review of losses. Other factors considered in the analysis include: concentrations of credit in specific industries in the commercial portfolio, the local and regional economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, internal risk rating classifications, total loan growth in the portfolio and fluctuations in large balance credits. For loans acquired, including those that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining credit discounts.

 Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk . MARKET RISK Interest rate sensitivity and the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities are managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The principal objective of the ALCO is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk, which are established by policy. Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by using financial modeling techniques to measure the impact of changes in interest rates. Net interest income, which is the primary source of the Company s earnings, is impacted by changes in interest rates and the relationship of different interest rates. To manage the impact of the rate changes, the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities at approximately the same time intervals. The Company uses net interest simulation to assist in interest rate risk management. The process includes simulating various interest rate environments and their impact on net interest income. As of December 31, 2022, the level of net interest income at risk in a 200 basis points increase was within the Company s policy limit of a decline less than 10 of net interest income. Imbalances in repricing opportunities at a given point in time reflect interest-sensitivity gaps measured as the difference between rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. These are static gap measurements that do not take into account any future activity, and as such are principally used as early indicators of potential interest rate exposures over specific intervals. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had a negative 90-day interest sensitivity gap of 46.7 million or 2.3 of total assets. A negative gap indicates that the balance sheet has a higher level of rate-sensitive liabilities (RSL) than rate-sensitive assets (RSA) at the specific time interval. This would indicate that in an increasing rate environment, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities would increase faster than the yield on interest-earning assets in the 90-day period. The level of RSA and RSL for an interval is managed by ALCO strategies, including adjusting the average life of the investment portfolio through purchases and sales, pricing of deposit liabilities to attract long or short-term time deposits, utilizing borrowings to fund loan growth, loan pricing to encourage variable-rate products and evaluation of loan sales of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. 

 25 

The Company analyzes and measures the time periods in which RSA and RSL will mature or reprice in accordance with their contractual terms and assumptions. Management believes that the assumptions used are reasonable. The interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities could vary substantially if differing assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the analysis. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Interest rates may change at different rates changing the shape of the yield curve. The level of rates on the investment securities may also be affected by the spread relationship between different investments. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed. Finally, the ability of borrowers to service their adjustable-rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. It should be noted that the operating results of the Company are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. The following table displays interest-sensitivity as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): 3 Months 3-12 Over Or Less Months 1-3 Years 3 Years Total Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits 3,019 3,019 Securities 8,225 24,995 77,885 307,822 418,927 Loans Receivable 218,811 229,896 445,384 579,854 1,473,945 Total Rate Sensitive Assets (RSA) 230,055 254,891 523,269 887,676 1,895,891 Non-maturity interest-bearing deposits 123,533 119,994 318,673 227,228 789,428 Time Deposits 90,296 245,962 154,207 13,305 503,770 Borrowings 62,902 47,387 22,926 133,215 Total Rate Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) 276,731 413,343 495,806 240,533 1,426,413 Interest sensitivity gap (46,676) (158,452) 27,463 647,143 469,478 Cumulative gap (46,676) (205,128) (177,665) 469,478 RSA/RSL-cumulative 83.1 70.3 85.0 138.5 As of December 31, 2021 Interest sensitivity gap 175,100 (170,159) 11,040 524,379 540,360 Cumulative gap 175,100 4,941 15,981 540,360 RSA/RSL-cumulative 170.5 100.7 101.4 138.4 
 Certain interest-bearing deposits with no stated maturity dates are included in the interest-sensitivity table above. The balances allocated to the respective time periods represent an estimate of the total outstanding balance that has the potential to migrate either through withdrawal or transfer to time deposits, thereby impacting the interest-sensitivity position of the Company. The estimates were derived from a non-maturity deposit study, which was prepared by an independent third party provider. The purpose of the study was to estimate the average lives of various deposit types and their pricing sensitivity to movements in market interest rates. INFLATION Substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities relate to banking activities and are monetary. The consolidated financial statements and related financial data are presented following GAAP. GAAP currently requires the Company to measure the financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, except for securities available for sale, impaired loans, and other real estate loans that are measured at fair value. Changes in the value of money due to rising inflation can cause purchasing power loss. Management s opinion is that movements in interest rates affect the financial condition and results of operations to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. It should be noted that interest rates and inflation do affect each other but do not always move in correlation with each other. The Company s ability to match the interest sensitivity of its financial assets to the interest sensitivity of its liabilities in its asset/liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company s performance.

LIQUIDITY Liquidity is the ability to fund customers borrowing needs and their deposit withdrawal requests while supporting asset growth. The Company s primary sources of liquidity include deposit generation, asset maturities, cash flow from payments on loans and securities and access to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank and other correspondent banks. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 31.9 million in the form of cash, due from banks, balances with the Federal Reserve Bank, and short-term deposits with other institutions. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Company had total securities available for sale of 418.9 million, which could be used for liquidity needs. This totals 450.8 million and represents 22.0 of total assets as of December 31, 2022, compared to 613.5 million and 29.7 of total assets as of December 31, 2021. The Company also monitors other liquidity measures for compliance with Company policy guidelines. Based upon these measures, the Company believes its liquidity position is adequate. The Company maintains established lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB), the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (ACBB) and other correspondent banks, which support liquidity needs. The total available credit under all lines was 190.0 million, with 42.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 0 million outstanding at December 31, 2021. The maximum borrowing capacity from FHLB at December 31, 2022 was 655.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 40.0 million in term borrowings from the FHLB, compared to 30.0 million at December 31, 2021. Outstanding Letters of Credit to secure public funds totaled 92.9 million and 127.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors Description of the Matter The Company s loan portfolio totaled 1.47 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the associated ALL was 17 million. As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in lending policies and practices, economic conditions, changes in the loan portfolio mix, trends in loan delinquencies and classified loans, collateral values, and concentrations of credit risk for the commercial loan portfolios. Auditing the Company s ALL involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgment involved in management s determination and measurement of qualitative factor adjustments included in the estimate of the allowance for loan losses. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL and the need to consider qualitative adjustments. Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. We evaluated the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data and third-party macroeconomic data. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of management s ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors. We also utilized internal credit review specialists to perform procedures on a sample of commercial loans to test the Company s credit risk ratings by comparing key attributes used in the determination of the credit risk rating to supporting documentation such as borrowers financial statements, underlying collateral, financial health of the guarantor, and loan payment history. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2009. March 17, 2023

acquisitions the Company recorded goodwill in the amount of million, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of the Bank. If an impairment loss is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense for the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment loss. impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. , which is net of accumulated amortization of .

million to million. In addition, the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will require the Company to gross up its previously purchased credit impaired loans through the allowance at January 1, 2023. As a result, the Company expects an increase in its allowance as of January 1, 2023, to be in the range of million to million. These estimates are subject to further refinements based on ongoing evaluations of our model, methodologies, and judgments, as well as prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios. At adoption, the Company did not have any securities classified as HTM debt securities. No allowance was recorded related to AFS debt securities at the date of adoption, January 1, 2023. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Update is effective for smaller reporting companies and all other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, March 2020 , to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , which extends the sunset (or expiration) date of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. This gives reporting entities two additional years to apply the accounting relief provided under ASC Topic 848 for matters related to reference rate reform. ASU 2022-06 is effective for all reporting entities immediately upon issuance and must be applied on a prospective basis . This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) , which provides optional temporary guidance for entities transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) to new references rates so that derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions within Topic 848. ASU 2021-01 clarifies that the derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848. ASU 2021-01 is effective immediately for all entities. Entities may elect to apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. The amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made, as well as new hedging relationships entered into, after December 31, 2022, and to existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness for periods after December 31, 2022, except for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01 , Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method . ASC 815 currently permits only prepayable financial assets and one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable financial instruments to be included in a last-of-layer closed portfolio. The amendments in this Update allow non-prepayable financial assets to also be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method. That expanded scope permits an entity

 During 2021 and 2020, the Company participated in the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), administered directly by the United States Small Business Administration SBA ). The PPP provides loans to small businesses who were affected by economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 to provide cash-flow assistance to employers who maintain their payroll (including healthcare and certain related expenses), mortgage interest, rent, leases, utilities and interest on existing debt during the COVID-19 emergency. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding principal balances of and , respectively, in PPP loans. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and may be eligible for forgiveness by the SBA to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll costs, interest costs, rent, and utility costs over a period of up to 24 weeks after the loan is made as long as certain conditions are met regarding employee retention and compensation levels. PPP loans deemed eligible for forgiveness by the SBA will be repaid by the SBA to the Company. PPP loans are included in the Commercial loan category. In accordance with the SBA terms and conditions on these PPP loans, the Company received approximately and million in fees associated with the processing of these loans in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Upon funding of the loans, these fees were deferred and are amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to yield in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20-25-2. As a result of the acquisition of UpState, the Company added of loans that were accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-30. Based on a review of the loans acquired by the Company s senior lending management, which included an analysis of credit deterioration of the loans since origination, the Company recorded a specific credit fair value adjustment of . For loans that were acquired with specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality, loan losses will be accounted for through a reduction of the specific reserve and will not impact the allowance for loan losses until actual losses exceed the allotted reserves. For loans acquired without a deterioration of credit quality, losses incurred will result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses through the allowance for loan loss adequacy calculation.

 There has been allowance for loan losses recorded for acquired loans with specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality. As of December 31, 2022, for loans that were acquired prior to 2020 with or without specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality, adjustments to the allowance for loan losses have been accounted for through the allowance for loan loss adequacy calculation. The Company maintains a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. The system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. The Company does not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential mortgage loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are part of a larger relationship that is impaired, or are classified as a troubled debt restructuring. The following tables show the amount of loans in each category that were individually and collectively evaluated for impairment at the dates indicated: Loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality Collectively evaluated for impairment Total Loans

The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Loans greater than 90 days past due are considered Substandard unless full payment is expected. Any portion of a loan that has been charged off is placed in the Loss category.

Advances from the FHLB are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. office locations under operating leases. Several assumptions and judgments were made when applying the requirements of Topic 842 to the Company s existing lease commitments, including the allocation of consideration in the contracts between lease and nonlease components, determination of the lease term, and determination of the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the lease payments. The Company has elected to account for the variable nonlease components, such as common area maintenance charges, utilities, real estate taxes, and insurance, separately from the lease component. Such variable nonlease components are reported in net occupancy expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income when paid. These variable nonlease components were excluded from the calculation of the present value of the remaining lease payments, therefore, they are not included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The lease cost associated with the operating leases for the year ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, amounted to and respectively. The right-of-use asset associated with operating leases amounted to and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lease liability associated with operating leases amounted to and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain of the Company s leases contain options to renew the lease after the initial term. Management considers the Company s historical pattern of exercising renewal options on leases and the positive performance of the leased locations, when determining whether it is reasonably certain that the leases will be renewed. If management concludes that there is reasonable certainty about the renewal option, it is included in the calculation of the remaining term of each applicable lease. The discount rate utilized in calculating the present value of the remaining lease payments for each lease was the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advance rate corresponding to the remaining maturity of the lease. The following table presents the weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for the leases outstanding at December 31, 2022. years Weighted-average discount rate

The net periodic postretirement benefit expense included in salaries and employee benefits was and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements requires the recognition of a liability and related compensation expense for endorsement split-dollar life insurance that provides a benefit to an employee that extends to postretirement periods. The life insurance policies purchased for the purpose of providing such benefits do not effectively settle an entity s obligation to the employee. Accordingly, the entity must recognize a liability and related compensation expense during the employee s active service period based on the future cost of insurance to be incurred during the employee s retirement. This expense is included in the SERP plan expense for 2022 and 2021 discussed above. If the entity has agreed to provide the employee with a death benefit, then the liability for the future death benefit should be recognized by following the FASB authoritative guidance on employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

 The New York Bankers Retirement System System overall investment strategy is to invest in a diversifiedportfolio while managing the variability between the assets and projected liabilities of underfunded pension plans. The System s Board Members approved a migration (the Migration of substantially all of the System s assets toone fund, Commingled Pensions Trust Fund (LDI Diversified Balanced) of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMCBLDI Diversified Balanced Fund or the Fund ). The Fund is a collective investment fund managed by the Trustee under the Declaration of Trust. The Trustee is the Fund s manager and makes day-to-day investment decisions for the Fund. The Fund is a group trust within the meaning of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, as amended. In reliance upon exemptions from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws, neither the Fund nor the Fund s Units are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC or any state securities commission. Because the Fund is not subject to registration under federal or state securities laws, certain protections that might otherwise be provided to investors in registered funds are not available to investors in the Fund. However, as a bank-sponsored collective investment trust holding qualified retirement plan assets, the Fund is required to comply with applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and the Trustee is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency and the Department of Labor. The Fund employs a liability driven investing LDI strategy for pension plans that are seeking a solution that is balanced between growth and hedging. The Bloomberg Barclays Long A U.S. Corporate Index, the Fund s primary liability-performance benchmark, is used as a proxy for plan projected liabilities. The growth-oriented portion of the Fund invests in a mix of asset classes that the Fund s Trustee believes will collectively maximize total risk-adjusted return through a combination of capital appreciation and income.

Deferred 
 Deferred income taxes reflect temporary differences in the recognition of revenue and expenses for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, principally because certain items, such as the allowance for loan losses and loan fees are recognized in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward that will begin to expire by . A valuation allowance has not been established for deferred tax assets. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. Deferred tax assets are recorded in other assets. Income tax expense of the Company is less than the amounts computed by applying statutory federal income tax rates to income before income taxes because of the following: Tax exempt interest income, net of interest expense disallowance Non-deductible merger related expenses Earnings and proceeds on life insurance Other

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Expected life Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Weighted average fair value of options granted 
 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the contractual life of the awards are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected life is based on historical exercise experience. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled in 2022. Shares issued in connection with stock option exercises are issued from available treasury shares or from available authorized shares.

Unfunded commitments under lines of credit Standby letters of credit 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer and generally consists of real estate. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The majority of these standby letters of credit expire within the next twelve months. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending other loan commitments. The Bank requires collateral supporting these letters

 Securities: The fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management s best estimate is used. Management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) are used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments, if applicable.
