1. BUSINESS 

 Corporate
History 

Purthanol
Resources Limited, a Delaware corporation Purthanol , the Company, we , us or our is a public shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced management and
opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock. 

 No
potential merger candidate has been identified at this time. 

 We
do not propose to restrict our search for a business opportunity to any industry or geographical area and may, therefore, engage in essentially
any business in any industry. We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the
availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors. 

 The
selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may
find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able 

 to
identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select
any potential business opportunity based on our management s best business judgment 

 Our
activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business
and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the
consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased because of its lack of resources and our
inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.

Market
Information 

We
are authorized to issue 260,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share. As of November 30, 2021, 244,038,890 shares
of Common Stock are issued and outstanding. 

 All
of our shares of common stock have equal rights and privileges with respect to voting, liquidation and dividend rights. Each share of
common stock entitles the holder thereof (a) to one non-cumulative vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote
of the stockholders; (b) to participate equally and to receive any and all such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors;
and (c) to participate pro rata in any distribution of assets available for distribution upon liquidation. Holders of our common stock
have no pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock or any other securities. Our common stock is not subject to redemption
and carries no subscription or conversion rights. 

 Our
certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors has the flexibility to set new classes, series, and other terms
and conditions of the preferred shares. Preferred shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series in the discretion of the
board of directors. The board has the authority to establish the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the
designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. 

 Our
certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors may issue common shares and such may be issued without further
stockholder approval and for such purposes as the board deems in the best interest of our company including future stock splits and split-ups,
stock dividends, equity financings and issuances for acquisitions and business combinations. In addition, such authorized but unissued
common shares could be used by the board of directors for defensive purposes against a hostile takeover attempt, including (by way of
example) the private placement of shares or the granting of options to purchase shares to persons or entities sympathetic to, or contractually
bound to support, management. We have no such present arrangement or understanding with any person. Further, the common and preferred
shares may be reserved for issuance upon exercise of stock purchase rights designed to deter hostile takeovers, commonly known as a poison
pill.

6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

 Not
applicable to a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial
statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Forward-Looking Statements. Our results and the timing of selected
events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its business plan and ultimately to attain profitable
operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern from
a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of
private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. As of November 30, 2022 the Company has issued 244,038,890 shares
of common stock. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

Results
of Operations 

Fiscal
Year Ended November 30, 2022 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2021 

We
earned Nil in revenues for the year ended November 30, 2022 as compared to Nil in revenues for the year ended November 30, 2021. 

Expenses
for the year ended November 30, 2022 totaled 65,792 comprised of Administrative fees of 50,000, Professional fees of 13,764, Brokerage
fees of 2,028 resulting in a net loss of 65,792. Expenses for the year ended November
30, 2021 totaled 57,028 comprised of Administrative fees of 50,000, Professional fees of 5,000, Brokerage fees of 2,028 resulting
in a Net loss of 57,028. 

8 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Our
auditor s report on our November 30, 2022 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether
we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we
believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation
of our business plans. See November 30, 2022 Audited Financial Statements Auditors Report. 

As
of November 30, 2022, we had Nil of cash compared to Nil of cash as of November 30, 2021. We anticipate that our current cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
To date the Company has incurred operating losses since inception of 4,209,778. As at November 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital
deficit of 4,209,778. 

The
Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. Our auditor has expressed
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. 

We
expect to incur professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the Commission.
We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable to obtain
additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans,
financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company intends
to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability to raise capital
as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If
we cannot raise additional funds, we will have to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company s common stock
would lose all of their investment. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on the business, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures and/or capital resources. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation
and uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions
in estimating these cash flows. 

 Our
audit procedures related to the Company s assertion on its ability to continue as a going concern included the following,
among others: 

 We
reviewed the Company s working capital and liquidity ratios and forecasted revenue, operating expenses, and uses and sources of
cash used in management s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from
the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual
results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting management s forecasts, the Company s financing arrangements
in place as of the report date, market and industry factors and consideration of the Company s relationships with its financing
partners.

Going Concern 

 As
described further in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from inception through November 30, 2022 and
expects to incur additional losses in the future. 

 We
determined the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter due to the estimation
and uncertainty regarding the Company s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management s judgments and assumptions

 Going
Concern 

 The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to
the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

 These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

11 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

 Total provision for income taxes 

The
components of our deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: 

Less: valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax assets 

During
the year ended November 30, 2022, the valuation reserve increased compared to an increase of during the year ended November
30, 2021. In assessing the recovery of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that our Company
will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversals of future deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a
result, management determined, as of November 30, 2022, that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. 

As
noted above, we have not filed any federal tax returns, but we plan on bringing our tax filings current as soon as it is practical.

Net
loss in 2020 went down from 161,779 to 82,828. And Net loss in 2021 went from 131,182 to 57,028, due to reversal of depreciation,
reversal of interest expense, adjustment for professional fees, and correction of regulatory expense because of foreign exchange.

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 

 TAAD
LLP communicated to the Company s board of directors that the Company must perform additional internal accounting research and
provide an accurate restatement form to correct the Company s mis-stated Form 10 filed with the SEC. TAAD LLP was notified that
the Company could not perform additional internal accounting research without unreasonable effort and expense. Further, the Company believed
it had presented the footnotes to the financial statements, specifically Note 1 and Note 9, that satisfies the disclosures required by
required by ASC 250-10-50-7 through 50-10. 

Other
than as noted above, during the Company s fiscal years ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2021, the Company has not had any
disagreement with TAAD LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures,
which disagreement, if not resolved to TAAD LLP s satisfaction, would have caused TAAD LLP to make reference to the subject matter
of the disagreement in their reports on the Company s financial statements. 

During
the Company s fiscal years ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2020, there were no other reportable events as
that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. TAAD LLP s report on the Company s financial statements as of
and for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2021 did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,
nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 

On
June 3, 2022, Purthanol Resources Ltd. appointed MICHAEL GILLESPIE ASSOCIATES, PLLC 

 as
the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
connection with this annual report, as required by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company s management, including our company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that as of November 30, 2022 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence
of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s Principal
Executive and Principal Financial officer and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures
that: 

26 

1. 
 Pertains to the maintenance
 of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; 

2. 
 Provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations
 of management and directors; and 

3. 
 Provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material
 effect on our financial statements. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal
control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. As of November 30, 2022, management determined material
weaknesses existed with our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of
outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies
and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these material weaknesses
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of November 30, 2022. 

Material
Weakness Discussion and Remediation 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an eeffect on the Company's previous reported
financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors
on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures could result in the Company s review of its financial statements in the future of being in-effective. 

We
are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent
with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when
funds are available to the Company. This will be achieved by: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who
shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written
policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition, management
believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will
result in proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide
the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turnover issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment
of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. 

27 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer's last fiscal year that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our

with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective
tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director,
nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not
made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would
interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination
is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and
discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management. 

Involvement
in Legal Proceedings 

To
our knowledge, there have been no material legal proceedings during the last ten years that would require disclosure under the federal
securities laws that are material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any of our directors or executive officers. 

Potential
Conflicts of Interest 

We
are not aware of any current or potential conflicts of interest with Mr. Stella, other business interests and his involvement with Purthanol
Resources Limited.

Outstanding
Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End 

We
did not pay any salaries in 2022 and 2021. None of our executive officers received any equity awards, including, options, restricted
stock, performance awards or other equity incentives during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021 for Purthanol
Resoursces Limited. 

E mployment
Contracts 

At
this time, Purthanol Resources Limited has not entered into any employment agreements with its sole officer and director. If there is
sufficient cash flow available from our future operations, the company may enter into employment agreements with our sole officer and
director or future key staff members. 

Stock
Awards Plan 

The
company has not adopted a Stock Awards Plan but may do so in the future. The terms of any such plan have not been determined. 

Director
Compensation 

The
Board of Directors of the Company has not adopted a stock option plan. The company has no plans to adopt it but may choose to do so in
the future. If such a plan is adopted, this may be administered by the board or a committee appointed by the board (the Committee ).
The committee would have the power to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution
therefore, provided that any such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted. Purthanol Resources Limited may
develop an incentive-based stock option plan for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10 of its outstanding shares of common
stock for that purpose. 

The
table below summarizes all compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our directors for all services rendered in all capacities to
us for the period from November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021.

Board
Committees 

We
have not formed an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as of the filing of this
Annual Report. Our Board of Directors performs the principal functions of an Audit Committee. We currently do not have an audit committee
financial expert on our Board of Directors. We believe that an audit committee financial expert is not required because the cost of hiring
an audit committee financial expert to act as one of our directors and to be a member of an Audit Committee outweighs the benefits of
having an audit committee financial expert at this time. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

 The following table sets forth certain information with respect
to the beneficial ownership of our voting securities by (i) each director and named executive officer, (ii) all executive officers and
directors as a group; and (iii) each shareholder known to be the beneficial owner of 5 or more of the outstanding common stock of the
Company as of November 30, 2022 

31 

Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Generally, a person is considered to beneficially own securities: (i)
over which such person, directly or indirectly, exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, and (ii) of which such person has
the right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time within 60 days (such as through exercise of stock options or warrants). For purposes
of computing the percentage of outstanding shares held by each person or group of persons, any shares that such person or persons has
the right to acquire within 60 days of November 30, 2022 are deemed to be outstanding but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose
of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The inclusion herein of any shares listed as beneficially owned does not constitute
an admission of beneficial ownership.

SEC requires that before our independent registered public accounting firm is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit
related service, the engagement be either: (i) approved by our Audit Committee or (ii) entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies
and procedures established by the Audit Committee, provided that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service,
the Audit Committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee s
responsibilities to management. 

We
do not have an Audit Committee. Our Board pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. All
of the above services and fees paid for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were pre-approved by our Board.
