 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, future capital expenditures; business strategies; goals, beliefs, plans, and objectives; competitive strengths; market developments; development and operation of facilities; growth in sales volume; meeting capacity requirements; expansion of service to existing customers and service to new customers; future environmental regulations and remediation liabilities; electric customer credits; and the anticipated outcome of various regulatory and legal proceedings. Although the Registrants believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions (some of which may prove to be incorrect) and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the Registrants expectations. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with these forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following list identifies some of the factors that could cause the Registrants actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any of the Registrants forward-looking statements: 
 
 changes in environmental laws, regulations, decisions and policies, including present and potential environmental remediation costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, possible effects on Cleco s generation resources, or prohibitions or restrictions on new or existing services, and Cleco s compliance with these matters, 
 state and federal regulatory decisions or related judicial decisions disallowing or delaying recovery of capital investments, operating costs, commodity costs, and the ordering of refunds to customers and discretion over allowed return on investment, 
 the loss of regulatory accounting treatment, which could result in the write-off of regulatory assets and the loss of regulatory deferral and recovery mechanisms, 
 economic, regulatory, or workforce impacts related to pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks, 
 economic impacts related to conflicts and hostilities, including the current armed conflict in Ukraine, 
 the possibility of stranded costs with respect to assets that may be retired as a result of new climate legislation, technological advances, a shift in demand, or legal action, and Cleco Power s ability to recover stranded costs associated with these events, 
 changes in climate and weather conditions, including natural disasters such as wind and ice storms, hurricanes, floods, and droughts, and Cleco Power s ability to recover restoration and stranded costs associated with these events, 
 the ability of Cleco s customers to pay their utility bills on time due to costs related to rising fuel prices, severe weather recoveries, or the costs of other events that are passed through to Cleco Power s customers, 

economic conditions in Cleco s service areas, including inflation and the economy s effects on customer demand for and payment of utility services, 
 Cleco s ability to recontract existing power purchase agreements or secure future power purchase agreements with wholesale customers, 
 mechanical breakdowns or other incidents that could impair assets and disrupt operations of any of Cleco s generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, or other operations and may require Cleco to purchase replacement power or incur costs to repair the facilities, 
 growth or decline of Cleco s customer base, or decline in existing services, including the loss of key suppliers for fuel, materials, or services, or other disruptions to the supply chain, 
 wholesale and retail competition, including alternative energy sources, growth in customer-owned power resource technologies that displace utility-supplied energy or that may be sold back to the utility, and alternative energy suppliers and delivery arrangements, 
 blackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems (the regional power grid), 
 terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, or other malicious acts that may damage or disrupt operating or information technology systems, 
 changes in technology costs that impede Cleco s ability to effectively implement new information systems or to operate and maintain current production technology, 
 changes in Cleco s strategic business plans and/or key initiatives, which could be affected by any of the factors discussed herein, 
 the impact of Cleco s credit ratings, changes in interest rates, other capital market conditions, and global market conditions on financing through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, 
 failure to meet expectations and report progress on ESG initiatives and GHG targets, as well as the increased focus on and activism related to ESG, which could limit Cleco s access to capital and/or financing, 
 declining energy demand related to customer energy efficiency, conservation measures, technological advancements, or increased distributed generation, 
 industry and geographic concentrations of Cleco s counterparties, suppliers, and customers, 
 volatility and illiquidity in wholesale energy markets,

 Cleco s ability to remain in compliance with the commitments made to the LPSC in connection with the Cleco Cajun Transaction and the 2016 Merger, 
 Cleco Holdings dependence on the earnings, dividends, or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations, and 
 workforce factors, including aging workforce, changes in key members of management, availability of workers in a variety of skill areas, and Cleco s ability to attract, recruit, and retain qualified employees.

 Cleco Power s generation dispatch and transmission operations are integrated with MISO. The amount of power generated by Cleco Power is dictated by the availability of Cleco Power s generating fleet and the manner in which MISO dispatches each generating unit. Depending on how generating units are dispatched by MISO, the amount of power generated may be greater than or less than total energy requirements. Generating units are dispatched by referencing each unit s economic efficiency as it relates to the overall MISO market. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 

and Results of Operations Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Transmission Rates. 
 
 Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Changes in fuel expenses reflect fluctuations in the amount, type, and pricing of fuel used for electric generation; fuel transportation and delivery costs; and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through Cleco Power s FAC in subsequent months. Changes in purchased power expenses are a result of the quantity and price of economic power purchased from the MISO market. These quantity changes can be affected by Cleco plant outages and plant performance. For a discussion of certain risks associated with changes in fuel costs and their impact on utility customers, see Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Transmission Constraints and Regulatory Risks LPSC Audits.

 Power Purchases 
 Cleco Power is a participant in the MISO market. MISO makes economic and routine dispatch decisions regarding Cleco Power s generating units. Power purchases are made at prevailing market prices, also referred to as LMP. LMP includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have higher LMPs. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power s pricing zones. For information on Cleco Power s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses, see Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises Rates. For information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Transmission Rates. 
 
 Coal, Petroleum Coke, and Lignite Supply 
 Cleco Power uses coal for generation at Rodemacher Unit 2. On January 1, 2022, Cleco Power contracted with a supplier to provide Cleco Power s coal needs at Rodemacher Unit 2, utilizing a two-year, fixed-price, coal agreement expiring on December 31, 2023. For 2023, Cleco Power intends to meet its coal needs through this coal agreement and one other short-term, fixed-price coal agreement. In 2022, Cleco Power had an agreement to transport coal from Wyoming s Powder River Basin to Rodemacher Unit 2. This agreement was renewed on January 1, 2023, for an additional three years, expiring on December 31, 2025. During 2021, Cleco Power renewed its lease for 113 railcars to transport its coal under one lease, which expires on March 31, 2024. 
 The continuous supply of coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power s coal inventory at Rodemacher Unit 2 was approximately 109,000 tons (approximately a 45-day supply). 
 Cleco Power uses a combination of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal for generation at Madison Unit 3. Petroleum coke is a by-product of the oil refinery process and is not considered a fuel specifically produced for a market; however, ample petroleum coke supplies are produced from refineries each year throughout the world, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. The price of petroleum coke is largely driven by the demand for the fuel and the related transportation costs. During 2022, Cleco Power received its petroleum coke supply from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River. Cleco Power purchased approximately 722,000 tons of petroleum coke during 2022, all of which were either an evergreen extension of a previous agreement or a negotiated agreement for one year ending on December 31, 2022. Cleco Power has one-year agreements, expiring on December 31, 2023, to purchase 779,000 tons of petroleum 

coke from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River. 
 During 2022, Cleco Power purchased approximately 202,000 tons of Illinois Basin coal. Cleco Power uses Louisiana waterways, such as the Mississippi River and the Red River, to deliver both petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal to the Madison Unit 3 plant site. The continuous supply of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. On January 1, 2023, Cleco Power contracted with a supplier to provide Cleco Power s coal needs at Madison Unit 3 utilizing a two-year, fixed-price, coal agreement expiring on December 31, 2024. For 2023, Cleco Power intends to meet its petroleum coke needs through three one-year, fixed-price petroleum coke agreements. Cleco Power has a logistics agreement with its primary transportation coordinator and provider that is set to expire in March 2033. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power s petroleum coke inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 211,000 tons, and Cleco Power s Illinois Basin coal inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 70,000 tons. The total fuel inventory was 281,000 tons (approximately a 47-day supply).

 Cleco Power owns natural gas pipelines and interconnections at all of its natural gas generating facilities that allow it to access various natural gas supply markets and maintain a reliable, economical fuel supply for its customers. 
 Although natural gas prices were elevated and extremely volatile during 2022, natural gas was available without interruption throughout the year. Cleco Power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily, monthly, and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers. Natural gas prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions. During 2022 Cleco Power contracted for natural 

11 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 gas firm transportation with two interstate pipelines. One pipeline contract is for a period of two years ending October 31, 2024, and the other is for six months ending May 31, 2023. 
 Cleco Power also uses underground salt dome gas storage to help mitigate supply disruptions to its generating facilities and to operationally balance gas supply to its units. The storage volume is contracted by paying a capacity reservation charge at a fixed rate. There are also variable charges incurred to withdraw and inject gas from storage. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had 1.2 million MMBtu of gas in storage. Currently, Cleco Power anticipates that its diverse supply options and gas storage, combined with its solid-fuel generation resources, are adequate to meet its generation needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies. 
 
 Sales 
 Cleco Power s 2022 and 2021 system peak demands, which occurred on December 24, 2022, and February 16, 2021, were 2,695 MW and 2,645 MW, respectively. Sales and system peak demand are affected by weather and are typically highest during the summer air-conditioning season; however, peaks may occur during the winter season as well. For information on the effects of future energy sales on Cleco Power s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, see Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Future Electricity Sales and Weather Sensitivity. 
 Reserve margin is the net capacity resources (either owned or purchased) less native load demand, divided by native load demand. Members of MISO submit their forecasted native load demand to MISO each year. During 2022, Cleco Power s reserve margin was 9.1 , which was above MISO s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 8.7 . During 2021, Cleco Power s reserve margin was 22.5 , which was also above MISO s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 9.4 . Cleco Power plans on meeting its planning reserve margin requirements in 2023 as MISO transitions from a traditional annual unforced capacity value to a seasonal accreditation capacity value. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Transmission Rates. 
 
 Customers and Competition 
 During 2022 and 2021, Cleco Power had one wholesale customer that accounted for 10.8 and 10.6 , respectively, of its consolidated revenue. In 2021 through a request for proposal process, this significant wholesale customer informed Cleco Power it was not selected as a provider of capacity and 

energy after the first quarter of 2024, and on October 19, 2022, the LPSC certified these results. Cleco Power s failure to recontract this agreement is expected to affect jurisdictional retail rates that will be subject to review by the LPSC in conjunction with Cleco Power s next rate case, expected to be effective July 1, 2024. 
 Cleco Power did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10 or more of its consolidated revenue in 2020. 
 During 2022, 2021, or 2020, Cleco Power did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10 or more of Cleco s consolidated revenue. 
 For more information regarding Cleco Power s sales and revenue, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations. 
 Within MISO, competitors are typically comprised of investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, power marketers, and power plant developers. These entities typically compete on the basis of price, reliability, and residual risk to the purchasing customer and its end users . Cleco Power could experience some competition for electric sales to industrial customers in the form of cogeneration and from alternative and distributed energy power sources. 
 The LPSC s consideration of adopting minimum physical capacity threshold requirements for load serving entities could materially impact Cleco Power s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Management is unable to determine the timing and outcome of a final LPSC ruling.

 Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Cleco Cajun uses coal and natural gas for its power generation resources. Cleco Cajun procures these fuels under contracts from a variety of suppliers and transporters. Cleco Cajun maintains an inventory of coal supply on-site at its coal generating facilities. 
 
 Sales 
 Cleco Cajun sells wholesale electric supply in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. It furnishes supply to its wholesale customers primarily through all-requirements power supply and service agreements, which require Cleco Cajun to provide the electric capacity, energy, and other services necessary to serve most of its customers load requirements. Cleco Cajun procures the entirety of the power required to fulfill these obligations through its participation in the MISO market, and sells the entirety of power produced from its generating plants to the MISO market. 
 Cleco Cajun s business experiences seasonality, as it bills its customers based on actual electric energy consumed. This usage tends to be greater during periods of high and low temperatures as compared to periods of moderate temperatures. 
 
 Customers and Competition 
 Competition for Cleco Cajun s electric cooperative customers is limited through the first quarter of 2025, when the majority of the wholesale electric supply contracts expire. Cleco Cajun s cooperative customers have notified Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider beyond the first quarter of 2025. The regulatory certification process for new supply contracts has been finalized by the LPSC for all but three cooperative customers. This non-selection is believed to be the result of a trend toward cooperatives favoring shorter-term, market-based solutions and intermittent renewables rather than asset-backed, long-term full-service contracts. Cleco Cajun s failure to recontract these agreements could have a material adverse effect on Cleco's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows as early as the second quarter of 2025. Cleco is exploring options related to its investment in Cleco Cajun, including the potential sale of part or all of Cleco Cajun s assets. 
 Cleco Cajun did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10 or more of Cleco s consolidated revenue in 2022, 2021, or 2020.

 Prior to July 1, 2021, Cleco Power s annual retail earnings were subject to an FRP established by the LPSC in June 2014. The 2014 FRP allowed Cleco Power to earn a target ROE of 10.0 , while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.9 . Additionally, 60.0 of retail earnings between 10.9 and 11.75 , and all retail earnings over 11.75 , were required to be refunded to customers. On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s current FRP. Effective July 1, 2021, under the terms of the current FRP, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 9.5 , while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.0 . Additionally, 60.0 of retail earnings between 10.0 and 10.5 and all retail earnings over 10.5 are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC annually. Credits are typically included on customers bills the following summer, but the amount and timing of the refunds are ultimately subject to LPSC approval. Cleco Power s next base rate case is required to be filed with the LPSC on or before March 31, 2023. For more information on the current FRP, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 13 Regulation and Rates FRP. 
 From June 1, 2021, through August 31, 2022, Cleco Power recovered from retail customers certain incurred costs associated with Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta through an interim storm recovery rate. Effective September 1, 2022, those costs are being recovered through a new storm recovery surcharge resulting from the storm recovery securitization financing. For more information, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 19 Securitization. 
 Generally, Cleco Power s cost of fuel used for electric generation and the cost of purchased power are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC that enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. For more information on the FAC and the most recent fuel audits, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Fuel Audits. 
 Cleco Power has an EAC that is used to recover from its customers certain costs of environmental compliance. These costs are subject to periodic review by the LPSC.

Franchises 
 Cleco Power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units, such as municipalities and parishes (counties), and enforced by state law. These franchises are for fixed terms that vary in length. Historically, Cleco Power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each neared the end of its term.

 For information on developments and competition within the electric utility industry, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Market Structure. 
 
 Legislative and Regulatory Changes and Matters 
 Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry. Such issues include, among others: 
 
 the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs, 
 the role of electric utilities, independent power producers, and competitive bidding in the purchase, construction, and operation of new generating capacity, 
 the role of electric utilities and independent transmission providers in competitive bidding in the construction of new transmission facilities, 
 the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility s transmission system, or the cost of transmission services provided by an RTO/ISO, 
 FERC s assessment of market power and a utility s ability to buy generation assets, 
 mandatory transmission reliability standards, 
 NERC s imposition of additional reliability and cybersecurity standards, 
 the authority of FERC to grant utilities the power of eminent domain, 
 increasing requirements for renewable energy sources, 
 demand response and energy efficiency standards, 
 comprehensive environmental regulation in the areas of air, water, and waste, 
 FERC s ability to impose financial penalties, and 
 the LPSC s consideration of adopting minimum physical capacity threshold requirements for load serving entities. 
 
 At this time, management is unable to predict the outcome of such issues or the effects thereof on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 
 Environmental Quality 
 Cleco is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties. Cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations, and management believes Cleco is in compliance in all material 

14 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 respects with these permits, as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental requirements affecting electric power facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time as a result of new legislation, administrative actions, and judicial interpretations. Therefore, the capital costs and other expenditures necessary to comply with existing and new environmental requirements are difficult to determine. Cleco Power may request recovery of the costs to comply with certain environmental laws and regulations from its retail customers. If recovery were to be approved by the LPSC, then Cleco Power s retail rates could increase. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, then Cleco Power would bear those costs directly. Such a decision could negatively impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For information on Cleco Power s expected capital expenditures related to environmental compliance, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Generation and Cash Requirements Capital Expenditures. 
 
 Air Quality 
 Air emissions from each of Cleco s generating units are strictly regulated by the EPA and the LDEQ. The LDEQ has authority over and implements certain air quality programs established by the EPA under the federal CAA, as well as its own air quality regulations. The LDEQ establishes standards of performance and requires permits for EGUs in Louisiana. All of Cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements. 
 The EPA has proposed and adopted rules under the authority of the CAA relevant to the emissions of SO 2 and NO x from Cleco s generating units. 
 
 Regional Haze SIP 
 The CAA contains a regional haze program with the goal of returning Class I Federal areas of the nation to natural visibility by 2064. States are required to develop a SIP and revise it every ten years. The SIP must include requirements for the installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for applicable EGUs in Louisiana. The EPA issued a final approval of the Louisiana SIP for the first planning phase in December 2017. Although the approval was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by multiple organizations, the court denied all the challenges to the EPA s approval of the Louisiana Regional Haze SIP. Because the Louisiana SIP mandates use of existing controls and participation in the CSAPR as BART, Cleco does not believe the Louisiana SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The second planning period for the regional haze program covers the period from 2018 through 2028 and requires states to adopt SIPs that make reasonable further progress toward achieving natural visibility conditions in Class I Federal areas. The LDEQ published a proposed SIP for the second planning period in April 2021 for public comment and it may be subject to revision upon further review by the LDEQ before it is submitted to the EPA. The proposal does not call for new controls on any state sources, but instead, it relies upon existing consent decrees and expected source retirements to achieve reasonable progress in reducing emissions and improving visibility in Class I Federal areas. The SIP for the second planning phase has not been submitted to the EPA. The EPA 

published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2022, the finding that Louisiana and fourteen other states failed to submit a regional haze SIP for the second planning period. The EPA must issue a federal implementation plan within two years of the effective date of this finding if a SIP is not provided by LDEQ before then. Until the LDEQ determines what the reasonable progress requirements are for Cleco units and completes its update of the SIP and the EPA approves the SIP, Cleco is unable to predict if the second phase SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Acid Rain Program 
 The CAA also established the Acid Rain Program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on acid rain-causing SO 2 emissions from certain generating units. The CAA requires all of the regulated EGUs to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of SO 2 emitted beginning in 2000. The EPA allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions. Cleco had sufficient allowances for operations in 2022 and expects to have sufficient allowances for 2023 operations under the Acid Rain Program. 
 The Acid Rain Program also established emission rate limits on NO x emissions for certain generating units. Compliance with the acid rain emission limits for NO x has been achieved at all affected facilities. 
 
 CSAPR 
 In October 2016, the EPA published the finalized CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS in the Federal Register (CSAPR Update Rule). As a result, the EPA proposed Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) that update the EGU CSAPR NO X ozone season emission budgets and implemented the budgets through the existing CSAPR NO X ozone season allowance trading program. The FIP required implementation beginning with the 2017 ozone season. 
 On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially remanded the CSAPR Update Rule to the EPA because the rule did not set a deadline by which upwind states must eliminate their significant contribution to downwind states NAAQS nonattainment. On April 30, 2021, the EPA issued in the Federal Register the final revised CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Cleco does not expect the final regulation to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow of the Registrants. 
 In October 2015, the EPA promulgated a revision to the 2015 ozone NAAQS, lowering the level of both the primary and secondary standards to 70 ppb. Under the CAA, each state is required to submit a SIP that provides for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each primary and secondary NAAQS. In particular, each SIP must contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions activity within the state, which will contribute significantly to non-attainment or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any such primary or secondary ambient air quality standard. On October 15, 2021, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed consent decree that would establish a deadline for the EPA to approve or disapprove good neighbor SIP submittals by April 30, 2022, for a number of states including Louisiana. On January 12, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered the final consent decree and on February 22, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed disapproval of the good neighbor SIP submitted by Louisiana 

15 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 for the 2015 ozone NAAQS. On April 6, 2022, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed federal implementation plan (FIP) that if finalized would be applied to address the good neighbor requirements for the 2015 ozone NAAQS for those states that do not have an approved SIP. If the EPA finalizes its proposed disapproval of the Louisiana SIP, the EPA would apply a finalized FIP to address the good neighbor provision for Louisiana for the 2015 ozone NAAQS, which might result in the allocation of fewer emission allowances to generating units and may cause Cleco to buy additional allowances and/or take other measures to comply. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the outcome of the EPA s decision regarding the good neighbor provision. 
 
 MATS 
 For information about MATS, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Environmental Audit. 
 
 CPP/ACE and NSPS 
 In August 2015, the EPA released the final guidelines referred to as the CPP. These guidelines provided each state with standards for CO 2 emissions from the existing units of the state s utility industry. The EPA derived the limits for each state through a strategy involving a combination of unit efficiency improvements, dispatching away from boilers to combined cycle units, and applying renewable energy. The CPP required significant reductions of CO 2 emissions and set interim and final CO 2 emission goals for each state. The interim emission goals were scheduled to begin in 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP to remain in place until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the merits and any ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. 
 In August 2015, the EPA released the NSPS rules for CO 2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. The rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO 2 emission standards for new units and those that are modified or reconstructed. Cleco does not anticipate a modification or reconstruction of its existing sources that would trigger the application of the CO 2 emission limits. 
 In March 2017, the executive order of Energy Independence was issued. Among other measures, the order directed the EPA to review the CPP, the proposed Federal Implementation Plan for the CPP, and the GHG NSPS. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule repealing the CPP and issuing a replacement to the CPP, informally known as the ACE Rule. The ACE Rule requires state agencies to set standards of performance for each affected generating unit and submit the implementation plan to the EPA for approval by July 8, 2022, with compliance expected within 24 months thereafter. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EPA s repeal of the CPP and its 2019 promulgation of ACE were unlawful. Therefore, the court issued an order to vacate and remand the ACE Rule to the EPA. On February 22, 2021, the court granted the EPA s unopposed motion for a partial stay of the issuance of the mandate on vacating the CPP repeal, ordering that it will withhold issuance of the mandate with respect to the vacatur of the CPP repeal until the EPA responds to the court s remand by promulgating a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from 

existing electric generating units. Therefore, the CPP will not take effect during the EPA s rulemaking process. In addition, on March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the partial mandate effectuating the court s vacatur of the ACE Rule that makes effective the court s decision to vacate the ACE Rule. In April 2021, multiple parties filed petitions for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for certiorari asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review its decision to vacate and remand the ACE Rule. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court released its opinion on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacating and remanding the ACE rule. The U.S. Supreme Court indicated in its opinion that the EPA does not have the authority to apply generation shifting in the regulation of GHG emissions as in the CPP. The case was returned to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is expected that the EPA will issue a new GHG rule taking the Court s opinion into consideration. 
 On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration issued an executive order directing federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a non-exhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the ACE Rule. Until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion has been determined to be final and the EPA has responded to the court s opinion and the executive order to review the ACE Rule, management cannot determine the future regulatory requirements for GHGs for the utility industry and the potential impact on Cleco s existing affected units. However, any new rules that require significant reductions in CO 2 emissions for existing EGUs could require significant capital expenditures or curtailment of operations of certain EGUs to achieve compliance. 
 In December 2018, the EPA published proposed rules to replace the August 2015 NSPS rules for CO 2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. As with the current NSPS rules, the proposed rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO 2 emission standards for new, modified, or reconstructed units. Cleco does not anticipate a future modification or future reconstruction of its existing units, as defined in the proposal, which would trigger the application of the proposed CO 2 emission limits. Until the EPA finalizes the rule, management cannot state what the final standards will entail or if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 NAAQS 
 A primary NAAQS for NO 2 promulgated by the EPA became effective in April 2010. The EPA established a new one-hour standard at a level of 100 ppb to supplement the existing annual standard. In 2012, the EPA determined that no area in the country was violating the standard. In April 2018, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for NO 2 . The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of NO 2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their NO 2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new 

16 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time. 
 The EPA revised the NAAQS for SO 2 in June 2010. The new standard is now a one-hour health standard of 75 ppb, designed to reduce short-term exposures to SO 2 ranging from five minutes to 24 hours. An important aspect of the new SO 2 standard is a revised emission monitoring network combined with a new ambient air modeling approach to determine compliance with the new standard. In January 2018, the EPA published a final rule designating all areas containing Cleco generation facilities as either attainment/unclassifiable or unclassifiable. Therefore, there is no adverse impact to Cleco s generating units. 
 On March 18, 2019, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for SO 2 . The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of SO 2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their SO 2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time. 
 On December 21, 2020, after a required review, the EPA published a final rule that retains the NAAQS for ozone, which was last revised in 2015. Cleco s generation facilities are not located in areas designated as nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS. 
 
 Other 
 On May 2, 2019, Louisiana Generating notified the EPA and the LDEQ that it has elected not to Retrofit (as such term is defined in the Consent Decree) Big Cajun II, Unit 1. 
 On December 15, 2022, Louisiana Generating notified the EPA and the LDEQ that it had elected to Refuel (as such term is defined in the Consent Decree) Big Cajun II, Unit 1, in accordance with certain provisions of the Consent Decree. 
 
 Water Quality 
 Cleco s facilities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding wastewater discharges. Cleco has received, from the EPA and the LDEQ, permits required under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for wastewater discharges from its generating stations. Wastewater discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration, and Cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods. 
 In March 2011, the EPA proposed regulations that would establish standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to Section 316(b) of the CWA. The EPA published its final rule in August 2014. The standards are intended to protect fish and other aquatic wildlife by minimizing capture, both in screens attached to intake structures (impingement mortality) and in the actual intake structures themselves (entrainment mortality). The final rule (1) sets a performance standard, dealing with fish impingement mortality or reducing the flow velocity at cooling water intakes to less than 0.5 feet per second and (2) requires entrainment standards to be determined on a case-by-case basis by state-delegated permitting authorities. Facilities subject to the standards are required to complete a number of studies within a 45-month period and then comply with the rule as soon as possible after the next discharge permit renewal, by a date determined by the permitting authorities. Portions of 

the final rule could apply to a number of Cleco s fossil fuel steam electric generating stations. Until the required studies are conducted, including technical and economic evaluations of the control options available, and regulatory agency officials have reviewed the studies and made determinations, Cleco remains uncertain as to which technology options or retrofits will be required to be installed on its affected facilities. The costs of required technology options and retrofits may be significant, particularly if closed cycle cooling is required. 
 The CWA requires the EPA to periodically review and, if appropriate, revise technology-based effluent limitations guidelines for categories of industrial facilities, including power generating facilities. In November 2015, the EPA released the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category Rule (ELG Rule). The rule is focused on reducing the discharge of metals in wastewater from generating facilities to surface waters. 
 On October 13, 2020, the EPA published final revisions to the ELG Rule that revised the technology-based effluent limitation guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization and bottom ash transport waste waters. The revised ELG Rule, known as the Reconsideration Rule, also allows a unit to come into compliance with the ELG Rule by qualifying as an electric generating unit that will achieve permanent cessation of coal combustion by December 31, 2028. Under this compliance option, Cleco submitted a Notice of Planned Participation by the October 13, 2021, submittal deadline for the Dolet Hills Power Station, Rodemacher Unit 2, and Big Cajun II, Unit 1. 
 On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration released a non-exhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the ELG Rule. 
 
 Solid Waste Disposal 
 In the course of operations, Cleco s facilities generate solid and hazardous waste materials requiring eventual disposal. The Solid Waste Division of the LDEQ has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations. Cleco has received all required permits from the LDEQ for the on-site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations. 
 In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants (CCR Rule). The CCR Rule establishes extensive requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated several requirements in the CCR Rule, which included eliminating the previous acceptability of compacted clay material as a liner for impoundments. As a result, in December 2019, the EPA published a proposed rule that would set deadlines for costly modifications including retrofitting of clay-lined impoundments with compliant liners or closure of the impoundments. The CCR Rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2020. In November 2020, Cleco submitted demonstrations to the EPA specifying its intended course of action for the ash disposal facilities at Rodemacher Unit 2, Dolet Hills Power Station, and Big Cajun II in order to comply with the final CCR Rule. On January 11, 2022, the EPA communicated that Cleco s demonstrations have been 

17 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 deemed complete, subject to the EPA s approval based on pending technical reviews. During the third quarter of 2022, Cleco ceased placing all CCR and non-CCR waste streams in the bottom ash impoundments at the Dolet Hills Power Station. A Notice of Intent to Close was posted on the Dolet Hills CCR website, updated closure plans were submitted to the LDEQ, and Cleco notified the EPA that it withdrew its Part A demonstration for the Dolet Hill s impoundments. 
 On January 20, 2021, the Presidential administration released a nonexhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the CCR rules promulgated in July 2018, August 2020, and November 2020. The EPA has completed its review of the three CCR rules and has determined that the most environmentally protective course is to implement the rules. 
 As a result of solid waste disposal regulations, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun have AROs for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities. All costs of the CCR Rule for Cleco Power are expected to be recovered from its customers in future rates. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR Rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. Cleco will continue to gather additional data in future periods and will make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities. As additional information becomes available and management makes decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities, Cleco will update the ARO balances to reflect these changes in estimates. For more information on Cleco s compliance strategies and financial impacts of the CCR Rule, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Other Commitments. For more information on the regulatory treatment of Cleco Power s AROs, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities AROs. 
 In December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), including the WIIN Act s provisions regarding CCRs, was signed into law. The WIIN Act s CCR provisions require the EPA to establish a CCR permitting program. It also allows for implementation of the federal CCR Rule through a state-based permit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule establishing the federal permit program. Permits will be required for all CCR units in states that do not have state permit programs. Until the state of Louisiana has evaluated the WIIN Act and made a decision on implementing a state-based option, Cleco cannot determine if there will be a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its electric generating stations and at other locations. Cleco does not treat, store long-term, or dispose of these wastes on-site; therefore, no permits are required. Hazardous wastes produced by Cleco are properly disposed of at permitted hazardous waste disposal sites. 
 
 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) 
 The TSCA directs the EPA to regulate the marketing, disposing, manufacturing, processing, distributing in 

commerce, and usage of various toxic substances, including PCBs. Cleco operates and may continue to operate equipment containing PCBs under the TSCA. Once the equipment reaches the end of its useful life, the EPA regulates handling and disposing of the equipment and fluids containing PCBs. Within these regulations, handling and disposing is allowed only through facilities approved and permitted by the EPA. Cleco properly disposes of its PCB waste material at TSCA-permitted disposal facilities. 
 
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) 
 The CERCLA imposes liability on parties responsible for, in whole or in part, the presence of hazardous substances at a site. In 2007, Cleco received a Special Notice for Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) from the EPA for a facility known as the Devil s Swamp Lake site located just northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The notice requested that Cleco and Cleco Power, along with many other listed potentially responsible parties (PRP), enter into negotiations with the EPA for the performance of an RI/FS at the Devil s Swamp Lake site. In 2008, the EPA identified Cleco as one of many companies that sent PCB wastes for disposal to the site. The EPA proposed to add the Devil s Swamp Lake site to the National Priorities List, based on the release of PCBs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site, but no final listing decision has been made. The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to two PRPs, Clean Harbors, Inc. and Baton Rouge Disposal, to conduct an RI/FS in 2009. The Tier 1 part of the study was completed in June 2012. The tier 2 remedial investigation report was made public in December 2015. In September 2019, the EPA publicly announced a proposed cleanup strategy for the Superfund Site. In August 2020, the EPA signed a Record of Decision for the Devil s Swamp Lake site that defines a remediation approach for cleaning up the site and monitoring the natural recovery of certain areas of the lake. With the Record of Decision signed, the EPA has started the enforcement negotiations for the next phase of the project. Management is unable to determine how significant Cleco s share of the costs associated with a possible response action at the site, if any, may be and whether this will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) 
 Section 313 of the EPCRA requires certain facilities that manufacture, process, or otherwise use minimum quantities of listed toxic chemicals to file an annual report with the EPA called a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) report. The TRI report requires industrial facilities to report on approximately 650 substances that the facilities release into the air, water, and land. The TRI report ranks companies based on the amount of a particular substance they release on a state and parish (county) level. Annual reports are due to the EPA on July 1 following the reporting year-end. Cleco has submitted required TRI reports on its activities, and the TRI rankings are available to the public. The rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties. 
 
 Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs) 
 The possibility that exposure to EMFs emanating from electric power lines, household appliances, and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects and damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention.

The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Registrants. 
 
 STRUCTURAL RISKS 
 
 Holding Company 
 
 Cleco Holdings is a holding company and its ability to meet its debt obligations is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries. 
 Cleco Holdings is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Cleco Holdings ability to meet its debt obligations is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries. Cleco Holdings subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligations to pay any amounts due on Cleco Holdings debt or to make any funds available for such payment. In addition, Cleco Holdings subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to Cleco Holdings may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors. Substantially all of Cleco s consolidated assets are held by either Cleco Power or Cleco Cajun. Cleco Holdings right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Cleco Holdings were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary ranking senior to that held by Cleco Holdings. Cleco Power is subject to regulation by the LPSC. The 2016 Merger Commitments also provide for limitations on the amount of distributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings. 
 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 
 Future Electricity Sales 
 
 Cleco Power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows and Cleco Cajun s future wholesale revenue and cash flows could be negatively affected by adverse macroeconomic conditions. 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions resulting in low economic growth can negatively impact the businesses of Cleco Power s residential, commercial, wholesale, and industrial customers, and Cleco Cajun s wholesale customers resulting in decreased power consumption, which causes a corresponding decrease in base revenue for Cleco Power and revenue for Cleco Cajun. Reduced production or the shutdown of customer facilities 

could substantially reduce Cleco Power s base revenue and Cleco Cajun s revenue. 
 
 Energy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other factors that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed or introduced requirements and incentives to reduce energy consumption. Conservation and energy efficiency programs are designed to reduce energy demand. Future electricity sales could be impacted by customers switching to alternative sources of energy, such as solar and wind, on-site power generation, and retail customers purchasing less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or expanded energy efficiency measures. Declining usage could result in an under-recovery of fixed costs at Cleco Power s rate regulated business. An increase in energy conservation, energy efficiency efforts, and other efforts that reduce energy demand could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Weather Sensitivity 
 
 Cleco s operations and power generation could be harmed due to the impact of severe weather events, other natural disasters, or climate change, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Severe weather, including hurricanes, winter storms, tropical storms, and other natural disasters, such as floods, can affect transportation of fuel to plant sites and can be destructive, causing outages, blackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems, and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenue, and additional capital restoration costs. Extreme drought conditions can impact the availability of cooling water to support the operations of generating plants, which can also result in additional expenses and lower revenue. Extreme weather conditions could also increase commodity prices, including fuel, which could have a material adverse effect on Cleco s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 Climate change that results in more frequent and more severe weather events in Cleco s service territory, could result in one or more physical risks, such as an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding, and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and potential increased impacts of extreme winter weather conditions, including ice storms, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The Registrants assets are in and serve communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. In addition, a significant portion of the nation s oil and gas infrastructure is 

19 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 located in these areas and is susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. 
 For example, during 2020 and 2021, Cleco s service territory sustained substantial damage from four separate hurricanes and two winter storms that resulted in damage to Cleco Power s distribution and transmission assets, electricity generation supply shortages, natural gas supply shortages, increases in prices of natural gas in the U.S., and significant outages for Cleco Power s customers. 
 Any future severe weather, other natural disaster, or physical changes resulting from climate change could cause damage to, or the loss of, Cleco s equipment and facilities, which could result in Cleco incurring additional costs, such as the cost to restore service, repair damaged facilities, or obtain replacement power. Any future severe weather, other natural disaster, or physical changes resulting from climate change could also result in changes in demand for and usage of electricity in Cleco s service territory and the service territory of Cleco s wholesale customers. The delivery of equipment and supplies necessary to Cleco s business could also be disrupted. Cleco Power s recovery of costs associated with these events is subject to LPSC review and approval, and the LPSC could disallow timely and full recovery of the costs incurred. These risks and other possible effects of severe weather, other natural disasters, and climate change could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 The operating results of Cleco are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. 
 Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity, particularly with respect to residential customers. In Cleco s service territory, demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months. As a result, Cleco s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In addition, Cleco has sold less power and, consequently, earned less income when weather conditions were milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Workforce 
 
 Failure to attract, retain, and develop an appropriately qualified workforce could have a negative impact on business operations and a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Certain events, such as employee resignations and retirements, labor shortages, wage inflation, an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a lack of equivalent or enhanced skill sets to fulfill future needs, or unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, difficulty in finding highly-skilled, qualified candidates, specifically due to the location of Cleco s corporate office and potential employee relocation challenges even with a hybrid work option, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Costs may increase as a result of contractors replacing employees, productivity slowdown, and safety incidents. Failure to hire and adequately develop replacement employees, maintain an inclusive work environment, transfer functional knowledge and expertise to 

the next generation of employees, ensure the availability of skilled new hires, or accept hybrid or remote work options may adversely affect the ability to manage and safely operate the Registrants business. If the Registrants are unable to successfully attract, retain, and develop an appropriately qualified workforce, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Technology and Terrorism Threats 
 
 The operational and information technology systems on which Cleco relies to conduct its business and serve customers could fail to function properly due to technological problems, cyberattacks, physical attacks on Cleco s assets, acts of terrorism, severe weather, solar events, electromagnetic events, natural disasters, the age and condition of information technology assets, human error, or other reasons that could disrupt Cleco s operations and cause Cleco to incur unanticipated losses and expense. 
 The operation of Cleco s extensive electrical systems relies on evolving operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming extremely complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to more safely and reliably deliver electric services. Cleco s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a real-time daily basis, a large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex. Cleco s hybrid remote working environment makes protecting distributed assets more challenging, and there is a greater opportunity for successful cyberattacks. The failure of Cleco s operational and information technology systems and networks due to a physical attack, cyberattack, or other event would significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; result in damage to Cleco s assets or operations, or those of third parties; and subject Cleco to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco s systems, including its financial information, operational, advanced metering, and billing systems, require constant maintenance, monitoring, security patches, modification or configuration of systems, and update and upgrade of systems, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the modification, transition to, or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management s and employees attention and resources, and could adversely affect the effectiveness of Cleco s control environment, and/or its ability to accurately or timely file required regulatory reports. 
 Despite implementation of security and mitigation measures, Cleco s technology systems and those of Cleco s vendors are vulnerable to inoperability, impaired operations, or failures due to physical attacks or cyberattacks on the facilities and equipment needed to operate the technology systems, viruses, human errors, acts of war or terrorism, and other events. If Cleco s or its vendor s information technology systems or network infrastructure were to fail, Cleco might be unable to fulfill critical business functions and serve its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions, results of operations, or cash flows of the Registrants. 

20 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, Cleco collects and retains sensitive information including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage, and other confidential information. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data could subject Cleco to both penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws and claims from third parties, or harm Cleco s reputation. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. 
 
 Pandemics, Epidemics, and Other Outbreaks 
 
 Cleco faces risks related to pandemics, epidemics, and outbreaks, including economic, regulatory, legal, workforce, and cybersecurity risks, that could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or liquidity of the Registrants. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic (and other pandemics, epidemics, and outbreaks) has adversely affected global economic activities and conditions. There is considerable uncertainty associated with pandemics, epidemics, and outbreaks regarding the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of any of these occurrences, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns that could reduce the availability and productivity of Cleco employees, key contractors, and vendors. Cleco s ability to timely satisfy regulatory requirements, such as recordkeeping and/or timely reporting requirements, could be affected. 
 On December 4, 2020, Cleco Power made a filing with the LPSC requesting recovery of the expenses incurred as a result of an LPSC executive order issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, prohibiting the disconnection of utilities for nonpayment, as well as the lost revenue associated with the disconnection fees and incremental costs. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of 3.0 million for expenses incurred related to the executive order. Approval of the recovery of these expenses by the LPSC is expected in the second quarter of 2023. For more information regarding the regulatory asset associated with the LPSC s executive order, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities COVID-19 Executive Order. 
 Cleco cannot predict the duration, extent, effect, or ultimate impact of any pandemic, epidemic, outbreak, or governmental responsive measure may have on the global, national, or local economy, the capital markets, or Cleco s suppliers or customers. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, or liquidity of the Registrants. 

Transmission Constraints 
 
 Transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Energy prices in the MISO market are based on LMP, which includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have a higher LMP. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun s pricing zones or result in transmission curtailments. Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun are awarded and/or purchase FTRs in auctions facilitated by MISO. However, insufficient FTR allocations or increased FTR costs, due to negative congestion flows, may result in an unexpected increase in energy costs to Cleco s customers. For Cleco Power, if a disallowance of additional fuel costs associated with congestion is ordered by the LPSC resulting in a refund to Cleco Power s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Cleco s Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Facilities 
 
 Cleco s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages, significant maintenance requirements, and interruption of fuel deliveries. 
 The operation of power generation facilities involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel supply interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Aging equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency, or to comply with environmental permits. Newer equipment can also be subject to unexpected failures. Accordingly, Cleco may incur more frequent unplanned outages, higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures, higher replacement costs of purchased power, increased fuel costs, MISO related costs, and the loss of potential revenue related to competitive opportunities. The costs of such repairs, maintenance, and purchased power may not be fully recoverable in rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco s generating facilities are currently fueled primarily by coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke. The deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand, decreased regional supply, production shortages, weather-related disturbances, railroad constraints or disruptions, waterway levels, labor strikes, or lack of transportation capacity. If suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel and associated inventories are depleted, Cleco may be unable to operate its generating units which may cause Cleco Power to incur higher costs, which in turn could increase the cost to customers. Cleco Power s fuel and MISO-procured/settled energy expenses, which are recovered from its customers through the FAC, are subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the LPSC. 
 Cleco Power could be indirectly liable for the impacts of other companies activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by Cleco Power. The liability for impacts on reclaimed lands may not be recoverable in rates and could 

21 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 The construction of and capital improvements to power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful or significantly more expensive than planned, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the Registrants could be materially affected. 
 Cleco s ability to complete construction of or capital improvements to power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include engineering and project execution risk and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as set forth under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, inaccurate cost estimates, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel or material costs, changes in the economy, changes in laws or regulations, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of Cleco may materially affect the schedule and cost of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Cleco could incur additional costs including termination payments, face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project, or be unable to recover such costs in rates. Furthermore, failure to maintain various levels of generating unit availability or transmission and distribution reliability may result in various disallowances of Cleco Power s investments. 
 
 Alternative Generation Technology 
 
 Changes in technology may have a material adverse effect on the value of Cleco Power s and Cleco Cajun s generating facilities. 
 A basic premise of Cleco s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity, most notably wind turbines, photovoltaic cells, and other solar generated power. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies. As new technologies are developed and become available, the quantity and pattern of electricity purchased by customers could decline, with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generating assets. In addition, to the extent Cleco is slow to adopt viable alternative generation technologies, employs technology that is problematic to operate, and/or under or over relies on these alternative technologies, the value of Cleco Power s and Cleco Cajun s generating facilities could be reduced. 
 
 Litigation 
 
 Cleco is subject to litigation related to the 2016 Merger. 
 In connection with the 2016 Merger, four actions were filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Louisiana and three actions were filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and 

Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation 2016 Merger for a discussion of these actions. 
 It is possible that additional claims beyond those that have already been filed will be brought by the current plaintiffs or by others in an effort to seek monetary relief from Cleco s former directors and officers. Cleco is not able to predict the outcome of these actions, or others, nor can Cleco predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the actions. In addition, the cost to Cleco of defending the actions, even if resolved in the defendants favor, could be substantial. Such actions could also divert the attention of Cleco s management and resources from day-to-day operations. 
 The Registrants are parties to various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary operations of their business. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Registrants may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and, as a result, these matters may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Cleco Cajun 
 
 The success of Cleco Cajun depends, in part, on Cleco s ability to manage the acquired business and realize anticipated benefits. 
 On February 4, 2019, Cleco acquired all of the membership interests of South Central Generating upon the closing of the Cleco Cajun Transaction. The success of Cleco Cajun will depend, in part, on Cleco s ability to manage and operate the unregulated business through service to electric cooperative customers and other wholesale customers. The majority of Cleco Cajun s capacity is contracted through the first quarter of 2025. 
 Cleco Cajun s cooperative customers have finalized their recontracting decisions beyond the first quarter of 2025 and all have notified Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider. The regulatory certification process for the new supply contracts has been finalized by the LPSC for all but three cooperative customers. This non-selection is believed to be the result of a trend toward cooperatives favoring shorter-term, market-based solutions and intermittent renewables rather than asset-backed, long-term full-service contracts. Cleco is exploring options related to its investment in Cleco Cajun, including the potential sale of part or all of Cleco Cajun s assets. Cleco Cajun s failure to recontract these agreements, the failure to enter into new contracts with other counterparties, or failure to take other mitigating measures for the loss of existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on Cleco s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity as early as the second quarter of 2025.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 REGULATORY RISKS 
 
 Regulatory Compliance 
 
 Cleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants business or result in significant additional costs. 
 Cleco s business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local energy, environmental, and other laws and regulations. Should Cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on Cleco, Cleco s business could be adversely affected. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to Cleco or Cleco s facilities in a manner that may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants business or result in significant additional costs. 
 As a result of the 2016 Merger, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power made the 2016 Merger Commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, the extension of Cleco Power s FRP for an additional two years, maintaining employee headcount, salaries, and benefits for ten years, and a limitation from incurring additional long-term debt, excluding non-recourse debt, unless certain financial ratios are achieved. Additionally, upon approval of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, holding Cleco Power retail customers harmless for any adverse impacts, increased costs of debt or equity, and credit rating downgrades attributable to the Cleco Cajun Transaction and the repayment of 400.0 million of Cleco Holdings debt by 2024. For information about Cleco Holdings repayment schedule, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 9 Debt Cleco. 
 
 Cleco Power s Rates 
 
 The LPSC and FERC regulate the retail rates and wholesale transmission tariffs, respectively, that Cleco Power can charge its customers. 
 Cleco Power s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its LPSC-jurisdictional customers through LPSC-approved rates and its ability to recover its FERC-authorized revenue requirements from its FERC-jurisdictional wholesale transmission customers. Cleco Power s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital, including long-term debt and equity. Generally, historical costs are used by the LPSC in determining Cleco Power s rates. If Cleco Power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital, the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants could be materially adversely affected. Recovery of these costs could result in rising utility bills threatening the affordability of such costs by Cleco Power s customers in certain demographic areas, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco Power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases or, in some cases, a request for extension of an FRP. During those 

cases, the LPSC determines Cleco Power s rate base, depreciation rates, operation and maintenance costs, and administrative and general costs that Cleco Power may recover from its retail customers through its rates. These proceedings may examine, among other things, the prudency of Cleco Power s operation and maintenance practices, level of subject expenditures, allowed rates of return, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The LPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs found not to have been prudently incurred. Rate cases generally have timelines of approximately one year, and decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty. The transmission tariffs of Cleco Power are regulated by FERC with its own regulatory proceedings. Both the LPSC and FERC regulatory proceedings can involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, all of whom have differing concerns but who have the common objective of just and reasonable rates. 
 Transmission rates that MISO transmission owners may collect are regulated by FERC. In November 2019, FERC voted to adopt new methodology for evaluating base ROE for public utilities under the Federal Power Act. Cleco Power is unable to determine when a binding FERC order will be issued. Any reduction to the ROE component of the transmission rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Retail Electric Service 
 
 Cleco Power s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the LPSC and reviews may result in refunds to customers. 
 Cleco Power s retail rates for residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the LPSC. Cleco Power s current retail rate plan became effective on July 1, 2021. If a refund of previously recorded revenue is required as a result of the LPSC s review, the refund could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For more information about the current retail rate plan, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 13 Regulation and Rates Regulatory Refunds FRP. 
 Cleco Power s next base rate case is required to be filed with the LPSC on or before March 31, 2023. The outcome of any future base rate case could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 LPSC Audits 
 
 The LPSC conducts fuel audits that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue. 
 Generally, Cleco Power s cost of fuel used for electric generation and cost of purchased power are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC, which are performed at least every other year. For more information about Cleco Power s current fuel audit, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, 

23 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Fuel Audits. 
 Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance by the LPSC, if any, related to FAC filings. If a disallowance of fuel costs is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 The LPSC conducts audits of environmental costs that could result in Cleco Power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue. 
 Cleco Power has an EAC that is used to recover from customers certain costs of environmental compliance. The costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. These costs are subject to periodic review by the LPSC. 
 Cleco Power has EAC filings for January 2020 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. If a disallowance of environmental costs is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 FERC Audit 
 
 FERC conducts audits that could result in Cleco Power making refunds of previously recorded revenue. 
 Generally, Cleco Power records wholesale transmission revenue through approved formula rates, Attachment O of the MISO tariff, and certain grandfathered agreements. The calculation of the rate formulas, as well as FERC accounting and reporting requirements, are subject to periodic audits by FERC. Management is unable to predict the timing of future audits and whether or not the outcome of such future audits will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 MISO 
 
 MISO market operations could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, generation revenues, energy supply costs, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco is a member of the MISO market region referred to as MISO South, which encompasses parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Dispatch of generation resources and generation volumes to the market is determined by MISO. Costs in the MISO South region are heavily influenced by commodity fuel prices, transmission congestion, dispatch of the generating assets owned not only by Cleco, but by all market participants in the MISO South region, and the overall demand and generation availability in the region. 
 MISO evaluates forced outage rates to assess generating unit capacity for Cleco s planning reserve margin. If Cleco is subject to a significant amount of forced outages, Cleco may 

not possess sufficient planning reserves to serve its needs and could be forced to purchase capacity from the MISO resource adequacy auction. For Cleco Power, the costs of such capacity may not be recoverable in its rates and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Using MISO s unforced capacity method for determining generating unit capacity, Cleco Power s fleet provided for 9 MW of capacity in excess of its peak, coincident to MISO s peak, in 2022. Due to generation resource retirements, increased reliance on intermittent resources, significant weather events with correlated generator outages, and declining excess reserve margins that will profoundly impact future grid reliability, MISO is currently transitioning from a traditional annual unforced capacity value to a seasonal accreditation capacity value. Because of the recentness of the transition, management is unable to predict the potential impact the transition will have on Cleco s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Reliability and CIP Standards Compliance 
 
 Cleco is subject to mandatory reliability and CIP standards. Fines and civil penalties are imposed on those who fail to comply with these standards. 
 NERC serves as the ERO with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability and CIP standards, subject to FERC approval, for users of the nation s transmission system. FERC enforces compliance with these standards. New standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified. 
 As these standards continue to be adopted and modified, they may impose additional compliance requirements on Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun separately, which may result in increased capital expenditures and operating expenses. Failure to comply with these standards can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties. 
 A NERC Reliability Standards audit and NERC CIP Audit are conducted every three years for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. For more information on Cleco s current and future audits, see Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Market Structure Wholesale Electric Markets ERO. 
 Management is unable to predict the financial outcome of any future audits or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Environmental Compliance 
 
 Cleco s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant. The costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations, as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities, could be significant to the Registrants. 
 Cleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal, state, and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, and health and safety. Cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities. Existing environmental laws, regulations, and permits could be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws 

24 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to Cleco. As a result, some of Cleco s EGUs could be rendered uneconomical to maintain or operate and could prompt early retirement of certain generation units. Any legal obligation that would require Cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as fuel for new and existing EGUs. Cleco will evaluate potential solutions to comply with such regulations and monitor rulemaking and any legal matters impacting the proposed regulations. Cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with such revisions, reinterpretations, and new requirements. If Cleco were to fail to comply, it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce production from its facilities. Cleco cannot predict the timing or the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals. 
 Cleco Power may request from its customers recovery of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and regulations. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs, there could be a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Wholesale Electric Service 
 
 Cleco s business practices are regulated by FERC, and the wholesale rates of both Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun are subject to FERC s triennial market power analysis. Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates. 
 FERC requires a utility to pass a screening test as a condition for securing and/or retaining approval to sell electricity in wholesale markets at market-based rates. An updated market power analysis must be filed with FERC every three years or upon the occurrence of a change in status as defined by FERC regulation. Cleco filed its most recent triennial market power analysis in December 2020, and it is currently pending FERC approval. The next triennial market power analysis is expected to be filed in December 2023. In the future, if FERC determines Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds, Cleco Power and/or Cleco Cajun could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market-based rates, which could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISKS 
 
 Commodity and Commercial Transactions 
 
 Cleco may enter into fuel supply contracts, energy hedge transactions, and/or commercial transactions, including sales to wholesale customers. If risks related to these transactions are not managed effectively, they may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Registrants. 
 During its normal course of business, Cleco is exposed to uncertain market prices of electricity, natural gas, coal, and other commodities. Market price volatility can impact costs of fuel supply for generation, generation revenue, cost to serve Cleco s contracted wholesale electricity customers, customer 

utility bills, and revenue from customers. To manage market price volatility, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun may each enter into purchases or sales of certain physical and financial commodity contracts within established risk management guidelines. 
 For Cleco Power, the changes in fair value of transactions accounted for as derivatives under authoritative accounting guidance are deferred as a component of deferred fuel assets or liabilities in accordance with regulatory policy. At settlement, realized gains or losses are included in Cleco Power s FAC and reflected on customer s bills as a component of the fuel charge. Recovery of these costs included in Cleco Power s FAC is subject to, and may be disallowed as part of, a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the LPSC. For Cleco Cajun, the changes in fair value of transactions accounted for as derivatives under authoritative accounting guidance as well as the realized gains and losses at settlement are recorded on the income statement as either a component of fuel expense, for gas-related derivatives, or purchased power expense, for FTRs. 
 Because Cleco is subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices, Cleco is unable to accurately predict the effect that these transactions could have on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. All risks associated with these transactions cannot be fully eliminated. Therefore, the judgements and assumptions made in the underlying decisions related to these transactions could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Counterparty Risk and Guarantees 
 
 Cleco may be required to provide credit support to its counterparties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants liquidity. 
 Cleco may guarantee the performance of all or some of its commercial transaction obligations and may also be required to provide counterparty credit support in the form of cash or cash equivalent collateral to secure all or part of those obligations. Downgrades in Cleco s credit quality or changes in the market prices of transaction-related energy commodities could increase the collateral or margin required to be on deposit with the counterparty or clearing house. The required credit support or increase in credit support could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants liquidity. 
 
 Cleco is exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their performance obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial performance of the Registrants. 
 Counterparties may fail to perform on their physical or financial obligations. Currently, Cleco has industry accepted master agreements in place with counterparties that provide credit default language. Some master agreements with counterparties contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Cleco. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Cleco may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided; however, in the event of a default, credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Cleco may incur losses in excess of amounts already paid, if any, to the counterparties or due to an adverse replacement cost of the transaction and may be unable to collect liquated damages. 

25 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 The credit commitments of Cleco s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. In no case would Cleco Power bear any commodity or credit risk of Cleco Cajun. 
 
 Global Economic Environment and Uncertainty 
 
 Adverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Registrants liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plan s assets or sustained increases in plan liabilities could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect the Registrants liquidity and results of operations. 
 Performance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under Cleco s defined benefit pension plan. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by Cleco and could increase Cleco s funding requirements related to the pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the present value of Cleco s liabilities under the pension plan. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions. 
 
 Cleco Credit Ratings 
 
 A downgrade in Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s credit ratings could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs, a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources, and a restriction on Cleco Power making distributions to Cleco Holdings. 
 Neither Cleco Holdings nor Cleco Power can assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. If S P, Moody s, or Fitch were to downgrade Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s long-term ratings, particularly below investment grade, the value of their debt securities could be adversely affected. Downgrades of either Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s credit ratings could result in additional fees and higher interest rates for borrowings under their respective credit facilities and term loans. In addition, Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power, as the case may be, would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings, may be subject to more onerous debt covenants, and their pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, the 2016 Merger Commitments provide for limitations on the amount of distributions that may be paid from Cleco Power to Cleco Holdings, depending on Cleco Power s common equity ratio and its corporate credit/issuer ratings. As a result, Cleco Power may be prohibited from making distributions to Cleco Holdings in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade. 
 
 Cleco Power LLC s Unsecured and Unsubordinated Obligations 
 
 Cleco Power LLC s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including, without limitation, its senior notes, will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of Cleco Power LLC and structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities and preferred equity of any of Cleco Power LLC s subsidiaries. 
 Cleco Power LLC s senior notes and its obligations under various loan agreements and refunding agreements with the Rapides Finance Authority, the Louisiana Public Facilities 

Authority, and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds for the benefit of Cleco Power LLC are unsecured and rank equally with all of Cleco Power LLC s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, Cleco Power LLC had an aggregate of 1.46 billion of unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness net of debt discount and debt expense. The unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Cleco Power LLC will be effectively subordinated to, and thus have a junior position to, any secured debt that Cleco Power LLC may have outstanding from time to time (including any mortgage bonds) with respect to the assets securing such debt. Certain agreements entered into by Cleco Power LLC with other lenders that are unsecured provide that if Cleco Power LLC issues secured debt, Cleco Power LLC is obligated to grant these lenders the same security interest in certain assets of Cleco Power LLC. If such a security interest were to arise, it would further subordinate Cleco Power LLC s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Cleco Power LLC had no secured indebtedness outstanding. Cleco Power LLC may issue mortgage bonds in the future under any future Indenture of Mortgage, and holders of mortgage bonds would have a prior claim on certain Cleco Power LLC material assets upon dissolution, winding up, liquidation, or reorganization. Additionally, neither Cleco Power LLC nor its creditors, including holders of its senior notes, can use the assets of Cleco Securitization I to settle debts of Cleco Power LLC. 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 Presidential Administration 
 
 The Presidential administration has made and may continue to make substantial changes to environmental, fiscal, and tax policies that could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants business. 
 The Presidential administration may propose substantial changes to environmental, fiscal, and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform, more stringent and onerous requirements for reducing GHG emissions and other pollutants from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, and other objectives that may impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Since taking office in January 2021, the current President has issued several executive orders designed to address climate change and GHG emissions, as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review past environmental actions. Furthermore, the current President has recommitted the U.S. to the Paris Agreement and announced the U.S. s nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement at the summit on climate change on April 22, 2021. The target aims to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-52 compared to a 2005 baseline by 2030. The current Presidential administration has also issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the administration has reviewed and approved the rule. The executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, and it is possible that these changes could adversely affect Cleco s business. Until any such changes are enacted, management is unable to determine the impact of any such changes on the Registrants business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 

26 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Taxes 
 
 Changes in taxation due to uncertain effects of various tax reform legislation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 The Registrants make judgments regarding the utilization of existing income tax credits and the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. Tax obligations include income, franchise, property, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results, or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by the Registrants could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 The IRA of 2022 was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Management is still monitoring any potential impact the recently enacted IRA could have on the Registrants. For more information related to the IRA s tax and renewable provisions, see Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Significant Events Tax Reform. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 Cleco s insurance coverage may not be sufficient and may become more costly to maintain. 
 Cleco currently has property, casualty, cybersecurity, and liability insurance policies in place to protect its employees, board of managers, and assets in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Cleco s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Like other utilities that serve coastal regions, Cleco Power does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because it believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Cleco Power may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm recovery bonds or a change in Cleco Power s regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Cleco Power may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 Global Economic Uncertainty and Access to Capital 
 
 Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the Registrants cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital to operate and grow the business. 
 The Registrants business is capital intensive and dependent upon the Registrants respective abilities to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. The Registrants liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane 

or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster or when there are spikes in the price of natural gas and other commodities. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel, purchased power, or storm restoration costs; higher than expected required pension contributions; an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines; less cash flow from operations than expected; or other unexpected events, could cause the financing needs of the Registrants to increase materially. 
 Events beyond the Registrants control, such as political uncertainty in the U.S. (including the ongoing debates related to the U.S. federal government budget), volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets, and rising interest rates as a result of increases in the targeted federal funds rate range by the Federal Reserve may create uncertainty that could increase their cost of capital or impair their ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on their respective bank credit facilities. Additionally, upon approval of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, Cleco made commitments to the LPSC including, but not limited to, holding Cleco Power retail customers harmless for any adverse impacts, increased costs of debt or equity, and credit rating downgrades attributable to the Cleco Cajun Transaction; and the repayment of 400.0 million of Cleco Holdings debt by 2024. At December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of Cleco Holdings debt to be repaid by 2024 was 132.3 million. The Registrants may be unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their respective credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If the Registrants are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants ability to fund capital expenditures or to service debt, or on the Registrants flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. 
 
 Inflation may negatively impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco has observed that prices for equipment, materials, supplies, employee labor, and contractor services have increased. Long-term inflationary pressures may result in such prices continuing to increase more quickly than expected. Increases in inflation raises costs for labor, materials, and services, and Cleco may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset such costs with increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 
 ESG 
 
 Increased focus on and changing expectations regarding ESG programs may result in constraints on the Registrants access to capital and increased costs and expenses. 
 Stakeholder scrutiny of companies ESG practices has been increasing across numerous industries. In recent years, certain stakeholders, including an increasing number of investors and lenders, have started placing more importance on ESG criteria when making lending and investment decisions. Although the Registrants are not currently aware of any instances where 

27 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 access to capital was limited due to these developments, the increased focus on and activism related to ESG may limit their access to capital or financing and/or increase the cost of capital or financing as some investors or lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the Registrants or reallocate or not commit capital based on their assessment of the Registrants ESG profile. Additionally, failure 

to address and meet stakeholders ESG expectations, which continue to evolve, or failure to report progress on ESG initiatives may negatively impact the Registrants reputation and business or could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

 OVERVIEW 
 Cleco is a regional energy company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its two principal operating business segments: 
 
 Cleco Power, a regulated electric utility company that owns nine generating units with a total rated capacity of 3,035 MW and serves approximately 293,000 customers in Louisiana through its retail business and supplies wholesale power in Louisiana and Mississippi; and 
 Cleco Cajun, an unregulated electric utility company that owns 14 generating units with a total rated capacity of 3,379 

MW and wholesale contracts serving a mixture of electric cooperatives, a municipal body, a utility, and a non-profit corporation. 
 
 Significant Events 
 
 Securitization 
 
 Storm Securitization 
 During 2020 and 2021, Cleco Power s distribution and transmission systems sustained damage from four separate hurricanes, Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta, and Ida, and two severe winter storms, Winter Storms Uri and Viola. The damage to equipment from the storms required replacement, as well as repair of existing assets. 
 On March 30, 2022, the LPSC approved an uncontested stipulated settlement agreement filed by the LPSC Staff and Cleco Power relating to securitization of these storm costs. On April 1, 2022, the LPSC issued the financing order authorizing Cleco Power to issue storm recovery bonds in the aggregate principal amount of up to 425.0 million. On June 22, 2022, Cleco Power completed a securitized financing of the deferred storm costs through Cleco Securitization I. For more information on the securitization, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementa ry Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 19 Securitization.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Dolet Hills Securitization 
 On October 6, 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO made a joint filing with the LPSC seeking authorization to close the Oxbow mine. At December 31, 2021, the Dolet Hills Power Station was retired, and all of Cleco Power s proportionate share of lignite-related costs had been billed by DHLC and Oxbow. On January 31, 2022, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC requesting recovery of stranded and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station as well as deferred fuel and other costs associated with the closure of the Oxbow mine. These costs are currently under a prudency review by the LPSC. Pending the outcome of the prudency review, Cleco Power intends to seek a financing order to securitize the unrecovered Dolet Hills Power Station closure costs and Oxbow mine closure costs. The prudency review is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2023. For more information on the prudency review of the deferred fuel and other mine-related closure costs, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementa ry Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews Deferred Lignite and Mine Closure Costs and Risks and Uncertainties. 
 
 COVID-19 
 In March 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic, and the U.S. declared a national emergency. In response to these declarations and the rapid spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments imposed varying degrees of restrictions on business and social activities to contain COVID-19. These restrictions significantly impacted many sectors of the economy with record levels of unemployment driven by businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities modifying, curtailing, or ceasing normal operations. 
 On December 4, 2020, Cleco Power made a filing with the LPSC requesting the recovery of expenses incurred as a result of an LPSC executive order, issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, prohibiting the disconnection of utilities for non-payment, as well as the lost revenue associated with the disconnection fees and incremental costs. Cleco Power anticipates approval of the recovery of these expenses in the second quarter of 2023. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of 3.0 million for expenses incurred. For more information on the regulatory treatment of the regulatory asset, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities COVID-19 Executive Order. 
 Cleco has implemented certain measures that it believes will provide financial flexibility and help maintain its liquidity. Cleco is working with its suppliers to mitigate the pandemic stimulated impacts to its supply chain. Cleco will continue to monitor developments affecting its workforce, customers, and suppliers and take additional precautions as warranted. Cleco continues to assess the COVID-19 situation and cannot predict the full impact that COVID-19, or any significant related disruptions, will have on its business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operation s. For additional discussion regarding certain risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Pandemics, Epidemics, and Other Outbreaks. 

Tax Reform 
 On August 16, 2022, the IRA of 2022 became law. The IRA of 2022 seeks to lower gasoline and electricity prices, increase energy security, and help consumers afford emissions-cutting technologies. In addition, the IRA of 2022 provides tax credits for clean electricity sources and energy storage, as well as creates programs to enable states and electric utilities to transition to clean power. There are several tax and renewables provisions in this legislation that could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. These include provisions related to direct pay and credit transferability, enhanced carbon capture and sequestration credits, new technology-neutral clean energy investment credits, and new technology-neutral clean energy production credits. These credits are expected to help fund Cleco Power s Project Diamond Vault as well as future renewable and electrification projects. Management continues to monitor any potential impact the IRA of 2022 could have on the Registrants. 
 
 ESG Goals 
 Cleco is accelerating efforts to protect the environment, manage social relationships, govern responsibly, and ensure accountability. To protect the environment, Cleco is increasing its renewable and electrification initiatives and is aiming to reduce GHG emissions in ways such as incorporating renewable energy resources into its generating fleet, as it replaces coal-fired generation units retired after serving their useful lives. Cleco aims to sustainably reduce its GHG emissions 60.0 by 2030 with aspirations of net zero emissions by 2050. To manage social relationships, Cleco plans to ensure that the electricity that it generates is affordable, reliable, and sustainable. Cleco also plans to continue to support community investment opportunities across its service territory and create a workforce culture that rewards inclusion, safety, and innovation. To govern responsibly, Cleco plans to continue operating according to policies and practices that support the governance framework. To ensure accountability, Cleco created an ESG Steering Committee and appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer to oversee the continued implementation of the ESG goals. Currently, management is unable to predict the impact of implementing these ESG goals on the Registrants. For more information on these ESG goals, see Part I, Item 1, Business Human Capital Diversity and Inclusion, Communities, and Oversight and Governance. 
 
 Cleco Power 
 Many factors affect Cleco Power s primary business of generating, delivering, and selling electricity. These factors include weather and the presence of a stable regulatory environment, which impact the ROE, as well as the recovery of costs related to storms, growing energy demand, and rising fuel prices; the ability to increase energy sales while containing costs; the ability to reliably deliver power to its jurisdictional customers; the ability to comply with increasingly stringent regulatory and environmental standards; and the ability to successfully perform in MISO while subject to related operating challenges and uncertainties, including increased wholesale competition. In addition to the ESG goals previously discussed, Cleco Power s current key initiatives include beginning Project Diamond Vault, continuing the DSMART project, and maintaining and growing its retail business. Cleco

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Power is also pursuing various renewable and electrification initiatives. These and other initiatives are discussed below. 
 Effective July 1, 2021, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 9.5 , while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.0 . Additionally, 60.0 of retail earnings between 10.0 and 10.5 , and all retail earnings over 10.5 , are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC, annually.

 Renewable and Electrification Initiatives 
 
 Project Diamond Vault 
 On April 11, 2022, Cleco Power announced Project Diamond Vault, a carbon capture and sequestration facility that is anticipated to be constructed at the Brame Energy Center. This facility is expected to capture and compress carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fuel at Madison Unit 3 and store the compressed gas permanently in deep geological formations located beneath the Brame Energy Center. Cleco Power expects to reduce the carbon output of Madison Unit 3 by approximately 95 with the implementation of this technology. Through this project, Cleco Power plans to leverage technology advancements and Louisiana s natural resources to create a clean power solution. 
 The Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study for Project Diamond Vault has begun and is projected to cost approximately 12.0 million. A 9.0 million congressional appropriation has been secured, subject to the U.S. Department of Energy s grant process, to help offset costs of this study. The FEED study is expected to be completed in mid-2024 and major permitting is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025. Construction of the project is expected to begin by the end of 2025. Management expects the total project will be completed by the end of 2028. After the cost of the FEED study, the remaining project cost is currently estimated to be between 1.10 billion and 1.40 billion. This estimate will be refined throughout the FEED study process as additional information and cost estimates become available. Cleco anticipates funding this project through one or more sources including tax credits provided by the IRA of 2022, Department of Energy grants, private equity investment, and partnership interests. 
 
 Other 
 On July 22, 2022, Cleco Power entered into a long-term agreement to purchase, among other things, the output, capacity, and current and future environmental resource credits of a 240-MW solar electric generation facility to be constructed in DeSoto Parish and owned by a third party. The agreement is subject to LPSC approval and other conditions precedent. If approved, Cleco Power expects to begin receiving output from this facility in 2025. 
 Cleco Power is also pursuing electrification initiatives such as gas compression, e-trucking, green tariffs, residential heating programs, and increasing the supply of light duty electric vehicles and forklifts, among others. 
 Cleco Power is seeking available funds from the U.S. government for funding of these electrification initiatives. Cleco 

Power cannot predict the likelihood that any funding from the U.S. government ultimately will be approved. 
 
 DSMART Project 
 The DSMART project includes modernization of Cleco Power s distribution system by replacing or upgrading distribution line equipment to utilize new and emerging technologies to facilitate automatic fault isolation, service restoration, and fault location. The project is expected to provide savings through a reduction in outage restoration time and improve operational efficiencies and time to locate faults. The project is also expected to improve safety and reliability of Cleco Power s distribution assets by minimizing outage patrols and improving situational awareness in the distribution operations center. The total estimated project cost is 90.2 million. The project implementation will be completed in phases, and management expects the total project will be completed by the end of 2027. Cleco Power is currently in the second phase of the project. As of December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had spent 43.1 million on the project. 
 
 Other 
 Cleco Power is working to secure load growth opportunities that include renewing existing franchises, pursuing new franchises, and adding new retail load opportunities with large industrial, commercial, and residential load. The retail opportunities include sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, chemicals, metals, national accounts, government and military, wood and paper, health care, information technology, transportation, and other manufacturing. 
 In 2021 through a request for proposal process, a significant wholesale customer currently under contract with Cleco Power informed Cleco Power that it was not selected as a provider of capacity and energy after the first quarter of 2024, and on October 19, 2022, the LPSC certified these results. Cleco Power s failure to recontract this agreement is expected to affect jurisdictional retail rates that will be subject to review by the LPSC in conjunction with Cleco Power s next rate case, which is expected to be effective on July 1, 2024. 
 
 Cleco Cajun 
 Cleco Cajun currently has power purchase agreements totaling approximately 2,069 MW with 12 wholesale customers, which consist of a mixture of electric cooperatives, a municipal body, a utility, and a non-profit corporation. These contracts provide Cleco Cajun with predictable cash flow and market risk mitigation through at least the first quarter of 2025 but may prevent Cleco Cajun from taking advantage of rising market rates for power. 
 Competition for Cleco Cajun s electric cooperative customers is limited through the first quarter of 2025, when the majority of the wholesale electric supply contracts expire. All of Cleco Cajun s cooperative customers have notified Cleco Cajun that it was not selected as a provider beyond the first quarter of 2025. The regulatory certification process for the new supply contracts has been finalized by the LPSC for all but three cooperative customers. This non-selection is believed to be the result of a trend toward cooperatives favoring shorter-term, market-based solutions and intermittent renewables rather than asset-backed, long-term full-service contracts. 
 Cleco is exploring options related to its investment in Cleco Cajun, including the potential sale of part or all of Cleco Cajun s assets. Cleco Cajun s failure to recontract its current

 cooperative agreements, failure to enter into new contracts with other counterparties, or failure to take other mitigating measures for the loss of existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on Cleco s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity as early as the second quarter of 2025. 
 Many factors affect Cleco Cajun s primary business of providing wholesale power and capacity. These factors include weather, the market price of power, the sales volume of power through existing contracts, the ability to recontract existing contracts at or before their expiration or enter into new wholesale power agreements with new customers, the ability to comply with increasingly stringent environmental standards, availability of fuel for generation, and compliance with the commitments made to the LPSC as a result of the Cleco Cajun Transaction.

 Significant Factors Affecting Cleco Power 
 
 Revenue is primarily affected by the following factors: 
 As an electric utility, Cleco Power is affected, to varying degrees, by a number of factors influencing the electric utility industry. These factors include, among others, an increasingly competitive business environment; the ability to recover costs through rate-setting proceedings; the ability to successfully perform in MISO and the related operating challenges; the cost of compliance with environmental and reliability regulations; conditions in the credit markets and global economy; changes in the federal and state regulation of generation, transmission, and the sale of electricity; and the increasing uncertainty of future federal and state regulatory and environmental policies. For a discussion of various regulatory changes and competitive forces affecting Cleco Power and other electric utilities, see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Part I, Item 1, Business Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises, and Financial Condition Regulatory and Other Matters Market Structure. For a discussion of risk factors affecting Cleco Power s business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 Cleco Power s residential customers demand for electricity is affected largely by weather. Weather is generally measured in cooling degree-days and heating degree-days. A high number of cooling degree-days may indicate consumers will use more air conditioning, while a high number of heating degree-days may indicate consumers will use more heating. An increase in heating degree-days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree-days because alternative heating sources are more readily available and winter energy is typically priced below the rate charged for energy used in the summer. Normal heating degree-days and cooling degree-days are calculated for a month by separately calculating the average actual heating and cooling degree-days for that month over a period of 30 years. 
 Over the last five years, Cleco Power s non-industrial retail sales have been relatively steady. Cleco Power anticipates moderate growth in retail sales over the next five years. Cleco Power expects to begin providing service to expansions of current customers operations, as well as service to new retail customers. Cleco Power s expectations and projections regarding retail sales are dependent upon factors such as weather conditions, natural gas prices, customer conservation efforts, retail marketing and business development programs, and the economy of Cleco Power s service area. Cleco Power is pursuing load growth opportunities that include renewal of existing franchises as well as adding new franchises. For more information on other expectations of future energy sales on Cleco Power, see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Future Electricity Sales.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Other issues facing the electric utility industry that could affect sales include: 
 
 imposition of federal and/or state renewable portfolio standards, 
 imposition of energy efficiency mandates, 
 legislative and regulatory changes, 
 increases in environmental regulations and compliance costs, 
 cost of power impacted by the price movement of fuels and the addition of new generation capacity, 
 transmission congestion costs, 
 increases in capital and operations and maintenance costs due to higher construction and labor costs, 
 changes in electric rates compared to customers ability to pay, 
 changes in the credit markets and local and global economies, and 
 the LPSC s consideration of adopting minimum physical capacity threshold requirements for load serving entities. 
 
 For more information on energy legislation in regulatory matters that could affect Cleco, see Part I, Item 1, Business Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises Legislative and Regulatory Changes and Matters. 
 Cleco Power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases, or in some cases, a request for extension of an FRP. During those cases, the LPSC determines Cleco Power s rate base, depreciation rates, operation and maintenance costs, and administrative and general costs that Cleco Power may recover from its retail customers through its rates. Generally, historical costs are used by the LPSC in determining Cleco Power s rates. These proceedings may examine, among other things, the prudency of Cleco Power s operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures, allowed rates of return, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The LPSC has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred. Rate cases generally have timelines of approximately one year, and decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty. Effective July 1, 2021, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 9.5 , while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.0 . Additionally, 60.0 of retail earnings between 10.0 and 10.5 , and all retail earnings over 10.5 , are required to be refunded to customers. Cleco Power s next rate case is expected to be effective on July 1, 2024. The transmission tariffs of Cleco Power are regulated by FERC with its own regulatory proceedings. Both the LPSC and FERC regulatory proceedings can involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, all of whom have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates. 
 
 Other expenses are primarily affected by the following factors: 
 The majority of Cleco Power s non-fuel cost recovery expenses consist of other operations, maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and taxes other than income taxes. Other operations expenses are affected by, among other things, the cost of employee benefits, insurance expense, and the costs associated with energy delivery and customer service. Annual maintenance expenses associated with Cleco Power s plants generally depend upon their physical characteristics, 

maintenance practices, and the effectiveness of their preventive maintenance programs. Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses are generally affected by the level of repair and rehabilitation of lines to maintain reliability. Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily affected by the cost of the facilities in service, the time the facilities were placed in service, and the estimated useful life of the facilities. Taxes other than income taxes generally include payroll taxes, franchise taxes, and property taxes.

 Fuel Cost Recovery/Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Changes in fuel costs historically have not significantly affected Cleco Power s net income. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Approximately 78 

of Cleco Power s total fuel cost during 2022 was regulated by the LPSC. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC which may result in a refund to customers. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by customer usage, the per unit cost of fuel used for electric generation, and the dispatch of Cleco Power s generating facilities by MISO. In February 2021, Cleco Power s incremental fuel and purchased power costs were impacted significantly as a result of Winter Storms Uri and Viola. On March 29, 2021, Cleco Power received approval from the LPSC to recover a portion of the incremental fuel and purchased power costs resulting from Winter Storms Uri and Viola through Cleco Power s FAC over a period of 12 months beginning with the May 2021 bills. Cleco Power s incremental fuel and purchased power costs during 2021 were also impacted by higher costs of lignite at the Dolet Hills Power Station, which are being recovered through Cleco Power s FAC. For more information on the accounting for MISO transactions, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for MISO Transactions.

 Electric Customer Credits 
 Electric customer credits decreased 33.2 million primarily due to 39.9 million of lower credits to retail customers for the federal tax-related benefits of the TCJA now being a component of rates as a result of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. After the implementation of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, these credits offset base revenue on Cleco Power s Consolidated Statement of Income. Partially offsetting this decrease was 7.1 million for refunds to Cleco Power s retail customers as a result of the LPSC approved settlement disallowing the recovery of planning and construction costs incurred for the St. Mary Clean Energy Center. For more information on the TCJA, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 13 Regulation and Rates Regulatory Refunds TCJA. For more information about the LPSC settlement and disallowance, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews St. Mary Clean Energy Center. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations revenue increased 24.1 million primarily due to 13.2 million for storm recovery securitization revenue, 11.6 million of higher transmission revenue from increased usage at higher rates, 1.9 million of higher forfeited discounts, and 1.0 million of higher pole attachment rental income. Partially offsetting these increases was 3.8 million of lower revenue as a result of the expiration of a utility contract in September 2021. 

35 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Non-Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Non-recoverable fuel and purchased power increased 18.4 million primarily due to 10.9 million for higher volumes of power purchased from MISO at higher prices, 4.6 million for lower amounts deferred to a regulatory asset associated with the Northlake Transmission Agreement, and 1.8 million of higher amortization to the Northlake Transmission Agreement regulatory asset. For more information on the Northlake Transmission Agreement regulatory asset, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Other. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 
 Other operations and maintenance expense decreased 6.4 million primarily due to 6.9 million of lower generating routine maintenance expenses largely due to the absence of expenses related to the Dolet Hills Power Station as a result of its retirement in December 2021, 6.3 million of lower generating outage maintenance expenses, and 5.7 million of lower distribution maintenance expenses which was largely the result of fewer storms in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by 6.8 million of higher administrative and general employee related expenses and 3.1 million of higher routine distribution operations expense. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 4.7 million primarily due to 4.3 million for the amortization of regulatory assets relating to Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta, 2.8 million for the amortization of the securitized intangible asset that began in November 2022, and 1.3 million for the absence of a 2021 adjustment to the corporate franchise tax regulatory asset. These increases were partially offset by 5.3 million of lower normal recurring additions to fixed assets. For more information on the securitized intangible asset, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 17 Intangible Assets, Intangible Liabilities, and Goodwill Securitized Intangible Cleco Securitization. 
 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 5.5 million primarily due to the amortization of the Madison Unit 3 property tax regulatory asset that began in July 2022. For more information, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Madison Unit 3 Property Taxes. 
 
 Regulatory Disallowance 
 In September 2022, Cleco Power recognized a regulatory disallowance of 13.8 million for the impairment charge resulting from a portion of planning and construction costs incurred for the St. Mary Clean Energy Center that were deemed imprudent and not recoverable by the LPSC. For more information about the LPSC settlement and disallowance, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews St. Mary Clean Energy Center. 

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction decreased 6.2 million primarily due to the absence of a December 2021 adjustment driven by the timing of the election and LPSC approval of the FERC modified formula. 
 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net decreased 12.5 million primarily due to 8.4 million of lower pension non-service costs largely due to lower amortization of net losses, 2.4 million for the absence of a special termination benefit, and 1.0 million of disallowed costs as a result of the settlement of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. 
 
 Interest Charges 
 Interest charges increased 15.1 million primarily due to 10.0 million for interest on storm recovery bonds issued in June 2022 by Cleco Securitization I, 2.0 million for higher rates on variable rate debt, and 1.3 million for higher interest on floating rate senior notes issued in September 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Federal and state income taxes increased 11.9 million primarily due to 11.6 million for the change in pretax income, excluding AFUDC equity, 5.8 million for state tax expenses, 4.6 million for the amortization of excess ADIT, and 3.8 million for adjustments to tax returns as filed. These increases were partially offset by 13.5 million for the flowthrough of tax benefits.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Electric Operations 
 Electric operations increased 97.8 million primarily due to 86.4 million of higher fuel rates, 10.1 million of higher load volumes, 4.2 million of higher MISO pass-through revenue, and 3.4 million of higher capacity revenue due to higher demand peaks in 2022. These increases were partially offset by 6.7 million for the absence of two power supply agreements. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations revenue increased 20.1 million primarily due to 15.9 million of higher transmission revenue as a result of an increase in usage at higher rates and 4.1 million of higher variable lease revenue from the Cottonwood Sale Leaseback. 
 
 Fuel Used for Electric Generation 
 Fuel used for electric generation increased 35.7 million primarily due to 58.2 million of lower mark-to-market gains on gas-related derivative contracts, 52.9 million of higher natural gas consumption as a result of higher generating unit dispatch due to weather, and 25.6 million of higher coal consumption as a result of higher generating unit dispatch due to weather and higher prices per ton. These increases were partially offset by 104.6 million of realized gains on natural gas derivatives. 
 
 Purchased Power 
 Purchased power increased 122.5 million primarily due to 105.8 million of higher volumes of power purchased from MISO at higher LMP prices and 16.4 million of higher transmission costs due to higher usage. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance 
 Other operations and maintenance expense increased 2.5 million primarily due to 3.5 million of higher generating routine maintenance expenses and 1.6 million of higher generation operations expense. These amounts were partially offset by 2.1 million for expenses related to employee benefits. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 17.9 million primarily due to 14.6 million relating to adjustments to ARO assets to comply with the final CCR Rule as well as a reduction to the remaining lives of those assets. Also contributing to the increase was 2.4 million of higher normal recurring additions to fixed assets. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Federal and state income taxes decreased 17.7 million during 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to 12.5 million for the change in pretax income, 2.5 million for the absence of an adjustment for state tax rate changes, 1.8 million for state tax expenses, and 1.4 million for permanent tax deductions.

 Cleco s results of operations are primarily attributable to the activity of its reportable segments, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. For detailed discussions of those impacts, see Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. Additional impacts to Cleco s results of operations include the following activity at Cleco Holdings: 
 
 a decrease in other expense, net of 5.7 million for the change in cash surrender value of certain trust-owned life insurance policies as a result of more favorable market conditions, 
 a decrease in interest charges of 4.3 million due to lower rates on variable rate debt incurred in connection with the 2016 Merger and the Cleco Cajun Transaction, and 
 an increase in income tax expense of 0.4 million primarily for 2.0 million for the change in pretax income, excluding AFUDC equity and 0.6 million for state tax expense, partially offset by 1.4 million for an adjustment for state tax rate changes and 0.8 million for permanent tax deductions.

 Base 
 Base revenue decreased 1.8 million primarily due to 15.6 million of lower rates as a result of the implementation of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. The lower rates are largely due to TCJA bill credits for the retail portion of the unprotected excess ADIT. Prior to the implementation of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, these credits were recorded in Electric customer credits on Cleco Power s Consolidated Statement of Income. Also contributing to the decrease is the absence of 2.4 million of Cleco Katrina/Rita storm restoration surcharge revenue as a result of the final principal and interest payments on the Cleco Katrina/Rita bonds in March 2020. These decreases were partially offset by 9.5 million of interim rate recovery for certain storm costs relating to Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta, 3.6 million of higher revenue due to the absence of impacts from lower usage as a result of Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta in 2020, and 3.2 million of higher usage from colder winter weather.

 Fuel Cost Recovery/Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Changes in fuel costs historically have not significantly affected Cleco Power s net income. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC, which enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Approximately 76 of Cleco Power s total fuel cost during 2021 was regulated by the LPSC. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC which may result in a refund to customers. Generally, fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted 

38 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 by customer usage, the per unit cost of fuel used for electric generation, and the dispatch of Cleco Power s generating facilities by MISO. Cleco Power s incremental fuel and purchased power costs were impacted significantly as a result of Winter Storms Uri and Viola. On March 29, 2021, Cleco Power received approval from the LPSC to recover a portion of these costs through Cleco Power s FAC over a period of 12 months beginning on the May 2021 bills. Cleco Power s incremental fuel and purchased power costs were also impacted by higher costs of lignite at the Dolet Hills Power Station. For more information on the accounting for MISO transactions, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting for MISO Transactions.

For more information on lignite costs at the Dolet Hills Power Station, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Risks and Uncertainties. 
 
 Electric Customer Credits 
 Electric customer credits decreased 12.2 million primarily due to lower credits to retail customers for the federal tax-related benefits of the TCJA as a result of the settlement of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. After the implementation of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, these credits offset base revenue on Cleco Power s Consolidated Statement of Income. For more information on the TCJA, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 13 Regulation and Rates Regulatory Refunds TCJA. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations revenue increased 9.4 million primarily due to 5.1 million of higher transmission revenue, 2.5 million of net higher forfeited discounts primarily as a result of Cleco Power resuming disconnection and late fees in October 2020, following the termination of the LPSC moratorium in July 2020 , and 1.9 million of higher reconnection fees. 
 Non-Recoverable Fuel and Purchased Power 
 Non-recoverable fuel and purchased power increased 7.9 million primarily due to 5.6 million of higher MISO transmission costs and 2.3 million of higher fuel expenses largely due to the winter storms in 2021. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 
 Other operations and maintenance expense increased 2.1 million primarily due to 9.5 million of higher distribution maintenance expenses, 7.3 million of higher generating outage maintenance expenses, 4.9 million of higher customer service expenses relating to increased temporary staffing and increased collection efforts, and 1.6 million of higher reserves for injuries and damages. These increases were partially offset by 8.3 million of lower fees for outside services mostly relating to START project expenses and contract workers, 6.7 million of lower expenses related to employee benefits, and 6.7 million of lower generation operations expenses. 

Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 6.5 million primarily due to 5.3 million of higher normal recurring additions to fixed assets and 3.1 million for the amortization of regulatory assets relating to Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta. These amounts were partially offset by 2.1 million for the absence of amortization of storm damages as a result of the final principal and interest payments on the Cleco Katrina/Rita bonds in 2020. 
 
 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 5.0 million primarily due to 3.2 million of higher property taxes, 0.9 million of higher franchise taxes, and 0.6 million of higher payroll taxes. 
 
 Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 
 Allowance for equity funds used during construction increased 8.9 million primarily due to higher AFUDC rates driven by the timing of the election and LPSC approval of the FERC modified formula authorized in March 2020. 
 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net increased 7.3 million primarily due to 6.3 million of higher pension non-service costs and 1.0 million of disallowed costs as a result of the settlement of Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Federal and state income taxes decreased 36.2 million primarily due to 20.6 million for the amortization of excess ADIT, 10.9 million for adjustments to tax returns as filed, 3.1 million for the flowthrough of tax benefits, and 2.1 for the change in pretax income, excluding AFUDC equity.

 Electric Operations 
 Electric operations increased 32.7 million primarily due to 23.6 million of higher fuel rates, 5.6 million of higher load volumes primarily due to winter storms, 4.4 million of higher MISO make-whole payments, 3.9 million of higher capacity contract rates, and 1.3 million for the absence of a 2020 customer demand adjustment. These increases were partially offset by 4.1 million for the expiration of a power supply agreement in May 2021 and 1.5 million of lower MISO capacity revenue. 
 
 Other Operations Revenue 
 Other operations revenue increased 7.0 million primarily due to 9.7 million of higher transmission revenue, partially offset by 2.7 million of lower lease revenue, including variable lease revenue, as a result of the Cottonwood Sale Leaseback. 
 
 Fuel Used for Electric Generation 
 Fuel used for electric generation decreased 80.4 million primarily due to 68.3 million of higher mark-to-market gains on 

gas-related derivative contracts and 54.7 million of settlements related to gas swaps activity. These decreases were partially offset by 41.7 million of higher coal consumption which was largely the result of higher generating unit dispatch. 
 
 Purchased Power 
 Purchased power increased 69.7 million primarily due to higher costs of purchased power from MISO, largely the result of higher usage and Winter Storms Uri and Viola. 
 
 Other Operations and Maintenance 
 Other operations and maintenance expense increased 2.2 million primarily due to 5.5 million of higher generating outage maintenance expenses, partially offset by 1.6 million of lower generation operations expense and 1.1 million of lower materials and supplies expense. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 8.1 million primarily due to 6.2 million relating to adjustments to ARO assets to comply with the final CCR Rule as well as a reduction to the remaining lives of those assets. Also contributing to the increase was 1.9 million of higher normal recurring additions to fixed assets. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 Federal and state income taxes increased 13.2 million primarily due to 8.3 million for the change in pretax income, 2.5 million for an adjustment for state tax rate changes, 1.8 million for state tax expenses, and 0.5 million for permanent tax deductions. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, was 27.2 which was different than the federal statutory rate. 

Non-GAAP Measure 
 The financial results in the following tables are presented on an accrual basis. EBITDA is a key non-GAAP financial measure used by the CEO to assess the operating performance of Cleco s segments; however, it is not indicative of future performance. Management evaluates the performance of Cleco s segments and allocates resources to them based on segment profit and the requirements to implement strategic initiatives and projects to meet current business objectives. EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

 The narrative analysis referenced above should be read in combination with Cleco Power s Financial Statements and the Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 

For more information on Cleco s accounting policies, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Cleco believes that the following accounting estimates are the most significant in understanding reported financial results: 
 
 Regulatory Accounting: A significant portion of Cleco s businesses are subject to regulation. This results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses. Cleco Power is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of Cleco s businesses. Cleco s management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment. For more information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of 

41 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Significant Accounting Policies Regulation, and Note 5 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities. 
 
 Goodwill: On April 13, 2016, in connection with the completion of the 2016 Merger, Cleco recognized goodwill of 1.49 billion, all of which was assigned to the Cleco Power reporting unit. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates, including the identification of reporting units, assignments of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units, in which independent valuation experts are often used. Changes in management s assumptions and estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment. For more information on goodwill recorded in connection with the 2016 Merger, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 17 Intangible Assets, Intangible Liabilities, and Goodwill Goodwill. 
 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: To determine assets, liabilities, and expenses relating to pension and other postretirement benefits, management must make assumptions about future trends. Assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, future rate of compensation increases, and medical inflation trend rates. These assumptions are reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Changes in the rates from year-to-year and newly-enacted laws could have a material effect on Cleco s financial condition and results of operations by changing the recorded assets, liabilities, expense, or required funding of the pension plan obligation. One component of pension expense is the expected return on plan assets. It is an assumed percentage return on the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan assets differs from the fair value of plan assets by the amount of deferred asset gains or losses. Actual asset returns that differ from the expected return on plan assets are deferred and recognized in the market-related value of assets on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. The 2022 return on plan assets was (19.94) compared to an expected long-term return of 5.25 . For 2021, the plan assets had a return of 7.14 compared to an expected long-term return of 5.00 . For the calculation of the 2023 periodic expense, Cleco increased the expected long-term return on plan assets to 6.60 . 
 Management uses a theoretical bond portfolio in order to calculate the discount rate for the measurement of liabilities. As a result of the annual review of assumptions, the pension plan discount rate increased from 2.98 to 5.44 for the December 31, 2022, measurement of liabilities. 
 A change in the assumed discount rate creates a deferred actuarial gain or loss. Generally, when the assumed discount rate decreases compared to the prior measurement date, a deferred actuarial loss is created. When the assumed discount rate increases compared to the prior measurement date, a deferred actuarial gain is created. 

Actuarial gains and losses also are created when actual results, such as compensation increases, differ from assumptions. On December 31, 2022, Cleco Power recognized a 58.1 million net actuarial gain primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and lower than expected return on assets. Historically, Cleco Power has been allowed to recover pension plan expenses; therefore, deferred actuarial gains and losses are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. The net of the deferred gains and losses is amortized to pension expense over the average service life of the remaining plan participants (approximately five years as of December 31, 2022, for Cleco s plan) when it exceeds certain thresholds. This approach of amortizing gains and losses has the effect of reducing the volatility of pension expense. Over time, it is not expected to reduce or increase the pension expense relative to an approach that immediately recognizes losses and gains. 
 The following table shows the impact of a 0.5 change in Cleco s pension plan discount rate, salary scale, and rate of return on plan assets: 
 
 ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTION (THOUSANDS) CHANGE IN ASSUMPTION CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION CHANGE IN ESTIMATED BENEFIT COST Discount rate 0.5 increase (27,009) 426 0.5 decrease 29,758 (509) Salary scale 0.5 increase 4,053 401 0.5 decrease (3,744) (369) Expected return on assets 0.5 increase (2,245) 0.5 decrease 2,245 
 
 Cleco Power did not make any required or discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2022 or 2021 and made a 15.8 million required contribution to the pension plan in December 2020. Based on funding assumptions at December 31, 2022, management estimates that 74.5 million of pension contributions will be required through 2027. Cleco has not made, and does not expect to make, any contributions to the pension plan in 2023. Future discretionary contributions may be made depending on changes in assumptions, the ability to utilize the contribution as a tax deduction, and requirements concerning recognizing a minimum pension liability. Future required contributions are driven by liability funding target percentages set by law which could cause the required contributions to change from year-to-year. The ultimate amount and timing of the contributions will be affected by changes in the discount rate, changes in the funding regulations, and actual returns on fund assets. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions.

 Loss Contingencies: Cleco is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and management has estimated the probable costs for the resolution of these claims. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement assumptions. For more information on legal proceedings affecting Cleco, see Part I, Item 1, Business Environmental Matters Air Quality, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Litigation, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation. 
 
 Cleco Power 
 Cleco Power s retail rates are regulated by the LPSC and its tariffs for transmission services are regulated by FERC, while rates for wholesale power sales are based on market-based rates and ultimately reviewed by FERC. Cleco Power must evaluate its various transactions related to regulatory orders and accounting guidance to ensure the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, the evaluation of cost deferral and the recoverability and refund of certain assets. Future rate changes could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of Cleco Power. Areas that could be materially impacted by future actions of regulators are described below: 
 
 The LPSC allows Cleco Power to recover prudent costs incurred in developing long-lived assets. If the LPSC were to rule that the cost of current or future long-lived assets was imprudent and not recoverable, Cleco Power could be required to write down the imprudent cost and incur a corresponding impairment loss. On September 21, 2022, the LPSC approved a settlement regarding the St. Mary Clean Energy Center disallowing recovery of 15.0 million, which resulted in a net 13.8 million impairment charge and a reduction of the associated property, plant, and equipment net book value. For more information on the impairment loss and disallowance see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews St. Mary Clean Energy Center. 
 
 The LPSC determines the amount and type of fuel and purchased power expenses that Cleco Power can charge customers through the FAC. Changes in the determination of allowable costs already incurred by Cleco Power could cause material changes in fuel revenue. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC, which are performed at least every other year. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, by the LPSC related to these filings. For more information on current LPSC fuel audits, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Fuel Audits.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks 

Credit Ratings and Counterparties 
 Financing for operational needs and capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows depends upon the cost and availability of external funds through both short- and long-term financing. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms could negatively affect Cleco s ability to maintain or expand its businesses. Access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic and capital market conditions, regulatory authorizations and policies, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power s credit ratings, cash flows from routine operations, and credit ratings of project counterparties. After assessing the current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power, management believes that Cleco will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings. The following table presents the credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power at December 31, 2022: 
 
 SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT CORPORATE/LONG-TERM ISSUER S P MOODY S FITCH S P MOODY S FITCH Cleco Holdings BBB- Baa3 BBB- BBB- Baa3 BBB- Cleco Power BBB+ A3 BBB+ BBB+ A3 BBB 
 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 On April 1, 2022, and following the LPSC s authorization of the securitization financing of Cleco Power s storm restoration costs, S P revised its outlook on Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power to stable from negative. S P revised its outlook due to its expectation that Cleco s financial metrics and balance sheet would improve given the upcoming securitization of storm restoration costs. On June 22, 2022, the storm recovery securitization financing was completed. 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power pay fees and interest under their bank credit agreements based on the highest rating held. If Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power s credit ratings were to be downgraded, Cleco Holdings or Cleco Power, respectively, could be required to pay additional fees and incur higher interest rates for borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities. 
 Cleco may be required to provide credit support with respect to any open trading contracts that Cleco has or may initiate in the future. The amount of credit support that Cleco may be required to provide at any point in the future is dependent on the notional value of the initial contract, changes in forward market prices, changes in the volume of open contracts, changes in credit ratings or credit quality where netting agreements are in place, and changes in the amount counterparties owe Cleco. Changes in any of these factors could cause the amount of requested credit support to increase or decrease.

 Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun participate in the MISO market. MISO requires Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun to provide credit support which may increase or decrease due to the timing of the settlement schedules and MISO margining formulas. For more information about MISO, see Regulatory and Other Matters Transmission Rates. For more information about credit support, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees. 

Global and U.S. Economic Environment 
 Global and domestic economic conditions may have an impact on Cleco s business and financial condition. Access to capital markets is a significant source of funding for both short- and long-term capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. During periods of capital market volatility, the availability of capital could be limited and the costs of capital may increase for many companies. Although the Registrants have not experienced restrictions in the financial markets, their ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when the Registrants would like, or need, to do so. Any restrictions could have a material impact on the Registrants ability to fund capital expenditures or debt service, or on their flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Credit constraints could have a material, negative impact on the Registrants lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to the Registrants or to delay payment of such obligations. The rising interest rates the Registrants have recently been exposed to have negatively affected interest expense on variable rate debt and positively affected interest income for the Registrants short-term investments. 
 Recently, inflationary pressures have increased substantially. Under established regulatory practice, historical costs have traditionally formed the basis for recovery from customers. As a result, Cleco Power s future cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may not be adequate to replace property, plant, and equipment in future years. For information on the impacts of inflation and market price volatility of natural gas on credit loss reserves related to customer accounts receivable, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reserves for Credit Losses and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors General Risk Factors Global Economic Uncertainty and Access to Capital. 

TCJA 
 The provisions of the TCJA reduced the top federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 . On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, which included the settlement of the TCJA protected and unprotected excess ADIT. As a result of this settlement, all retail customers will continue receiving bill credits resulting from the TCJA. For more information on the regulatory impact of the TCJA, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 13 Regulation and Rates Regulatory Refunds TCJA. 

Fair Value Measurements 
 Various accounting pronouncements require certain assets and liabilities to be measured at their fair values. Cleco may be required to provide credit support with respect to any open trading contracts that Cleco has entered into or may enter into in the future. The amount of credit support that Cleco may be required to provide at any point in the future is dependent on the amount of the initial contract, changes in the market price, changes in open contracts, changes in the amounts counterparties owe to Cleco, and any prenegotiated unsecured thresholds agreed to in the master contract. For more information about fair value instruments, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 7 Fair Value Accounting Instruments.

These decreases were partially offset by the issuance of Cleco Securitization I s 425.0 million initial principal amount of storm recovery bonds in June 2022. For more information on Cleco s debt, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 9 Debt.

 At December 31, 2022, Cleco had a working capital deficit of 88.8 million. At December 31, 2021, Cleco had a working capital surplus of 254.8 million. The 343.6 million decrease in working capital is primarily due to: 
 
 a 247.4 million increase in long-term debt due within one year, primarily due to the reclassification of Cleco Holdings' 165.0 million senior notes due in May 2023, Cleco Power's 100.0 million senior notes due in December 2023, and 9.6 million of Cleco Securitization I's storm recovery bond principal payments scheduled to be paid in March and September 2023, partially offset by the repayment of Cleco Power's 25.0 million senior notes in December 2022, 
 a 109.0 million increase in short-term debt due to outstanding draws on revolving credit facilities, 
 a 90.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, 
 a 45.7 million decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies primarily due to recognition of death benefits, the receipt of a portion of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and unfavorable market conditions, 
 a 23.6 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to higher MISO power purchases and higher coal transportation costs due to higher gas prices, 
 an 11.1 million increase in taxes payable primarily due to higher accruals for federal and state income taxes and payroll taxes, and 
 a 10.3 million increase in interest accrued primarily due to Cleco Securitization I's storm recovery bonds issued in June 2022. 
 
 These decreases in working capital were partially offset by: 
 
 a 49.8 million increase in affiliate balances primarily due to the settlement of intercompany taxes payable and income tax payments made on behalf of Cleco Group, 
 a 34.0 million increase in customer accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in revenue due to higher usage as a result of weather and timing of collections from customers, 
 a 21.9 million increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily due to amounts restricted for storm restoration costs, 
 a 21.4 million increase in fuel inventory primarily due to higher petroleum coke volume at a higher price per ton at Cleco Power and higher coal volume with higher transportation costs at Cleco Cajun, 
 a 17.5 million increase in materials and supplies inventory primarily due to higher purchases at higher costs per unit, 
 a 17.9 million increase in regulatory assets primarily due to the reclassification of the short-term portion of the regulatory assets related to Hurricane Ida deferred storm restoration costs under prudency review, Madison Unit 3 property taxes, and Bayou Vista to Segura, 
 a 15.1 million increase in other accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in the timing of collections of joint owner receivables at Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun and an increase in receivables related to higher mine costs, and 
 a 9.3 million increase in energy risk management assets, excluding Cleco Power s FTRs, primarily due to market value changes on gas-related derivative contracts at Cleco Cajun. 

At December 31, 2022, Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected 5.31 billion of total liabilities compared to 5.17 billion at December 31, 2021. The 135.8 million increase in total liabilities during 2022 was primarily due to: 
 
 an increase in restricted storm reserve of 109.4 million due to the securitization financing of Cleco Power s storm restoration costs through Cleco Securitization I in June 2022, 
 an increase in short-term debt of 109.0 million, as previously discussed, 
 an increase in accumulated deferred federal and state income taxes, net of 64.5 million, primarily due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward, 
 an increase in accounts payable of 23.6 million, as previously discussed, 
 an increase in taxes payable of 11.1 million, as previously discussed, and 
 an increase in interest accrued of 10.3 million, as previously discussed. 
 
 These increases in total liabilities were partially offset by: 
 
 a decrease in regulatory liabilities of 52.7 million, primarily due to amortization of excess ADIT related to the TCJA, and 
 a decrease in affiliate accounts payable of 38.2 million primarily due to the settlement of intercompany taxes payable.

 Net Financing Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during 2021 increased 59.1 million from 2020 primarily due to the issuance of 325.0 million floating rate senior notes at Cleco Power in September 2021. 
 
 This increase was partially offset by: 
 
 the absence of borrowing a 125.0 million term loan at Cleco Power in August 2020, 
 higher payments on revolving credit facilities of 97.0 million, and 
 lower draws on revolving credit facilities of 53.0 million. 
 
 Cleco Power 
 
 Net Operating Cash Flow 
 Cash generated from operating activities consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses, non-cash income, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments include items such as depreciation and amortization, regulatory disallowance, deferred income taxes, and allowance for equity funds used during construction. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during 2021 decreased 25.3 million from 2020 primarily due to: 
 
 higher fuel costs of 113.4 million primarily due to accelerated mine closure costs, 
 higher recoverable fuel and purchased power costs of 25.3 million primarily associated with Winter Storms Uri and Viola not yet collected from customers, 
 lower collections from joint owners of 5.1 million primarily due to timing of receipts for their portions of generating station expenses, and 
 the absence of Cleco Katrina/Rita storm restoration surcharge collections from customers of 2.4 million as a result of the final principal and interest payment on the Cleco Katrina/Rita bonds in March 2020.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 
 lower payments for affiliate settlements of 55.5 million, 
 lower payments for non-capital storm restoration costs of 33.3 million, 
 the absence of pension plan contributions of 15.8 million at Cleco Power 
 higher collections from customers of 9.3 million due to timing, and 
 lower payments to vendors of 4.8 million primarily due to timing of payments related to other operating and maintenance activities. 
 
 Net Investing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in investing activities during 2021 decreased 75.2 million from 2020 primarily due to higher additions to property, plant, and equipment, excluding AFUDC, of 76.1 million. 
 
 Net Financing Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during 2021 increased 59.6 million from 2020 primarily due to: 
 
 the issuance of 325.0 million floating rate senior notes in September 2021, 
 higher draws on credit facilities of 35.0 million, and 
 the absence of the final repayment of Cleco Katrina/Rita storm recovery bonds of 11.1 million. 
 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 
 higher payments on revolving credit facilities of 185.0 million and 
 the absence of borrowing a 125.0 million term loan in August 2020. 

Capital Expenditures 
 Cleco s capital expenditures are primarily incurred at Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. Cleco Power s capital expenditures relate primarily to assets that may be included in Cleco Power s rate base and, if considered prudent by the LPSC, can be recovered from its customers. Those assets also earn a rate of return authorized by the LPSC and are subject to the FRP. Such assets primarily consist of improvements to Cleco Power s distribution system, transmission system, and generating stations as well as hardware and software upgrades. Cleco Cajun s capital expenditures primarily consist of improvements to Cleco Cajun s transmission system and generating stations as well as hardware and software upgrades. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Cleco Power had capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, of 228.9 million, 301.0 million, and 377.0 million, respectively. Cleco Power funded its capital expenditures for 2022, 2021, and 2020 from internally generated funds and funds obtained through debt issuances. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, other subsidiaries had capital expenditures of 7.8 million, 10.2 million, and 12.0 million, respectively. 
 In 2023 and for the five-year period ending 2027, Cleco and Cleco Power expect to materially fund their capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds. However, Cleco Power may choose to issue debt in order to supplement its funding sources and achieve its stipulated 

regulatory capital structure. All computations of internally funded capital expenditures exclude AFUDC and capitalized interest. 
 Cleco s and Cleco Power s estimated capital expenditures and debt maturities for 2023 and for the five-year period ending December 31, 2027, are presented in the following tables. All amounts exclude AFUDC and capitalized interest.

Capital expenditures for other subsidiaries in 2023 are estimated to total 13.0 million. For the five-year period ending December 31, 2027, capital expenditures for other subsidiaries are estimated to total 67.0 million. Cleco expects cash and cash equivalents on hand, in addition to cash generated from operations, borrowings from credit facilities, and the net proceeds of any issuances of debt securities, to be adequate to fund normal ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. 

Other Cash Requirements 
 Cleco Power s regulated operations and Cleco Cajun s unregulated operations are Cleco s primary sources of internally generated funds. These funds, along with issuances of additional debt received in future years, will be used for general company purposes, capital expenditures, debt service, human capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and off-balance sheet arrangements, if required. 
 Cleco also anticipates receipt of grant funds in the future 
 for renewable and electrification projects, including Project

 Diamond Vault. For more information on renewable and 
 electrification initiatives see Overview Cleco Power Renewable and Electrification Initiatives. 

Contractual Obligations 
 Cleco, in the course of normal business activities, enters into a variety of contractual obligations. Some of these result in direct obligations that are reflected in Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheets while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These obligations do not include amounts for ongoing needs for which no contractual 

obligation existed as of December 31, 2022, and represent only the projected future payments that Cleco was contractually obligated to make as of December 31, 2022. 
 For contractual obligations related to leases, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 3 Leases.

 For purposes of this table, it is assumed that all terms and rates related to the above obligations will remain the same and all franchises will be renewed according to the rates used in the table. 

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees 
 Cleco has entered into various off-balance sheet commitments in the form of guarantees and standby letters of credit in order to facilitate its activities and the activities of its equity investees (affiliates). Cleco has also agreed to contractual terms that require it to pay third parties if certain triggering events occur. These contractual terms generally are defined as guarantees. For more information about off-balance sheet commitments and guarantees, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees. 

Cybersecurity 
 The operation of Cleco s electrical systems relies on evolving operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are complex. The failure of Cleco or its vendors operational and information technology systems and networks, due to a physical attack, cyberattack, or other event, could significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; result in damage to Cleco s assets or operations, or those of third parties; result in damage to Cleco s reputation; and subject Cleco to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Cleco continues to assess its cybersecurity tools and processes and has taken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. Cleco s Chief Information and Supply Chain Officer leads Cleco s cybersecurity team and oversees Cleco s cybersecurity maturity plan. Each month, management provides cybersecurity key performance indicator updates to Cleco s Asset Management Committee and periodically provides general cybersecurity updates to 

Cleco s Audit Committee. Cleco s third party providers are susceptible to data breaches, which could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the third party servers on which the products run. Cleco could have potential impacts to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of its data or systems. The third party providers and Cleco investigate data breach incidents. Past instances have resulted in no negative impacts to Cleco s confidentiality, integrity, or availability of its data or systems. For more information on risks related to Cleco s cybersecurity, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Operational Risks Technology and Terrorism Threats.

 Transmission Rates 
 In July 2011, FERC issued Order No. 1000 that reformed the electric transmission planning and cost allocation requirements for public utility transmission providers. The rule builds on the reforms of Order No. 890 and corrects remaining deficiencies 

50 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 with respect to transmission planning processes and cost allocation methods. In 2015, MISO and the Southwest Power Pool made separate filings containing different metrics to meet specific requirements. A compliance determination for both filings has not been made and no timetable is available for when a determination will be made. Until a determination is made, Cleco is unable to determine if this order will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun s generation dispatch and transmission operations are integrated with MISO. MISO operates a fully functioning RTO market with two major market processes: the Day-Ahead Energy and Operating Reserves Market and the Real-Time Energy and Operating Reserves Market. Both use market-based mechanisms to manage transmission congestion across the MISO market area. For more information about the risks associated with Cleco s participation in MISO, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Regulatory Risks MISO. 
 For information on Cleco Power s and Cleco Cajun s transmission rates, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 4 Revenue Recognition Transmission Revenue. 

Market Structure 
 
 Wholesale Electric Markets 
 
 RTO 
 In 1999, FERC issued Order No. 2000, which established a general framework for all transmission-owning entities in the nation to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of an appropriate RTO. Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun s generation dispatch and transmission operations are integrated with MISO. For more information about Cleco Power s and Cleco Cajun s integration into MISO, see Transmission Rates. 
 
 ERO 
 NERC, subject to oversight by FERC, is the ERO responsible for developing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards for users, owners, and operators of the bulk power system. NERC, as the ERO, delegates authority to SERC Reliability Corporation. 
 Cleco anticipates that a new standard relating to the winterization of generation assets will be approved by FERC in 2023. This standard is expected to have more stringent requirements; however, Cleco cannot predict the full impact that this potential new standard will have on its businesses, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 A NERC Operations and Planning Reliability Standards audit is co nducted every three years for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. The most recent NERC Operations and Planning Reliability Standards audits for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun concluded on September 15, 2022. Final reports were issued on October 25, 2022, for Cleco Cajun and November 16, 2022, for Cleco Power. There were no material findings from the audits. 
 A NERC CIP audit is also conducted every three years for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun. NERC CIP audits for Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun began in the fourth quarter of 2022 and are expected to conclude in the first quarter 2023. 

Management is unable to predict the final financial outcome of the most recent CIP audits, any future audits, or whether any findings will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financ ial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For a discussion of risks associated with FERC s regulation of Cleco Power s transmission system, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors Regulatory Risks Reliability and CIP Standards Compliance . 
 
 Retail Electric Markets 
 Currently, the LPSC does not provide exclusive service territories for electric utilities under its jurisdiction. Instead, retail service is obtained through a long-term nonexclusive franchise. The LPSC uses a 300-foot rule for determining the supplier for new customers. The 300-foot rule requires a customer to take service from the electric utility that is within 300 feet of the respective customer. If the customer is beyond 300 feet from any existing utility service, they may choose their electric supplier. The LPSC s review of the 300-foot rule in Docket No. R-32763 has been ongoing since April 2013. On February 5, 2020, the docket was closed due to no substantive actions in proceedings since October 2014. Management is unable to predict if this docket will be reopened for reconsideration in the future and cannot determine the impact any potential rulemaking may have on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of Cleco Power. The application of the current rule has led to competition with neighboring utilities for retail customers at the borders of Cleco Power s service areas. Cleco Power also competes in its service area with suppliers of alternative forms of energy, some of which may be less costly than electricity for certain applications. Cleco Power could experience some competition for electric sales to industrial customers in the form of cogeneration. 

Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 
 On October 20, 2021, Cleco Power filed its request with the LPSC to initiate its next IRP process. Cleco Power filed its initial data assumptions to be used in its IRP analysis on February 21, 2022. The IRP process includes conducting stakeholder meetings and receiving feedback from stakeholders. The first stakeholders meeting was conducted on March 24, 2022. The first draft of the IRP was filed on October 26, 2022. The next stakeholders meeting was held on November 29, 2022. A final IRP is due in May 2023. 
 The IRP report describes how Cleco Power plans to meet its forecasted load requirements on a reliable and economic basis, while reducing Cleco Power s carbon footprint. The IRP is used as a guide in future decision-making and does not represent firm operational commitments. 
 
 Service Quality Plan (SQP) 
 In October 2015, the LPSC proposed an SQP containing 21 requirements for Cleco Power. The SQP has provisions relating to employee headcount, customer service, reliability, vegetation management, and reporting. In April 2016, the SQP was approved by the LPSC. The SQP expired on December 31, 2020. Cleco Power is currently working to complete a new five-year program to submit to the LPSC for approval. On April 29, 2022, Cleco Power filed its annual SQP monitoring report for 2021 based on the expired reporting requirements.

Recent Authoritative Guidance 
 For a discussion of recent authoritative guidance, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Authoritative Guidance. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

RISK OVERVIEW 
 Cleco is exposed to counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk. Cleco has implemented a governance framework, inclusive of risk policies and procedures to help manage these and other risks. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 When Cleco enters into commodity derivative or physical commodity transactions directly with market participants, Cleco may be exposed to counterparty credit risk. Cleco is exposed to counterparty credit risk when a counterparty fails to meet their financial obligations causing Cleco to incur replacement cost losses. Cleco enters into master agreements with counterparties that govern the risk of credit default and allow for collateralization above prenegotiated thresholds to help mitigate potential losses. Alternatively, Cleco may be required to provide credit support or pay liquidated damages with respect to any open trading contracts that Cleco has entered into or may enter into in the future. The amount of credit support that Cleco may be required to provide at any point in the future is dependent on the amount of the initial contract, changes in the market price, changes in open contracts, changes in the amounts counterparties owe to Cleco, and any prenegotiated unsecured thresholds agreed to in the master contract. Changes in any of these factors could cause the amount of requested credit support to increase or decrease. 
 Cleco monitors and manages its credit risk exposure through credit risk management policies and procedures that include: 
 
 routine review of counterparty credit quality and credit exposure, 
 entering into industry standard master agreements with specific terms and conditions for credit exposure and non-performance, 
 measuring expected and potential future exposure regularly, and 
 exchanging guarantees or forms of cash equivalent collateral for financial assurance. 
 
 For more information, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Access to capital markets is a significant source of funding for both short- and long-term capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruption in the capital and credit markets may potentially increase the costs of capital and limit the ability to access the capital markets. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms could negatively affect Cleco s 

ability to maintain and expand its business. After assessing the current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings of Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power, management believes that Cleco will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings. For more information, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources General Considerations and Credit-Related Risks. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Cleco monitors its mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix, for example, refinancing balances outstanding under its variable-rate bank facilities with fixed-rate debt or vice versa. Calculations of the changes in fair market value and interest expense of the debt securities are made over a one-year period. 
 Sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable-rate obligations is computed by assuming a 1 change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cleco Holdings had 64.0 million of short-term debt outstanding under its 175.0 million revolving credit facility at a weighted average all-in interest rate of 5.977 . At December 31, 2022, the borrowing costs for amounts drawn under Cleco Holdings revolving credit facility were equal to LIBOR plus 1.625 or ABR plus 0.625 , plus commitment fees of 0.275 paid on the unused portion of the facility. Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco Holdings short-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco Holdings pretax earnings of 0.6 million on an annualized basis. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cleco Holdings had a 132.3 million long-term variable rate bank term loan outstanding at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.625 , for an all-in interest rate of 6.015 . Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco Holdings long-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco Holdings pretax earnings of 1.3 million on an annualized basis. The weighted average rate for the outstanding term loan debt at Cleco Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 3.321 . 
 At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had 45.0 million of short-term debt outstanding under its 300.0 million revolving credit facility at an all-in interest rate of 5.57 . At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power s borrowing costs for amounts drawn under its 300.0 million revolving credit facility were equal to LIBOR plus 1.25 or ABR plus 0.25 , plus commitment fees of 0.15 paid on the unused portion of the facility. Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco Power s short-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco Power s pretax earnings of 0.5 million on an annualized basis. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a 125.0 million long-term variable rate bank term loan outstanding, at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.25 , for an all-in interest rate of 

52 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 5.64 . Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco Power s long-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco Power s pretax earnings of 1.3 million on an annualized basis. The weighted average rate for the outstanding term loan debt at Cleco Power for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 2.967 . 
 Each 1 increase in the interest rate applicable to Cleco s short- and long-term variable rate debt would result in a decrease in Cleco s consolidated pretax earnings of 3.7 million on an annualized basis. 
 Cleco may enter into contracts to mitigate the volatility in interest rate risk. These contracts include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks. For each reporting period presented, the Registrants did not enter into any contracts to mitigate the volatility in interest rate risk. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Cleco s financial performance can be impacted by changes in commodity prices that can impact fuel costs, generation revenue, costs to serve its contracted wholesale electricity customers, and revenue from those customers. Cleco s risk management policies and procedures authorize hedging commodity price risk with physical or financially settled derivative instruments within approved guidelines and limits of authority. Some of these transactions may qualify for the normal purchase, normal sale (NPNS) exception under derivative accounting guidance. Contracts that do not qualify for NPNS accounting treatment or are not elected for NPNS accounting treatment are marked-to-market and recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. 
 Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun, each separately and individually, may be exposed to transmission congestion price risk as a result of physical transmission constraints present between MISO LMP nodes when serving customer load. Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun are awarded and/or purchase FTRs in auctions facilitated by MISO. FTRs are accounted for as derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. 

During 2022, Cleco Cajun had natural gas derivative contracts consisting of fixed price physical forwards and financially settled swap transactions. During 2022, Cleco Power had natural gas derivative contracts consisting of financially settled swap transactions. 
 Cleco monitors the Value at Risk (VaR) of its natural gas derivative contracts requiring derivative accounting treatment. VaR is defined as the minimum expected loss over a given holding period at a given confidence level based on observable market price volatilities. Cleco uses a parametric variance-covariance model methodology to estimate VaR. VaR is calculated using historical volatilities within a 5-day holding period at a 95 confidence interval. Given Cleco s reliance on historical data, VaR is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or abnormal shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors, even when weighted toward more recent observations, may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. VaR should be evaluated in light of this and the methodology s other limitations. The following table presents the VaR of natural gas derivative contracts based on these assumptions: 
 
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DEC. 31, 2022 (THOUSANDS) AT DEC. 31, 2022 HIGH LOW AVERAGE Cleco 26,128 79,618 22,142 42,657 Cleco Power 3,464 5,370 1,117 1,982

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Managers and Member of 
 Cleco Corporate Holdings LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cleco Corporate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in member s equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 As described in Notes 2 and 17 to th e consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 1.49 billion a t December 31, 2022, all of which was assigned to the Cleco Power reporting unit. Management conducts an impairment test as of August 1 of each year, or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Fair value is estimated by management using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimates include estimation of future cash flows related to capital expenditures, long-term rate of growth, and discount rate. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Cleco Power reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to capital expenditures, long-term rate of growth, and discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management relating to capital expenditures, long-term rate of growth, and discount rate. Evaluating management s assumptions related to the capital expenditures and projected long-term rate of growth involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by 

54 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 management were reasonable considering, as applicable, (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and modeled rate base changes, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company s discounted cash flow model and the long-term rate of growth and discount rate assumptions. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 As described in Notes 2 and 5 to th e consolidated financial statements, Cleco Power LLC Cleco Power ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). Cleco Power s retail rates are regulated by the LPSC and its tariffs for transmission services are regulated by FERC, while rates for wholesale power sales are based on market-based rates and are ultimately reviewed by FERC. Cleco Power must evaluate its various transactions related to regulatory orders and accounting guidance to ensure the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, the evaluation of cost deferral, and the recoverability and refund of certain assets. Cleco Power capitalizes or defers certain costs for recovery from customers and recognizes a liability for amounts expected to be returned to customers based on regulatory approval and management s ongoing assessment that it is probable these items will be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process. As of December 31, 2022, there we re 717.0 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and 152.8 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting cash outflow or potential refund. Under the current regulatory environment, Cleco Power believes these regulatory assets will be fully recoverable; however, if in the future, as a result of regulatory changes or competition, Cleco Power s ability to recover these regulatory assets would no longer be probable, then to the extent that such regulatory assets were determined not to be recoverable, 

Cleco Power would be required to write-down such assets. Further, potential deregulation of the industry or possible future changes in the method of rate regulation of Cleco Power could require discontinuance of the application of the authoritative guidance of regulated operations. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in evaluating the impact of regulatory orders and accounting guidance on relevant transactions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the timing of revenue recognition, the evaluation of cost deferral, and the recoverability and refund of certain assets. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, evaluating (i) management s process for identifying relevant transactions which require regulatory treatment; (ii) management s assessment regarding the accounting impacts arising from regulatory orders and accounting guidance; (iii) the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding the timing of revenue recognition, probability of recovery of regulatory assets, and the establishment of regulatory liabilities; and (iv) the regulatory assets and liabilities calculated by management based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Managers and Member of 
 Cleco Power LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cleco Power LLC and its subsidiaries (the Company or Cleco Power as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in member s equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 

financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 As describe d in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by its regulatory commissions, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). The Company s retail rates are regulated by the LPSC and its tariffs for transmission services are regulated by FERC, while rates for wholesale power sales are based on market-based rates and are ultimately reviewed by FERC. The Company must evaluate its various transactions related to regulatory orders and accounting guidance to ensure the appropriate timing of revenue recognition, the evaluation of cost deferral, and the recoverability and refund of certain assets. The Company capitalizes or defers certain costs for recovery from customers and recognizes a liability for amounts expected to be returned to customers based on regulatory approval and management s ongoing assessment that it is probable these items will be recovered or refunded throu gh the ratemaking process. As of December 31, 2022, there were 589.3 million of deferred costs included in regulatory assets and 152.8 million of regulatory liabilities awaiting cash outflow or potential refund. Under the current regulatory environment, the Company believes these regulatory assets will be fully recoverable; however, if in the future, as a result of regulatory changes or competition, the Company s ability to recover these regulatory assets would no longer be probable, then to the extent that such regulatory assets were determined not to be recoverable, the Company would be required to write-down such assets. Further, potential deregulation of the industry or possible future changes in the method of rate regulation of the Company could require discontinuance of the application of the authoritative guidance of regulated operations. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in evaluating the impact of regulatory orders and accounting guidance on relevant transactions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the timing of revenue recognition, the evaluation of cost deferral, and the recoverability and refund of certain assets. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These

 Coughlin Transaction Costs 
 In January 2014, the LPSC authorized Cleco Power to create a regulatory asset for the transaction costs related to the transfer of Coughlin from Evangeline to Cleco Power. The Coughlin transaction costs are being recovered over a period beginning July 2014. 
 
 COVID-19 Executive Order 
 On March 13, 2020, the LPSC issued an executive order prohibiting the disconnection of utilities for nonpayment. This order resulted in an increase of expenses and a loss of revenue for Cleco Power. On April 29, 2020, the LPSC issued an order allowing utilities to establish a regulatory asset for expenses incurred from the suspension of disconnections and collection of late fees imposed by the LPSC executive order. On July 1, 2020, the LPSC issued an order terminating the moratorium on disconnections effective July 16, 2020. Cleco began resuming disconnections and late fees and utilizing collection agencies on October 1, 2020. On December 4, 2020, Cleco Power made a filing with the LPSC requesting the recovery of the regulatory asset as well as the lost revenue associated with the disconnection fees and incremental costs over a period.

 separate hurricanes, Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta, and Ida, and severe winter storms, Winter Storms Uri and Viola. Cleco Power established a separate regulatory asset to track and defer non-capital expenses associated with each corresponding storm, as approved by the LPSC. 
 On June 22, 2022, through Cleco Securitization I, Cleco Power completed a securitized financing of Storm Recovery Property, which included the previously mentioned storm restoration costs that were deferred as regulatory assets. In connection with that securitization financing, Cleco Securitization I used the net proceeds from its issuance of storm recovery bonds to purchase the Storm Recovery Property from Cleco Power. Prior to September 1, 2022, certain costs for Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta were recovered through the interim storm recovery rate. The balances remaining at December 30, 2022, for Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta are due to the timing of collections of the interim storm rate and are expected to be funded by the storm reserve, pending approval by the LPSC. The costs remaining at December 31, 2022, for Hurricane Ida are currently under a prudency review by the LPSC. Cleco Power is unable to determine the outcome or timing of such review. For more information on the storm recovery securitization financing, see Note 19 Securitization. 
 
 Dolet Hills Power Station Closure Costs 
 In June 2020, Cleco Power revised depreciation rates for the Dolet Hills Power Station to utilize the December 31, 2021, expected end-of-life and early retirement of the Dolet Hills Power Station and defer depreciation expense to a regulatory asset for the amount in excess of the previously LPSC-approved depreciation rates.

For more information on the Dolet Hills Power Station, see Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Risks and Uncertainties. For more information on the prudency review for these costs see, Risks and Uncertainties. 

Energy Efficiency 
 In December 2018, Cleco Power filed a letter of intent with the LPSC to recover the under recovery of the accumulated decrease in revenues, also known as the LCFC, associated with the energy efficiency program for years 2014 through 2018 to be recovered over a period. Cleco Power began collecting the accumulated LCFC revenues in Cleco Power s energy efficiency rates effective March 1, 2019. On October 21, 2019, Cleco Power received notice of approval from the LPSC allowing recovery of the accumulated LCFC revenues. 
 
 Financing Costs 
 In 2011, Cleco Power entered into and settled treasury rate locks. Of the million in settlements, million was deferred as a regulatory asset relating to ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships. Also in 2011, Cleco Power entered into a forward starting swap contract. These derivatives were entered into in order to mitigate the interest rate exposure on coupon payments related to forecasted debt issuances. In May 2013, the forward starting interest rate swap was settled at a loss of million. Cleco Power deferred million of the losses as a regulatory asset, which is being amortized over the terms of the related debt issuances. 
 
 Interest Costs 
 Cleco Power s deferred interest costs include additional deferred capital construction financing costs authorized by the LPSC. These costs are being amortized over the estimated lives of the respective assets. 
 
 Madison Unit 3 Property Taxes 
 On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s current retail rate plan. As a result, beginning July 1, 2022, Cleco Power is allowed to recover property taxes paid for Madison Unit 3, including a carrying charge at Cleco Power s weighted average cost of capital, grossed up for income taxes. The amount included in the cost recovery mechanism each year will amortize over months. 
 
 Non-Service Cost of Postretirement Benefits 
 On January 1, 2018, FASB s amended guidance related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans became effective. The amendment allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within property, plant, and equipment. Beginning January 1, 2018, Cleco Power s non-service cost previously eligible for capitalization into property, plant, and equipment are being deferred to a regulatory asset and will be amortized over the estimated lives of the respective assets. 
 
 Other 
 On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s current retail rate plan resulting in Cleco Power establishing several regulatory assets. Annually, Cleco Power is allowed to defer, as a regulatory asset, the undercollection of revenues related to the Northlake Transmission Agreement. The amount recorded in the regulatory asset will be amortized over the following regulatory period, beginning on July 1. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of million relating to the Northlake Transmission Agreement. 
 In addition, the LPSC approved recovery of other previously deferred costs associated with Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, which began being amortized over

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 on July 1, 2021. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of million for these deferred costs. 
 In June 2017, the LPSC approved the establishment of a regulatory asset upon the completion of the Coughlin Pipeline project for the revenue requirement associated with the project, until Cleco Power s current retail rate plan was approved. As approved by the LPSC in Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, the regulatory asset began being amortized over on July 1, 2021. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had a regulatory asset of million related to the deferred revenue associated with the Coughlin Pipeline project. 
 Effective for income tax periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Louisiana state corporate income tax rate was decreased from 8 to 7.5 and the state deduction for federal income taxes paid was eliminated. These changes resulted in an increase in income tax expense. Therefore, Cleco Power established a regulatory asset of million for the increased revenue requirements associated with the income tax expense in excess of the amount previously approved by the LPSC. Cleco Power plans to seek recovery of this regulatory asset in its next rate case, which is required to be filed by March 31, 2023. 
 
 Postretirement Costs 
 Cleco Power recognizes the funded status of its postretirement benefit plans as a net liability or asset. The net liability or asset is defined as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair market value of plan assets. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. Historically, the LPSC has allowed Cleco Power to recover pension plan expense. Cleco Power, therefore, recognizes a regulatory asset based on its determination that these costs can be collected from customers. These costs are amortized to pension expense over the average service life of the remaining plan participants (approximately as of December 31, 2022, for Cleco s plan) when it exceeds certain thresholds. The amount and timing of the recovery will be based on the changing funded status of the pension plan in future periods. For more information on Cleco s pension plan and adoption of these authoritative guidelines, see Note 10 Pension Plan and Employee Benefits. 
 
 Production Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
 Annually, Cleco Power is allowed to defer, as a regulatory asset, production operations and maintenance expenses, net of fuel and payroll, above the retail jurisdictional portion of million, adjusted annually for a growth factor (deferral threshold). The amount of the regulatory asset is capped at million. The LPSC allows Cleco Power to recover the amount deferred in any calendar year over the following regulatory period, beginning on July 1, when the annual rates are set. Cleco Power had a deferral of million in 2022 and a deferral of million in 2021. 
 
 Rodemacher Unit 2 Deferred Costs 
 As a result of environmental regulations enacted during 2020, Cleco Power revised Rodemacher Unit 2 s expected end-of-life to coincide with its application to the EPA for an alternative closure date of October 17, 2028. Rodemacher Unit 2 s depreciation expense in excess of the previously LPSC-approved depreciation rates are deferred to a regulatory asset. 

St. Mary Clean Energy Center 
 Cleco Power has a regulatory asset for the revenue requirements related to the planning and construction costs incurred for the St. Mary Clean Energy Center. As approved by the LPSC in Cleco Power s current retail rate plan, the regulatory asset began being amortized over on July 1, 2021. 
 On September 21, 2022, the LPSC approved a settlement disallowing recovery of million, which resulted in a million impairment charge and a reduction of the associated property, plant, and equipment net book value. The approved settlement also included refunding million to Cleco Power s retail customers. As a result, a regulatory asset of million was recognized for the incurred refund liability for retail revenues that will continue to be collected until Cleco Power s current base rates are reset in its next rate case, which is expected on July 1, 2024. On October 1, 2022, Cleco Power began amortizing the million regulatory asset to Electric customer credits on its Consolidated Statement of Income as amounts are collected from customers. For more information on the settlement and disallowance, see Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews St. Mary Clean Energy Center. 
 
 Training Costs 
 In 2008, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s request to establish a regulatory asset for training costs associated with existing processes and technology for new employees at Madison Unit 3. Recovery of these expenditures was approved by the LPSC in 2009. In 2010, Cleco Power began amortizing the regulatory asset over a -year period. 
 
 Tree Trimming Costs 
 In October 2016, the LPSC approved Cleco Power to defer and recover through its base rates tree trimming costs. The LPSC authorized a deferral up to million, excluding debt carrying costs. Cleco Power is currently collecting deferred tree trimming costs through its base rates and expects them to be fully amortized by 2026. 
 
 Cleco Holdings 2016 Merger Adjustments 
 As a result of the 2016 Merger, Cleco implemented acquisition accounting, which eliminated AOCI at the Cleco consolidated level on the date of the 2016 Merger. Cleco will continue to recover expenses related to certain postretirement costs; therefore, Cleco recognized a regulatory asset based on its determination that these costs that are probable of recovery continue to be collected from customers. These costs will be amortized to Other operations expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees. Cleco will also continue to recover financing costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks and a forward starting swap contract that were previously recognized in AOCI. Additionally, as a result of the 2016 Merger, a regulatory asset was recorded for debt issuance costs that were eliminated at Cleco and a regulatory asset was recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of long-term debt. These regulatory assets are being amortized over the terms of the related debt issuances, unless the debt is redeemed prior to maturity, at which time any unamortized related regulatory asset will be derecognized.

of employment with Cleco. Cleco s policy is to base its contributions to the employee pension plan upon actuarial computations utilizing the projected unit credit method, subject to the IRS s full funding limitation. Cleco did not make any required or discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2022 or 2021. In December 2020, Cleco made a million required contribution to the pension plan. Cleco has not made and does not expect to make any contributions in 2023. The required contributions are driven by liability funding target percentages set by law which could cause the required contributions to be uneven among the years. Based on the funding assumptions at December 31, 2022, management estimates that million in pension contributions will be required through 2027. Future discretionary contributions may be made depending on changes in assumptions, the ability to utilize the contribution as a tax deduction, and requirements concerning recognizing a minimum pension liability. Adverse changes in assumptions or adverse actual events could cause additional minimum contributions. The ultimate amount and timing of the contributions may be affected by changes in the discount rate, changes in the funding regulations, and actual returns on fund assets. Cleco Power is the plan sponsor and Support Group is the plan administrator.

Management reviews current market trends as it evaluates Cleco s future compensation strategy. 
 Cleco does not fund the SERP liability, but instead pays for current benefits out of the cash available of the respective company of the employed officer. Because the SERP is a non-qualified plan, Cleco has purchased life insurance policies on certain SERP participants as a mechanism to provide a source of funding. These polices are held in a rabbi trust formed by Cleco Power. The rabbi trust is the named beneficiary of the life insurance policies and, therefore, receives the proceeds upon death of the insured participants.

 In August 2019, the St. Mary Clean Energy Center was placed in service. The planning and construction costs for this facility 

are currently being recovered through Cleco Power s base rates and were subject to a prudency review by the LPSC. On September 21, 2022, the LPSC approved a settlement disallowing recovery of million of those costs, which resulted in a million impairment charge and a reduction of the associated property, plant, and equipment net book value. The approved settlement also included refunding million to Cleco Power s retail customers, which was given back to customers as bill credits in October 2022. For more information about the settlement and disallowance, see Note 15 Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees Litigation LPSC Audits and Reviews Prudency Reviews St. Mary Clean Energy Center. 
 
 TCJA 
 The provisions of the TCJA reduced the top federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 . In July 2019, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s rate refund of million, plus interest, for the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate for the period from January 2018 to June 2020. The refund was credited to customers over 12 months beginning August 1, 2019. 
 In 2020, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s extension of the TCJA bill credits at the same rate as determined in the initial TCJA refund of approximately million per month. The extension was for the period of August 2020 through June 30, 2021. The million monthly refund consisted of approximately million, which was to be funded by the unprotected excess ADIT, and approximately million, which is the change in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 . At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power had million accrued for the estimated federal tax-related benefits from the TCJA. 
 On June 16, 2021, the LPSC approved Cleco Power s current retail rate plan which includes the settlement of the TCJA protected and unprotected excess ADIT. Effective July 1, 2021, all retail customers will continue receiving bill credits resulting from the TCJA. The target retail portion of the unprotected excess ADIT is approximately million monthly and will be credited over a period of concluding on June 30, 2024. The retail portion of the protected excess ADIT will be credited until the full amount of the protected excess ADIT has been returned to Cleco Power s customers through bill credits.

actions were filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Louisiana and actions were filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana. The petitions in each action generally alleged, among other things, that the members of Cleco Corporation s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, conducting an allegedly inadequate sale process, agreeing to the 2016 Merger at a price that allegedly undervalued Cleco, and failing to disclose material information about the 2016 Merger. The petitions also alleged that Como 1, Cleco Corporation, Merger Sub, and, in some cases, certain of the investors in Como 1 either aided and abetted or entered into a civil conspiracy to advance those supposed breaches of duty. The petitions sought various remedies, including monetary damages, which includes attorneys fees and expenses. 
 The actions filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish are captioned as follows: 
 
 Braunstein v. Cleco Corporation , No. 251,383B (filed October 27, 2014), 
 Moore v. Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets , No. 251,417C (filed October 30, 2014), 
 Trahan v. Williamson , No. 251,456C (filed November 5, 2014), and 
 L Herisson v. Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets , No. 251,515F (filed November 14, 2014). 
 
 In November 2014, the plaintiff in the Braunstein action moved for a dismissal of the action without prejudice, and that motion was granted in November 2014. In December 2014, the court consolidated the remaining actions and appointed interim co-lead counsel, and dismissed the investors in Cleco Partners as defendants, per agreement of the parties. Also in December 2014, the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a Consolidated Amended Verified Derivative and Class Action Petition for Damages and Preliminary and Permanent Injunction. 
 The actions filed in the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish were captioned as follows: 
 
 Butler v. Cleco Corporation , No. 2014-10776 (filed November 7, 2014), 
 Creative Life Services, Inc. v. Cleco Corporation , No. 2014-11098 (filed November 19, 2014), and 
 Cashen v. Cleco Corporation , No. 2014-11236 (filed November 21, 2014). 

actions pending in Orleans Parish and to appoint interim co-lead plaintiffs and co-lead counsel. In January 2015, the Court in the Creative Life Services case sustained the defendants declinatory exceptions and dismissed the case so that it could be transferred to the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish. In February 2015, the plaintiffs in Butler and Cashen also consented to the dismissal of their cases from Orleans Parish so they could be transferred to the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish. By operation of the December 2014 order of the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, the Butler , Cashen , and Creative Life Services actions were consolidated into the actions pending in Rapides Parish. 
 In February 2015, the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish held a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs in the consolidated action seeking to enjoin the shareholder vote for approval of the Merger Agreement. The District Court heard and denied the plaintiffs motion. In June 2015, the plaintiffs filed their Second Consolidated Amended Verified Derivative and Class Action Petition. Cleco filed exceptions seeking dismissal of the second amended petition in July 2015. The LPSC voted to approve the 2016 Merger before the court could consider the plaintiffs peremptory exceptions. 
 In March 2016 and May 2016, the plaintiffs filed their Third Consolidated Amended Verified Derivative Petition for Damages and Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and their Fourth Verified Consolidated Amended Class Action Petition, respectively. The fourth amended petition, which remains the operative petition and was filed after the 2016 Merger closed, eliminated the request for preliminary and permanent injunction and also named an additional executive officer as a defendant. The defendants filed exceptions seeking dismissal of the fourth amended Petition. In September 2016, the District Court granted the exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action and dismissed all claims asserted by the former shareholders. The plaintiffs appealed the District Court s ruling to the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal. In December 2017, the Third Circuit Court of Appeal issued an order reversing and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In January 2018, Cleco filed a writ with the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking review of the Third Circuit Court of Appeal s decision. The writ was denied in March 2018 and the parties are engaged in discovery in the District Court. In November 2018, Cleco filed renewed exceptions of no cause of action and res judicata, seeking to dismiss all claims. On December 21, 2018, the court dismissed Cleco Partners and Cleco Holdings as defendants per the agreement of the parties, leaving as the only remaining defendants certain former executive officers and independent directors. The District Court denied the defendants exceptions on January 14, 2019. A hearing on the plaintiffs motion for certification of a class was scheduled for August 26, 2019; however, prior to the hearing, the parties reached an agreement to certify a limited class. On September 7, 2019, the District Court certified a class limited to shareholders who voted against, abstained from voting, or did not vote on the 2016 Merger. On October 18, 2021, the District Court issued

 million. Gulf Coast Spinning Company, LLC (Gulf Coast), the primary plaintiff, alleges that Cleco promised to assist it in raising approximately million, which Gulf Coast needed to construct a cotton spinning facility near Bunkie, Louisiana (the Bunkie project). According to the petition filed by Gulf Coast in the 12 th Judicial District Court for Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, Cleco made such promises of funding assistance in order to cultivate a new industrial electric customer which would increase its revenues under a power supply agreement that it executed with Gulf Coast. Gulf Coast seeks unspecified damages arising from its inability to raise sufficient funds to complete the project, including lost profits. 
 Cleco filed an Exception of No Cause of Action arguing that the case should be dismissed. The 12 th Judicial District Court denied Cleco s exception in December 2015, after considering briefs and arguments. In January 2016, Cleco appealed the District Court s denial of its exception by filing with the Third Circuit Court of Appeal. In June 2016, the Third Circuit Court of Appeal denied the request to have the case dismissed. In July 2016, Cleco filed a writ to the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking a review of the 12 th Judicial District Court s denial of Cleco s exception. In November 2016, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Cleco s writ application. 
 In February 2016, the parties agreed to a stay of all proceedings pending discussions concerning settlement. In May 2016, the 12 th Judicial District Court lifted the stay at the request of Gulf Coast. The parties are currently participating in discovery. 
 Diversified Lands loaned million to Gulf Coast for the Bunkie project. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the Bunkie project site. Diversified Lands foreclosed on the Bunkie property in February 2020 and has also asserted claims personally against the former owner of Gulf Coast. These claims are based on contracts and credit documents executed by Gulf Coast, the obligations and performance of which were personally guaranteed by the former owner of Gulf Coast. Diversified Lands is seeking recovery of the indebtedness still owed by Gulf Coast to Diversified Lands following the February 2020 foreclosure, which action has been consolidated with the litigation filed by Gulf Coast in the 12 th Judicial District Court for Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. Discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been set. 
 Cleco believes the allegations of the petition are contradicted by the written documents executed by Gulf Coast, are otherwise without merit, and that it has substantial meritorious defenses to the claims alleged by Gulf Coast. 
 
 Dispute with Saulsbury Industries 
 In October 2018, Cleco Power sued Saulsbury Industries, Inc., the former general contractor for the St. Mary Clean Energy Center project, seeking damages for Saulsbury Industries, Inc. s failure to complete the St. Mary Clean Energy Center project on time and for costs incurred by Cleco Power in hiring 

a replacement general contractor. The action was filed in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish, Saulsbury Industries, Inc. removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, on March 1, 2019. On September 14, 2020, Cabot Corporation was allowed to join the case pending in the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish. 
 In January 2019, Cleco Power was served with a summons in Saulsbury Industries, Inc. v. Cabot Corporation and Cleco Power LLC , in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Saulsbury Industries, Inc. alleged that Cleco Power and Cabot Corporation caused delays in the St. Mary Clean Energy Center project, resulting in alleged impacts to Saulsbury Industries, Inc. s direct and indirect costs. On June 5, 2019, Cleco Power and Cabot Corporation each filed separate motions to dismiss. On October 24, 2019, the District Court denied Cleco s motion as premature and ruled that Saulsbury Industries, Inc. had six weeks to conduct discovery on specified jurisdictional issues. The Magistrate Judge presiding over the Western District of Louisiana consolidated cases issued a report and recommendation to the District Judge that the case instituted by Saulsbury Industries, Inc. be dismissed without prejudice and the case initiated by Cleco Power be remanded to the Ninth Judicial District Court for Rapides Parish. Saulsbury Industries Inc. did not oppose the Magistrate Judge s report and recommendation, and the District Judge issued a ruling that adopted the Magistrate Judge s report and recommendation, which included reasoning consistent with Cleco Power s arguments. Thus, the federal consolidated cases are now closed. 
 On October 10, 2019, Cleco Power was served with a summons in Saulsbury Industries, Inc. v. Cabot Corporation and Cleco Power LLC in the 16 th Judicial District Court for St. Mary Parish. Saulsbury Industries, Inc. asserted the same claim as the Western District Litigation and further asserts claims for payment on an open account. On December 9, 2019, Cleco moved to stay the case, arguing that the Rapides Parish suit should proceed. On February 14, 2020, the court granted Cleco s motion. The 16 th Judicial District Court for the St. Mary Parish case held a hearing on October 16, 2020, and the judge granted Cleco s declinatory exceptions of lis pendens. Thus, the St. Mary s Parish case has been dismissed. Saulsbury appealed this decision. 
 On May 17, 2022, the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, ruled in favor of Cleco and affirmed the decision of the 16 th Judicial District Court for St. Mary Parish with respect to Cleco. However, the First Circuit Court reversed the 16 th Judicial District Court for St. Mary Parish s decision dismissing Cabot Corporation from the St. Mary Parish case. All parties filed applications for rehearing, which were denied on June 29, 2022. 
 Cabot Corporation applied for review by the Louisiana Supreme Court of the portion of the First Circuit Court's ruling that denied Cabot Corporation s exception seeking dismissal from the St. Mary Parish litigation. On November 1, 2022, the Louisiana Supreme Court rendered a decision in favor of Cabot Corporation. The Louisiana Supreme Court s decision reversed the First Circuit Court s decision and reinstated the decision of the 16 th Judicial District Court granting Cabot Corporation s declinatory exceptions of lis pendens. The St. Mary Parish case has been dismissed in full. 
 The stay was lifted in the Rapides Parish case and the Rapides Parish case is proceeding.

 million. On February 16, 2023, the LPSC approved the audit report indicating no material findings. Cleco Power has FAC filings for January 2020 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. Historically, the disallowances have not been material. If a disallowance of fuel cost is ordered resulting in a refund, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 On March 29, 2021, Cleco Power received approval from the LPSC to recover million of incremental fuel and purchased power costs incurred as a result of Winter Storms Uri and Viola over a period of 12 months beginning with the May 2021 bills. On May 11, 2021, Cleco Power received notice of an audit from the LPSC for the fuel costs incurred during the time period required to restore services to Cleco Power s customers during Winter Storms Uri and Viola. Cleco Power has responded to several data requests. Management is unable to determine the outcome or timing of the audit. 
 
 Environmental Audit 
 In 2009, the LPSC approved Cleco Power to recover from its customers certain costs of environmental compliance through an EAC. The costs eligible for recovery are those for prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal, state, and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances. Also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs, which are the costs of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are a part of the fuel mix used to reduce air emissions, among other things. Cleco Power has EAC filings for January 2020 and thereafter that remain subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance, if any, related to these filings. Historically, the disallowances have not been material. If a disallowance of environmental cost is ordered resulting in a refund to Cleco Power s customers, any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. 
 Cleco Power incurs environmental compliance expenses for reagents associated with the compliance standards of MATS. These expenses are also eligible for recovery through Cleco Power s EAC and are subject to periodic review by the LPSC. In May 2020, the EPA finalized a rule that concluded that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired electric generating units. However, the EPA concluded that coal- and oil-fired electric generating units would not be removed from the list of regulated sources of hazardous air pollutants and would remain subject to MATS. The EPA also determined that the 

results of its risk and technology review did not require any revisions to the emissions standards. Several petitions for review of the rule s findings were filed between May and July 2020 in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 20, 2021, the Presidential Administration issued an executive order, which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The order specifically directed the EPA to consider issuing a proposed rule to suspend, revise, or rescind the rule. The EPA determined the most environmentally protective course is to implement the rules in the executive order. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to revoke the agency s May 2020 finding with respect to whether it is appropriate and necessary to regulate coal and oil-fired generating units under MATS, but the EPA has not yet acted on a review of the risk and technology determination from the May 2020 rule. Management is unable to determine whether the outcome of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals review or the EPA s review of the rule as a result of the executive order will result in changes to the MATS standards. 
 
 Energy Efficiency Audit 
 In 2013, the LPSC issued a General Order adopting rules promoting energy efficiency programs. Cleco Power began participating in energy efficiency programs in November 2014. Through an approved rate tariff, Cleco Power recovered million and million for the 2022 and 2021 program years, respectively. 
 On June 9, 2021, the LPSC initiated an audit on program years 2019 and 2020 to consider all program costs. On September 14, 2022, the LPSC approved the audit report indicating no material findings. Program years 2021 and thereafter are subject to audit. Management is unable to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the outcome of this or any future audits. 
 Generally utility companies are allowed to recover from customers the accumulated decrease in revenues associated with the energy efficiency programs. On October 21, 2019, Cleco Power received notice of approval from the LPSC allowing recovery of the accumulated LCFC revenues when base rates reset, which took place on July 1, 2021. 
 
 Prudency Reviews 
 
 Deferred Lignite and Mine Closure Costs 
 Cleco Power is seeking recovery for deferred fuel and other mine-related closure costs. Recovery of these costs is subject to a prudency review by the LPSC, which is currently in progress. Cleco Power believes these costs are prudent and recoverable. However, initial testimony by the LPSC Staff advisors filed in August 2022 indicates disagreement with the prudency of these incurred costs. Cleco Power filed rebuttal testimony on September 23, 2022, rebutting the LPSC Staff s accusations of the lignite mining agreement not being approved by the LPSC, the prudency of the costs incurred, and the recoverability of such costs. A hearing date is scheduled in May 2023 and management expects the prudency review to be completed in the third quarter of 2023. Due to the nature and timing of the regulatory process, Cleco Power is currently unable to determine if any portion of the incurred costs will be disallowed for recovery but continues to assert that recovery of those costs is probable.

 million, which resulted in a million impairment charge and a reduction of the associated property, plant, and equipment net book value. The impairment charge is recorded in Regulatory disallowance on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Statements of Income. The settlement also resulted in a refund to Cleco Power s retail customers totaling million, which was given back to customers as bill credits in October 2022. The million refund consisted of million for costs recovered in periods prior to September 30, 2022, and million for costs to be recovered from October 1, 2022, until Cleco Power s base rates reset in its next rate case, which is expected to be on July 1, 2024. The refund of costs recovered prior to September 30, 2022, was recorded in Electric customer credits, with the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Balance Sheets. On October 1, 2022, Cleco Power began amortizing the regulatory asset to Electric customer credits on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 South Central Generating 
 Prior to the Cleco Cajun Transaction, South Central Generating was involved in various litigation matters, including environmental and contract proceedings, before various courts regarding matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2022, management estimates potential losses to be million with respect to one of these matters. Management is unable to estimate any potential losses Cleco Cajun may be ultimately responsible for with respect to any of the remaining matters. As part of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, NRG Energy indemnified Cleco for losses as of the closing date associated with some matters that existed as of the closing date, including pending litigation. 
 
 Other 
 Cleco is involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory, environmental, and administrative proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions, arbitrators, and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The liability Cleco may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters may be in excess of amounts currently accrued. Management regularly analyzes current information and, as of December 31, 2022, believes the probable and reasonably estimable liabilities based on the eventual disposition of these matters are million and has accrued this amount. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees 
 Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have entered into various off-balance sheet commitments in the form of guarantees and standby letters of credit, in order to facilitate their activities and the activities of Cleco Holdings subsidiaries and equity investees (affiliates). Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power have also agreed to contractual terms that require the Registrants to 

pay third parties if certain triggering events occur. These contractual terms generally are defined as guarantees. 
 Cleco Holdings entered into these off-balance sheet commitments in order to entice desired counterparties to contract with its affiliates by providing some measure of credit assurance to the counterparty in the event Cleco s affiliates do not fulfill certain contractual obligations. If Cleco Holdings had not provided the off-balance sheet commitments, the desired counterparties may not have contracted with Cleco s affiliates or may have contracted with them at terms less favorable to its affiliates. 
 The off-balance sheet commitments are not recognized on Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Balance Sheets because management has determined that Cleco s and Cleco Power s affiliates are able to perform the obligations under their contracts and that it is not probable that payments by Cleco or Cleco Power will be required. 
 Cleco Holdings provided guarantees and indemnities to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States as a result of the sale of the Perryville generation facility in 2005. The remaining indemnifications relate to environmental matters that may have been present prior to closing. These remaining indemnifications have no time limitations. The maximum amount of the potential payment to Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States is million. Management does not expect to be required to pay Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States under these guarantees. 
 On behalf of Acadia, Cleco Holdings provided guarantees and indemnifications as a result of the sales of Acadia Unit 1 to Cleco Power and Acadia Unit 2 to Entergy Louisiana in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The remaining indemnifications relate to the fundamental organizational structure of Acadia. These remaining indemnifications have no time limitations or maximum potential future payments. Management does not expect to be required to pay Cleco Power or Entergy Louisiana under these guarantees. 
 Cleco Holdings provided indemnifications to Cleco Power as a result of the transfer of Coughlin to Cleco Power in March 2014. Cleco Power also provided indemnifications to Cleco Holdings as a result of the transfer of Coughlin to Cleco Power. The maximum amount of the potential payment to Cleco Power and Cleco Holdings for their respective indemnifications is million, except for indemnifications relating to the fundamental organizational structure of each respective entity, of which the maximum amount is million. Management does not expect to be required to make any payments under these indemnifications. 
 As part of the Amended Lignite Mining Agreement, Cleco Power and SWEPCO, joint owners of the Dolet Hills Power Station, have agreed to pay the loan and lease principal obligations of the lignite miner, DHLC, when due if DHLC does not have sufficient funds or credit to pay. Any amounts projected to be paid would be based on the forecasted loan and lease obligations to be incurred by DHLC, primarily for reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2022, Cleco Power does not expect any payments to be made under this guarantee. Cleco Power has the right to dispute the incurrence of loan and lease obligations through the review of the mining reclamation plan before the incurrence of such obligations. The Amended Lignite Mining Agreement does not affect the amount the Registrants can borrow under their credit facilities. 
 In April 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO mutually agreed not to develop additional mining areas for future lignite extraction and subsequently provided notice to the LPSC of

 Other Commitments 
 Cleco has accrued for liabilities related to third parties, employee medical benefits, and AROs. 
 In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants (CCR Rule). The CCR Rule established extensive requirements for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, 

notification, and internet posting requirements. In August 2018, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated several requirements in the CCR regulation, which included eliminating the previous acceptability of compacted clay material as a liner for impoundments. As a result, in August 2020, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register that would set deadlines for costly modifications including retrofitting of clay-lined impoundments with compliant liners or closure of the impoundments. In November 2020, Cleco submitted demonstrations to the EPA specifying its intended course of action for the ash disposal facilities at Rodemacher Unit 2, Dolet Hills Power Station, and Big Cajun II in order to comply with the final CCR Rule. During 2021, additional information was submitted to the LDEQ to revise and update Cleco Power s compliance strategy. During the third quarter of 2021, management received additional information in connection with Cleco Power s and Cleco Cajun s compliance strategies resulting in a revision to the estimated cash flows expected to be required to settle the respective AROs. Therefore, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun recorded an increase of million and million, respectively, in their ARO balances. On January 11, 2022, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun received communication from the EPA that the demonstrations had been deemed complete. However, the demonstrations are still subject to EPA approval based on pending technical reviews. 
 At December 31, 2022, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun recorded adjustments to their respective AROs due to revised cost estimates. Therefore, Cleco Power recorded an increase of million and Cleco Cajun recorded an increase of million in their respective ARO balances.

 As part of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, NRG Energy agreed to indemnify Cleco for certain environmental costs up to million associated with the CCR Rule. At December 31, 2022, Cleco Cajun had an indemnification asset totaling million. The current portion of the indemnification asset of million is reflected in Other current assets and the non-current portion of million is reflected in Other deferred charges on Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The indemnification asset is expected to be collected as closure costs are incurred. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 Cleco could be subject to possible adverse consequences if Cleco s counterparties fail to perform their obligations or if Cleco or its affiliates are not in compliance with loan agreements or bond indentures. 
 Access to capital markets is a significant source of funding for both short- and long-term capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows.

 Cleco Katrina/Rita 
 During 2008, Cleco Katrina/Rita acquired a million intangible asset which included million for the right to bill and collect storm recovery charges from customers of Cleco Power and million of financing costs.

In 2020, amortization expense of million was recognized in Cleco s and Cleco Power s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 Other Intangibles 
 As a result of the 2016 Merger, fair value adjustments were recorded on Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheet for the valuation of finite intangible assets relating to long-term wholesale power supply agreements. At the end of their lives, these power supply agreement intangible assets will have residual value. The intangible assets related to the power 

and years, and the amortization is included in Electric operations on Cleco s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 As a result of the 2016 Merger, fair value adjustments were recorded on Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheet for the valuation of a finite intangible asset relating to the Cleco Power trade name. In August 2021, a wholesale customer that is currently under contract with Cleco Power through March 31, 2024, informed Cleco Power that it was not selected through its request for proposal process as a provider of load after the first quarter of 2024. Cleco considered this to be a triggering event and determined that the carrying value of the trade name intangible asset may not be recoverable. Therefore, a valuation of the Cleco Power trade name was conducted to test for impairment. A discounted cash flow model utilizing an estimated weighted average cost of capital of was used to determine the fair value of the Cleco Power trade name. As a result, Cleco determined that the fair value of the Cleco Power trade name was less than its carrying value and an impairment of million was recognized reducing the carrying value to at September 30, 2021. 
 As a result of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, fair value adjustments were recorded on Cleco s Consolidated Balance Sheet for the difference between the contract and market price of acquired long-term wholesale power agreements. At the end of their lives, these intangible assets and liabilities will have residual value. These intangibles are amortized over the estimated life of each applicable contract ranging between and years. The amortization is included in Electric operations on Cleco s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 As part of the Cleco Cajun Transaction, Cleco assumed an LTSA for maintenance services related to the Cottonwood Plant.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD A) 
 This section provides information about the compensation program in place for the Company s named executive officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table. It includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of its compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 Compensation Philosophy 
 The compensation principles and philosophy of the Committee are: 
 
 Executives should be rewarded on performance, and incentives should align interests between management and the Company while considering prudent risk taking; 
 Total remuneration (the sum of base salary, annual incentives, long-term incentives, and retirement benefits) is determined so the combination of all pay elements will deliver a total compensation opportunity comparable to that of the Company s Peer Group. 

Newly hired and/or promoted executives should be transitioned to median over time as they become more proficient in their roles; 
 The mix of fixed compensation (base salary and retirement benefits) and variable/at-risk compensation (annual incentive and long-term incentive) should align with market by emphasizing variable/at-risk compensation; and 
 The competitive market for an executive s compensation will be based on comparable utilities and will not be adjusted for Cleco s privately held status or location. 
 
 Compensation Program Elements 
 The Committee targets total compensation (made up of the elements described below) to be competitive with the median of the Comparator Group, but individual positioning may vary above or below the median depending on each executive s experience, performance, and contribution to the Company. For 2022, Cleco believes that it accomplished its philosophy through the following compensation and benefit components: 

2022 PAY ELEMENT DESCRIPTION Base Salary Fixed pay element Delivered in cash Annual Cash Incentive (STIP) Performance-based annual incentive plan that pays out in cash Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric for the named executive officers Additional metrics include safety, system reliability, customer service, generation fleet availability, and milestone measures Long-Term Incentives Performance-based incentive paid in cash currently with a three-year cycle 
 Payout is contingent on Average ROIC and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), each weighted at 50 
 Benefits Broad-based benefits such as group medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage; basic life insurance; supplemental life insurance; dependent life insurance; accidental death and dismemberment insurance; a defined benefit pension plan (for those employees hired prior to August 1, 2007); and a 401(k) Plan with a Company match for those employees hired before August 1, 2007, as well as a 401(k) Plan with an enhanced benefit for those employees hired on or after August 1, 2007 Executive Benefits SERP (closed to new participants in 2014) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Perquisites Limited to executive physicals, spousal/companion travel, and relocation assistance 
 
 Roles and Responsibilities 
 
 Leadership Development and Compensation Committee 
 The Committee, which consists of one independent Board Manager and three investor Board Managers, is responsible for developing and overseeing the Company s executive compensation program. The Committee met seven times during 2022 with primarily virtual attendance. The Chief Human Resources and Diversity Officer attended the Committee meetings on behalf of management but did not participate in all of the Committee s executive sessions. 
 The Committee s responsibilities, which are more fully described in its charter, include: 
 
 establishing and overseeing the Company s executive compensation philosophy and goals and the programs which align with those; 
 engaging and evaluating an independent compensation consultant; 
 determining if the Company s executive compensation and benefit programs are achieving their intended purposes, 

being properly administered and creating proper incentives in light of the Company s risk factors; 
 analyzing the executive compensation and benefits practices of peer companies and annually reporting to the Board or recommending for approval by the Board the overall design of the Company s executive compensation and benefit programs; 
 annually evaluating the performance of the CEO and the CFO and recommending to the Board adjustments in the CEO's and CFO s compensation and benefits; 
 overseeing the administrative committees and periodically reviewing the Company s benefit plans, including retirement plans; 
 annually reviewing the Committee s charter and revising as necessary; 
 annually ensuring there is a process for talent and succession management for executives; and 
 reviewing and making recommendations on efforts to promote diversity and inclusion.

 The Compensation Consultant 
 The Committee engaged Pay Governance to consult on matters concerning executive officers compensation and benefits. All executive compensation adjustments and award calculations for 2022 were reviewed by Pay Governance on behalf of the Committee. Pay Governance acted at the direction of the Committee and was independent of management. Pay Governance was responsible for: 
 
 recommending a group of peer companies to use for its market comparisons; 
 reviewing the Company s executive compensation program, including compensation levels in relation to Company performance, pay opportunities relative to those at comparable companies, short- and long-term incentive targets and metrics, executive retirement benefits, and other executive benefits; 
 reviewing the Company s Board of Manager compensation program; 
 reporting on emerging trends and best practices in the area of executive and Board of Manager compensation; and 
 attending the Committee meetings. 
 
 The Committee reviewed the firm s qualifications as well as its independence and the potential for conflicts of interest. The Committee concluded that Pay Governance is independent, and its services to the Committee do not create any conflicts of interest. The Committee has the sole authority to approve Pay Governance s compensation and determine the nature and scope of its services. Pay Governance does not perform any other services for or receive any other fees from the Company. 
 
 CEO 
 The CEO discusses with the Committee base salary adjustments, cash incentives, and long-term incentive awards 

for executives other than himself. The CEO participates in meetings of the Committee to discuss executive compensation, including measures and performance targets but is subsequently excused to allow the Committee to meet in executive session without management present. 
 
 Evaluation and Design of the Compensation and Benefit Programs 
 The Committee believes that compensation and benefits for executive officers who successfully enhance investors value should be competitive with the compensation and benefits offered by similar companies in the industry to attract and retain the high quality executive talent required by the Company. The Committee examines executive officers compensation against comparable positions using publicly available proxy data for a group of 12 industry peers (Peer Group) and utility industry survey data to help design and benchmark executive officer compensation. This evaluation includes base salary, annual and long-term incentive plan targets, other potential awards, retirement benefits, and target total compensation. The Peer Group is used to track comparable performance of the long-term incentive plan. The combination of the Peer Group and the utility industry survey data is referred to as the Comparator Group. 
 The Peer Group did not change in 2022. The Committee will continue to evaluate the Peer Group annually as companies are often acquired, taken private, or grow at a rate that renders them inappropriate for comparison purposes. The Committee evaluates the Peer Group to ensure that peer companies are of similar scope in relation to revenues, assets, and employee count and have a good operational fit. 

2022 PEER GROUP COMPANIES ALLETE, Inc. Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. Otter Tail Corporation Alliant Energy Corporation IDACORP, Inc. Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Avista Corporation NorthWestern Corporation PNM Resources, Inc. Black Hills Corporation OGE Energy Corp. Portland General Electric Company 
 
 In setting executive compensation levels in 2022, the Committee also used utility industry survey data from the most recent Willis Towers Watson Energy Services Executive Compensation Database. Survey data provides a broader energy industry perspective. This survey data is used in conjunction with the Peer Group data as a competitive market reference point for the Committee to consider in determining pay levels. 
 
 Decisions Made in 2022 with Regard to Each Compensation and Benefit Component 
 
 Base Salary 
 The base salary levels for the executive officers as a group, including the named executive officers are set so that, in combination with other pay elements, it will deliver a total compensation opportunity comparable to that of the Company s Peer Group. The Committee sets the base salary level for the CEO and CFO. 

Base salaries for the named executive officers in 2022 are shown in the table below: 
 
 NAME 2022 BASE SALARY 2022 CHANGE (1)

 median for total remuneration. 
 (2) Cleco Power employee. 
 
 Annual Cash Incentive 
 The Company maintains the STIP, an annual, performance-based cash incentive plan. The STIP applies to all regular, full-time employees, and it includes weighting for corporate and individual performance goals. The STIP award opportunities for executive officers are set so that, in combination with other pay elements, it will deliver a total compensation opportunity comparable to that of the Company s Peer Group. The 

123 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Committee sets the annual cash incentive level for the CEO and CFO. Payouts are capped at 200 of target. 
 The table below presents the target STIP opportunities for the named executive officers in 2022: 
 
 NAME TARGET AS OF BASE SALARY Mr. Fontenot (1) 
 115 Ms. Guillory 65 Mr. LaBorde 50 Mr. Hilton (2) 
 50 Mr. Conway 60 
 (1) Mr. Fontenot has a target STIP of 115 with 100 determined on the same basis as the other officers and the remaining 15 based on the realization of the Milestone Measures. 
 (2) Cleco Power employee. 

The 2022 STIP award for the named executive officers was based on the corporate and individual performance measures described below. This includes measures that apply to non-named executive officers and employees. The 2022 corporate performance measures consisted of the elements listed below based on the business unit (weighting): 

CONSOLIDATED BUSINESS UNIT MILESTONE MEASURES SAFETY ADJUSTED EBITDA EFORd PEAK EAF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION LPSC SAIDI ADJUSTED EBITDA Cleco Power 10 20 10 15 5 20 20 Cleco Support (1) 
 10 45 7.5 7.5 7.5 2.5 20 Cleco Cajun 10 20 5 15 30 20 
 (1) Cleco Support business unit measures are calculated as an average (50 of the Cleco Power weighting and 50 of the Cleco Cajun weighting). 
 
 The Committee included Milestone Measures (Measures) in the 2022 STIP corporate metrics for EMT and other corporate officers weighted at 20 and a stretch objective weighted at an additional 5 . These Measures were associated with progress milestones on key strategic corporate projects related to safety performance improvement, ESG, business plan objectives, Cleco Cajun restructuring resolution, Madison 3 carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), business process improvements utilizing technology, and cybersecurity. For the STIP calculation, the Committee put the greatest emphasis on financial performance using an adjusted EBITDA metric at both the business unit and consolidated levels. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for certain pension and SERP expenses, gains and losses on certain life insurance policies, certain 2016 Merger and Cleco Cajun Transaction related expenses, variable lease revenue, and unrealized gains and losses on FTRs and gas-related contract derivatives. In addition, to continually focus the entire organization on the importance of safety, system reliability, generation fleet availability, sustainability, and to focus Cleco Power and Cleco Support executives and employees on customer satisfaction, the remainder of the STIP opportunity was attributable to these operational measures. 
 Management recommends the STIP financial performance and other measures to the Committee. Based on the historical performance relative to target and the relative historical performance versus the Peer Group, the Committee reviews, revises as appropriate, and approves the STIP measures for the upcoming year. 
 
 Details Related to Corporate Performance Metrics Established to Determine 2022 STIP Award Levels 
 
 Metric # 1 : Safety Consolidated For the 2022 safety measure, the Company included the frequency of incidents represented by the Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), which represents 4 of the overall STIP award, the severity of incidents represented by the Days Away, Restricted or 

Transferred (DART) rate, which represents 4 of the overall STIP award, and Contractor Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), which represents 2 of the overall STIP award. These three measures total 10 for the safety metric. The targets for TRIR and DART safety measures were based on the average rates of the companies in the Southeastern Electric Exchange, of which Cleco is a member, over the three-year period of 2019, 2020, and 2021. The target for Contractor TRIR is based on a 10 year-over-year improvement.

 Metric # 8: Milestone Measures Cleco officers had an additional STIP metric for 2022 . This metric represents 20 of the overall STIP award for the corporate measures for executives and measures progress on certain strategic initiatives. These initiatives included safety performance improvement (5 ), business application strategy and cybersecurity (5 ), business plan objectives (5 ), and Cleco Cajun restructuring resolution (5 ). This measure also includes a stretch objective (5 for ESG and Madison 3 CCS initiatives. For 2022, executives were able to earn up to 5 in addition to the 20 target based on success of milestone measures. The Committee evaluated the performance of each initiative and determined the 2022 result for the Milestone Measures as follows.

 The Committee also has the authority to adjust the amount of any individual STIP award upon recommendation by the CEO. Adjustments for the STIP participants, except for the named executive officers and other members of EMT, may be made by the CEO at his discretion. Adjustments are based on the annual performance review process. 
 
 Long-Term Compensation 
 In 2022, the Committee continued a cash-based LTIP and issued grants for the three-year cycle for the performance period ending December 31, 2022. The metrics for the LTIP cycle issued in 2022 are weighted 50 on the three-year average ROIC and 50 on TSR. 
 Each executive officer s target LTIP award level is set, so in combination with other pay elements, it will deliver a total compensation opportunity comparable to that of the

 2020-2022 LTIP Award 
 The Leadership Development Compensation Committee approved an overall award level of 74 of target for the LTIP three-year performance cycle that ended on December 31, 2022. This award level represents an average ROIC of 74 and TSR of 74 over the three-year performance period. This award will be paid in cash and is included in column G of the Summary Compensation Table for 2022. 
 
 Retirement Plans - Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
 The Company maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan so that members of the Boards, executive officers, and certain key employees may defer receipt and taxation of certain forms of compensation. Members of the Boards may defer up to 100 of their compensation; executive officers and other key employees may defer up to 50 of their base salary and up to 100 of their annual cash incentive. The use of deferred compensation plans is prevalent within the industry and within the companies in the Peer Group. The Company does not match deferrals or contribute to the plan. Actual participation in the plan is voluntary. The notional investment options made available to participants are selected by the CFO. The allocation of deferrals among investment options is made by individual participants. The notional investment options include money market, fixed income, and equity funds. No changes were made to the plan during 2022. 
 
 Retirement Plans - SERP 
 The Company maintains a SERP for the benefit of the executive officers who are designated as participants by the Committee. SERP was designed to attract and retain executive officers who have contributed and will continue to contribute to the Company s overall success by ensuring that adequate compensation will be provided or replaced during retirement. In July 2014, the Cleco Corporation Board of Directors voted to close SERP to new participants. 
 Benefits under SERP vest after ten years of service or upon death or disability while a participant is employed by the Company. The Committee may reduce the vesting period, which typically would occur in association with recruiting efforts. Benefits, whether or not vested, are forfeited in the event a participant is terminated for cause. 
 Generally, benefits are based upon a participant s attained age at the time of separation from service. The maximum benefit is payable at age 65 and is 65 of final compensation. Payments from the Company s defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan), certain employer contributions to the 401(k) Plan and payments paid or payable from prior and subsequent employers defined benefit retirement or similar supplemental plans reduce or offset SERP benefits. If a 

participant has not attained age 55 at the time of separation and receives SERP benefits before attaining age 65, SERP benefits are actuarially reduced to reflect early payment. The Pension Benefits table lists the present value of accumulated SERP benefits for the named executive officers as of December 31, 2022. 
 In 2011, the Committee amended SERP to eliminate the business transaction benefit previously included in SERP, as well as the requirement that a SERP participant be a party to an employment agreement to receive change in control benefits. 
 With regard to current SERP participants, two participants have agreed to fix the base compensation portion of their SERP calculation as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, they have agreed to use target rather than actual awards under the annual incentive plan for years 2016 and 2017 for the average incentive award portion of the SERP calculation. A third participant s SERP benefit will be set at a specified amount based upon the year of separation. 
 In the event a SERP participant s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause, or the participant terminates his or her employment on account of good reason, occurring within the 36-month period following a change in control event for all participants who commenced participation in SERP prior to October 28, 2011, or the 24-month period following a change in control event for all participants who commenced participation in SERP on or after October 28, 2011, such participant s benefit shall: (i) become fully vested; (ii) be increased by adding three years to an affected participant s age, subject to a minimum benefit of 50 of final compensation; and (iii) be subject to a modified reduction determined by increasing the executive s age by three years. 
 
 Change in Employment Status and Change in Control Events 
 During 2022, the Company had no employment agreements with current named executives other than the agreements with Mr. Fontenot as President CEO and Mr. Conway as Chief Corporate Development Compliance Officer General Counsel. T he Company may enter into employment agreements with its executives generally in connection with recruiting efforts. The standard agreement provides for a non-renewing term, generally two years, and does not contain a change in control tax gross-up provision. 
 
 The Cleco Corporation Executive Severance Plan 
 In recognition of the non-renewal of executive employment contracts, the Cleco Corporation Board of Directors adopted the Cleco Corporation Executive Severance Plan (the Executive Severance Plan) on October 28, 2011. The Executive Severance Plan provides the executive officers and other key employees with cash severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment, including involuntary termination in connection with a change in control. 
 
 Perquisites and Other Benefits 
 The Company may make available the following perquisites to its executive officers: 
 
 Executive officer physicals - as a condition of receiving their STIP award, Cleco requires and pays for an annual physical for the executive officers and their spouses; 
 Spousal/companion travel - in connection with the various industry, governmental, civic, and entertainment activities of 

127 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 the executive officers, Cleco pays for spousal/companion travel associated with such events; 
 Relocation program - in addition to the standard relocation policy available to all employees, Cleco maintains a policy whereby the executive officers and other key employees may request that the Company pay real estate agent and certain other closing fees should the officer or key employee sell his/her primary residence or that the Company purchase the executive officer s or key employee s primary residence at the greater of its documented cost (not to exceed 120 of the original purchase price) or average appraised value. Typically, this occurs when an executive officer or key employee relocates at the Company s request; and 
 Purchase program - under the Executive Severance Plan, a covered executive officer may request the Company to purchase his/her primary residence in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause or separates for good reason, either in connection with a change in control and further provided the executive officer relocates more than 100 miles from the residence to be purchased. Limits on the purchase amount are the same as the relocation program described above. 
 
 The Committee approves the perquisites based on what it believes is prevailing market practice, as well as specific Company needs. The Company believes the relocation program is an important element in attracting executive talent. Perquisite expenses related to business and spousal companion travel for the executive officers are reviewed by Internal Audit, and any exceptions are reported to the Audit Committee. 
 See the section titled All Other Compensation for details of these perquisites and their value for the named executive officers. 
 The executive officers, including the named executive officers, participate in the other benefit plans on the same terms as other employees. These plans include paid time off for vacation, sick leave, and bereavement; group medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage (including the annual wellness program); basic life insurance; supplemental life insurance; dependent life insurance; accidental death and dismemberment insurance; defined benefit pension plan (for those hired prior to August 1, 2007); and the 401(k) Plan with a Company match for those employees hired before August 1, 2007, as well as a 401(k) Plan with an enhanced benefit for those employees hired on or after August 1, 2007. 
 
 Board Compensation 
 The Governance and Public Affairs Committee may engage the Committee s independent consultant from time to time to conduct market competitive reviews of the Board compensation program. Details of the Boards compensation are shown in the Board of Manager Compensation table. 
 
 Other Tools and Analyses to Support Compensation Decisions 
 
 Tally Sheets 
 At least annually, the Committee reviews tally sheets that set forth the items listed below. This review is conducted as part of the comparison of the compensation and benefit components that are prevalent within the Comparator Group. The comparison facilitates discussion with the Committee s outside independent consultant as to the use and amount of each 

compensation and benefit component versus the applicable Peer Group. 
 
 Annual compensation expense for each named executive officer - this includes the rate of change in total cash compensation from year-to-year; the annual periodic cost of providing retirement benefits; and the annual cost of providing other benefits such as health insurance, as well as the status of any deferred compensation. 
 Reportable compensation - to further evaluate total compensation; to evaluate total compensation of the CEO compared to the other executive officers; and to otherwise evaluate internal equity among the named officers. 
 Post-employment payments - reviewed pursuant to the potential separation events discussed in Potential Payments at Termination or Change in Control. 
 
 Trends and Regulatory Updates 
 As needed, and generally at least annually, the Committee reviews reports related to industry trends, legislative and regulatory developments, and compliance requirements based on management s analysis and guidance provided by Pay Governance, as applicable. Plan revisions and compensation program design changes are implemented as needed. 
 
 Risk Assessment 
 The Committee also seeks to structure compensation that will provide sufficient incentives for the executive officers to drive results while avoiding unnecessary or excessive risk taking that could harm the long-term value of the Company. The Committee believes that the following actions and/or measures help achieve this goal: 
 
 the Committee reviews the design of the executive compensation program to ensure an appropriate balance between business risk and resulting compensation; 
 the Committee allocates pay mix between base salary and performance-based pay to provide a balance of incentives; 
 the design of the incentive measures is structured to align management s actions with the interests of the investors; 
 incentive payments are dependent on the Company s performance measured against pre-established targets and goals and/or compared to the performance of companies in the Peer Group; 
 the range and sensitivity of potential payouts relative to target performance are reasonable; 
 the Committee imposes checks and balances on the payment of compensation discussed herein; 
 detailed processes establish the Company s financial performance measures under its incentive plans; and 
 incentive targets are designed to be challenging, yet achievable, to mitigate the potential for excessive risk-taking behaviors. 
 
 IRC Section 409A 
 IRC Section 409A generally was effective as of January 1, 2005. The section substantially modified the rules governing the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation. The consequences of a violation of IRC Section 409A, unless corrected, are the immediate taxation of amounts deferred, the imposition of an excise tax and the assessment of interest on the amount of the income inclusion, each of which is imposed upon the recipient of the compensation. The plans, agreements and incentives subject to IRC Section 409A have 

128 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 been operated pursuant to and are in compliance with IRC Section 409A. 
 
 IRC Section 162(m) 
 IRC Section 162(m) limits to 1,000,000 the amount Cleco may deduct in a tax year for compensation paid to covered employees defined as the principal executive officer, principal financial officer (or anyone serving that role in a tax year), the next three highest compensated officers after the CEO and CFO, as well as any covered employees from prior years. 

The Committee took actions considered appropriate to preserve the deductibility of compensation paid to executive officers, but the Committee did not adopt a formal policy that required all compensation to be fully deductible. As a result, the Committee may have paid or awarded compensation that it deemed necessary or appropriate to achieve business goals and to align the interests of executives with those of Cleco s investors, whether or not the compensation was fully deductible under IRC Section 162(m).

 General 
 The Summary Compensation Table sets forth individual compensation information for the CEO, the CFO, and the three other most highly compensated executive officers of Cleco and its affiliates for services rendered in all capacities to Cleco and its affiliates during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (the named executives or named executive officers ). Compensation components represent both payments made to the named executive officers during the year and other forms of compensation as follows: 
 
 Column C, Salary; Column D, Bonus; Column E, Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation; and Column G, All Other Compensation represent cash compensation earned by the named executive in 2022, 2021, or 2020. 
 The amounts shown in Column F, Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings, represent changes in the actuarial value of accrued benefits during 2022, 2021, and 2020 under the Pension Plan and SERP, as applicable. Actuarial value computations are based on assumptions discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Financial Statements Note 10 Pension Plan and 

Employee Benefits. The 2022 changes shown in Column F are due in part to the actuarial impact from a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate future benefits under the Pension Plan and SERP. Negative changes, if any, are reported as zero. This compensation will be payable to the named executive in future years, generally as post-employment retirement payments. 
 
 Salary 
 Data in Column C includes pay for time worked, as well as pay for time not worked, such as vacation, sick leave, jury duty, bereavement, and holidays. The salary level of each of the named executives is determined by a review of market data for companies comparable in size and scope to Cleco, as discussed under Compensation Discussion and Analysis Decisions Made in 2022 with Regard to Each Compensation and Benefit Component Base Salary. In some instances, merit lump sum payments are used to recognize positive performance when base pay has reached or exceeded the Company s base pay policy target, and are included in the salary column. Deferral of 2022, 2021, and 2020 base pay made by Mr. Fontenot and Mr. LaBorde, pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan also is included in the salary 

129 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 column and is further detailed in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table. Adjustments to base pay are recommended to the Committee typically on an annual basis, and if approved, usually are implemented in January. Base salary changes made in 2022 for named executives and the reasons for those changes are discussed in Compensation Discussion and Analysis Decisions Made in 2022 with Regard to Each Compensation and Benefit Component Base Salary. 
 
 Bonus 
 Column D, Bonus includes non-plan-based, discretionary incentives earned during 2022, 2021, or 2020. 
 
 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation 
 Column E, Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation contains cash awards earned during 2022 that will be paid in March 2023 under the STIP; earned during 2021 and paid in March 2022 under the STIP; and earned during 2020 and paid in March 2021 under the STIP. Deferral of annual cash incentive payments made by Mr. Fontenot and Mr. LaBorde pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan also is included in Column E and is further detailed in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table. Column E also includes cash awards earned during 2022 that will be paid in March 2023; earned during 2021 that were paid in March 2022, and earned during 2020 that were paid in February 2021 for the LTIP performance periods ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
 
 Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings 
 The values in Column F represent the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of benefits earned by each named executive officer during 2022, 2021, and 2020 under the Pension Plan and SERP, including SERP s supplemental death benefit provision. These values do not represent cash received by the named executives in 2022, 2021, and 2020; rather, these amounts represent the present value of future retirement payments Cleco projects will be made to each named executive. Changes in the present value of the Pension Plan and SERP benefits from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 

2022; from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021; and from December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2020, result from an additional year of earned service, compensation changes and the increase (or decrease) in value caused by the change in the discount rate used to compute present value. (Generally, a decrease in the discount rate will increase the present value of benefits and an increase in the discount rate will decrease the present value.) If the discount rate increases by a large enough amount, it can cause the accrued pension and SERP liability to decline versus the prior year. When this occurs, the values reported for Column F are zero. 
 The present value of the accumulated benefit obligation for each named executive officer is included in the table, Pension Benefits. These values are reviewed by the Committee in conjunction with its annual tally sheet analysis. An explanation of why the Company uses SERP and its relationship to other compensation elements can be found in Decisions Made in 2022 With Regard to Each Compensation and Benefit Component. 
 Column F also would include any above-market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation paid by the Company. There were no such preferential earnings paid by the Company in 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
 
 All Other Compensation 
 Payments made to or on behalf of named executive officers in Column G, All Other Compensation, include the following: 
 
 Contributions by Cleco under the 401(k) Plan on behalf of the named executive officers; 
 Term life insurance premiums paid for the benefit of the named executive officers; 
 Spousal travel; 
 Certain corporate memberships; and 
 Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax due currently and paid by the Company on the annual increase in the named executive officers future SERP benefits. 
 
 The value of the Column G items for 2022 for each named executive officer is as follows:

 General 
 The target values for each of the Company s incentive plans the STIP and the LTIP are determined as part of the Committee s review of executive officer compensation. The Committee s review, supported by data prepared by Pay Governance, includes comparisons of base salary and annual and long-term incentive levels of Cleco executive officers versus the Comparator Group as detailed in Compensation Discussion and Analysis Evaluation and Design of the Compensation and Benefit Programs. Targets for both the STIP and the LTIP are set as a percentage of base salary and stated in their dollar equivalent in the table above.

 (1) Ms. Guillory is not a participant in SERP as her appointment to her current position was after the plan was closed to new participants. 
 (2) Mr. LaBorde has prior years of service credit under the Pension Plan. He is not currently a participant in the Plan because he was rehired after the Pension Plan was closed to new participants in 2007. 
 (3) Mr. Hilton is not a participant in SERP as his appointment to his current position was after the plan was closed to new participants. 
 (4) Mr. Conway was not a participant in the Pension Plan or SERP as he was hired after both plans were closed to new participants. 
 
 General 
 The Company provides executive officers who meet certain tenure requirements benefits from the Pension Plan and SERP. Vesting in the Pension Plan requires five years of service with the Company. Mr. Fontenot, Ms. Guillory, and Mr. Hilton are fully vested in the Pension Plan. Mr. LaBorde is fully vested in the Pension Plan based on previous service with the Company. Having been rehired after August 1, 2007, he was no longer eligible to participate in the Pension Plan and was included in an enhanced 401(k) Plan for those employees hired (or rehired) on or after August 1, 2007. Mr. Conway, having been hired after August 1, 2007, was not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan and was included in an enhanced 401(k) Plan for those employees hired on or after August 1, 2007. 
 Vesting in SERP requires ten years of service. Under the terms of SERP, automatic vesting occurs upon a Change in Control if a participating executive is involuntarily terminated from the Company. Messrs. Fontenot and LaBorde are all fully vested in SERP based on years of service. Ms. Guillory and Messrs. Hilton and Conway are not participants in SERP. 
 The present value of each of the named executive officer s accumulated benefit values was actuarially calculated and represents the values as of December 31, 2022. These calculations were made using the projected unit credit method for valuation purposes and a discount rate of 5.44 . Other material assumptions relating to the valuation include use of th e Pri-2012 Employee and Healthy Retiree gender distinct mortality tables projected generationally using Scale MP-2020 (using White Collar for SERP present values and no collar for Qualified Plan present values), assumed retirement at age 65 and retirement payments in the form of joint and 100 survivor with 10 years certain payment. 

The sum of the change in actuarial value of the Pension Plan during 2022 and the change in value of SERP is included in Column F, Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings, in the Summary Compensation Table. Negative changes, if any, are reported as zero. 
 
 Pension Plan 
 The Cleco Corporate Holdings LLC Pension Plan, restated effective September 1, 2020, is a defined benefit plan funded entirely by employer contributions. Effective August 1, 2007, the Pension Plan was closed to new participants. Employees hired or rehired on or after August 1, 2007 are eligible to participate in an enhanced 401(k) Plan. Mr. Fontenot, Ms. Guillory, and Mr. Hilton were hired prior to August 1, 2007. 
 Benefits under the Pension Plan are determined by years of service, age at retirement, and highest total average compensation for any consecutive five calendar years during the last ten years of employment. Earnings include base pay, cash incentives, merit lump sums, imputed income with respect to life insurance premiums paid by the Company, pre-tax contributions to the 401(k) Plan, salary and bonus deferrals to the Deferred Compensation Plan, and any other form of payment taxable under IRC Section 3401(a). Earnings exclude reimbursement of expenses, gifts, severance pay, moving expenses, outplacement assistance, relocation allowances, welfare benefits, benefits accrued (other than salary and bonus deferrals) or paid pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan, the value of benefits accrued or paid (including dividends) under the LTIP, income from the exercise of stock options and income from disqualifying stock dispositions. For 2022, the amount of earnings was further limited to 305,000 as prescribed by the IRS. 

131 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 The formula for calculating the defined benefit under the Pension Plan is as follows: 
 
 1. Defined Benefit = Annual Benefit + Supplement Benefit 
 2. Annual Benefit = Final Average Earnings Years of Service Pension Factor 
 3. Supplement Benefit = (Final Average Earnings - Social Security Covered Compensation) Years of Service .0065 
 
 The applicable pension factor for 2022 was 1.25 . Based on the benefit formula, the pension factor will remain at 1.25 in future years . Social Security-covered income is prescribed by the IRS based on the year of birth. 
 Benefits from the Pension Plan are generally paid at normal, late or early retirement dates and are subject to a limit prescribed by the IRS, generally 245,000 in 2022. Normal retirement at age 65 entitles the participant to a full pension. A participant may elect to delay retirement past age 65 as long as he/she is actively employed. Years of service continue to accumulate (up to a maximum of 35) and earnings continue to count toward the final earnings calculation. If a participant chooses to retire after age 55 but before normal retirement age, the amount of the annual pension benefit is reduced by 3 per year between ages 55 and 62. For example, the normal pension benefit at age 55 is reduced by 21 . 
 
 SERP 
 SERP is designed to provide retirement income of 65 of an executive officer s final compensation at normal retirement, age 65. Final compensation under SERP is based on the sum of the highest annual salary paid during the five years prior to termination of employment and the average of the three highest STIP awards paid to the participant during the preceding 60 months. Final compensation also is determined without regard to the IRS limit on compensation. The SERP benefit rate at normal retirement is reduced by 2 per year for each year a participant retires prior to age 65, with a minimum benefit rate of 45 at age 55. The final benefit rate also may be reduced further if a participant separates from service prior to age 55. This actuarially determined reduction factor is equivalent to that used in the Pension Plan, which is 3 for each year from age 55 to 62. For example, if a SERP participant were to terminate service at age 50 and start receiving his or her SERP benefit at age 55, his or her SERP benefit rate would be 35.6 . This is the product of the minimum SERP benefit of 45 reduced by another 21 for early commencement. The actual SERP benefit payments are 

reduced if a participant is to receive benefit payments from the Pension Plan, has received certain employer contributions related to the 401(k) Plan and/or is eligible to receive retirement-type payments from former employers and subsequent employers, if applicable. 
 SERP provides survivor benefits, which are payable to a participant s surviving spouse or other beneficiary. SERP also contains a supplemental death benefit that was added in 1999 to reflect market practice. If a SERP participant dies while actively employed, the amount of the supplemental death benefit is equal to the sum of two times the participant s annual base salary as of the date of death and the participant s target bonus payable under the annual incentive plan for the year in which death occurs. If a participant dies after termination of employment, the supplemental benefit is equal to the sum of the participant s final annual base salary and target bonus payable under the annual incentive plan for the year in which the participant retired or otherwise terminated employment. The supplemental death benefit is not dependent on years of service. 
 In July 2014, Cleco Corporation s Board of Directors closed SERP to new participants. In August 2016, the Company s Board of Managers voted to freeze salary and bonus components used in the final compensation calculation as of December 31, 2017, for Mr. LaBorde. In December 2017, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Fontenot as its CEO, the terms of which amended the calculation of Mr. Fontenot s SERP benefit to include a fixed benefit depending upon the year Mr. Fontenot separates from the Company. With regard to former employees or their beneficiaries, all terms of SERP will continue.

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 Deferred Compensation 
 Named executives and other key employees are eligible to participate in the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants are allowed to defer up to 50 of their base salary and up to 100 of their annual cash incentive, as reported in Columns C and G in the Summary Compensation Table. Consequently, the executive officer contributions listed in Column B above are made by the participant and not by Cleco. Messrs. Fontenot and LaBorde elected to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan during 2022 . All deferral elections for 2022 were made prior to the beginning of 2022 as required by the regulations under IRC Section 409A. There are no matching contributions made by the Company. 
 Deferrals become general funds for use by the Company to be repaid to the participant at a pre-specified date. Short-term deferrals may be paid out as early as five years following the end of the plan year (i.e., the year in which compensation was earned). Retirement deferrals are paid at the later of termination of service or the attainment of an age specified by the participant. A bookkeeping account is maintained for each participant that records deferred salary and/or bonus, as well as earnings on deferred amounts. Earnings are determined by the performance of notional investment alternatives, which are similar to the investments available under the 401(k) Plan. Participants select which of these alternatives will be used to determine the earnings on their own accounts. The Deferred Compensation Plan is not intended to provide for the payment of above-market or preferential earnings (as these terms are defined under the SEC regulations) on compensation deferred under the plan. As such, the Deferred Compensation Plan does not provide a guaranteed rate of return . 
 
 Potential Payments at Termination or Change in Control 
 The following tables, Potential Payments at Termination or Change in Control, detail the estimated value of payments and benefits provided to each named executive officer assuming the following separation events occurred as of December 31, 2022: termination by the executive; disability; death; retirement; constructive termination; termination by the Company for cause; and termination in connection with a change in control. The Company has selected these events based on long-standing provisions in employee benefit plans, such as the Pension Plan and 401(k) Plan, or because the use is common within the industry and Comparator Group. Some of the potential severance payments are governed by the separate documents establishing the STIP, LTIP, and SERP. 
 At its October 2011 meeting, Cleco Corporation s Compensation Committee approved the Executive Severance Plan to provide severance benefits to executive officers. In October and December 2014 and July 2015, the Cleco Corporation s Compensation Committee approved amendments to the Executive Severance Plan. At December 31, 2022, all of the named executive officers were covered by the Executive Severance Plan. 
 The following narrative describes the type and form of payments and benefits for each separation event. The tables under Potential Payments at Termination or Change in Control provide an estimate of potential payments and benefits to each named executive officer under each separation event. Throughout this section, reference to executive officers is inclusive of named executive officers. 

Termination by the Executive 
 If an executive officer resigns voluntarily, no payments are made or benefits provided other than those required by law. 
 
 Disability 
 Annual disability benefits are payable when a total and permanent disability occurs and are paid until the executive officer s normal retirement age, which is age 65. This benefit is provided under SERP, if applicable, and is paid regardless of whether the executive was vested in SERP at the time of disability. At age 65, a disabled executive is eligible to receive annual retirement benefits under the Pension Plan, for those who are participants, and SERP as outlined under the headings Pension Plan and SERP, respectively. The executive officer also is eligible to receive a one-time, prorated share of the current year s STIP award and a prorated award for each LTIP performance cycle in which he/she participates to the extent those performance cycles award at their completion. 
 
 Death 
 A prorated share of the current year s STIP award and a supplemental death benefit provided from SERP, if applicable, are paid to an executive officer s designated beneficiary in the event of death in service. Both are one-time payments. The executive officer s designated beneficiary is also eligible to receive a prorated award for each LTIP performance cycle in which the executive officer participates, to the extent those performance cycles award at their completion. 
 Annual survivor benefits are payable to an executive officer s surviving spouse for his/her life, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the executive officer s designated beneficiary for a period of ten years or, if no designated beneficiary is named, to the executive officer s estate for a period of ten years. Amounts are calculated under the provisions of the Pension Plan and SERP. For more information, see the discussion under the headings Pension Plan and SERP, respectively, as well as SERP provisions relating to death while in service. Survivor benefits are paid from SERP regardless of vested status in SERP at the time of death. The SERP supplemental death benefit is paid only to executives who were employed by the Company on or after December 17, 1999. Messrs. Fontenot and LaBorde are eligible for this benefit. 
 
 Retirement 
 In the event of early or normal retirement, the executive officer is eligible to receive a prorated share of the current year s STIP award and at least a prorated award for each LTIP performance cycle in which he/she participates to the extent those performance cycles award at their completion. Retirement benefits are provided pursuant to the Pension Plan and SERP. Payments are made monthly and are calculated using the assumptions described in the discussion following the Pension Benefits table. 
 
 Constructive Termination 
 Payments made and benefits provided upon a constructive termination are ordinarily greater than payments made on account of an executive officer s retirement, death or disability because separation effectively is initiated by the Company. Certain payments are made contingent upon the execution of a waiver, release and covenants agreement in favor of the Company. Constructive termination also may be initiated by an 

133 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 executive officer if there has been (i) a material reduction in his/her base compensation, other than a reduction uniformly applicable to all executive officers; and (ii) a contemporaneous, material reduction in his/her authority, job duties, or responsibilities. 
 Under the terms of the Executive Severance Plan, an executive would receive constructive termination payments including up to 52 weeks of base compensation, up to 50,000 in lieu of outplacement services and reimbursement of premiums paid to maintain coverage under Cleco s medical plan for up to 18 months. The executive also would be eligible for a prorated portion of the current year s payout under the STIP and a prorated award for the LTIP performance cycles in which he/she participates, to the extent those performance cycles award at their completion. 
 If the executive officer has vested retirement benefits and has attained eligible retirement age, he/she would receive retirement benefits as described under Pension Benefits. 
 
 Termination for Cause 
 Cause is defined as an executive s (i) intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in the course of employment or other intentional misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company s financial condition or business reputation; (ii) intentional damage to Company property, including the wrongful disclosure of its confidential information; (iii) willful and intentional refusal to perform the essential duties of his/her position; (iv) failure to fully cooperate with government or independent agency investigations; (v) conviction of a felony or crime involving moral turpitude; (vi) willful, reckless, or negligent violation of the material provisions of Cleco s Code of Conduct; or (vii) reckless or intentional acts or failures to act in a manner which materially compromises his/her ability to perform the essential duties of his/her position; or (viii) willful, reckless, or negligent violation of rules related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or rules adopted by the SEC. No payments, other than those required by law, are made or benefits provided under the Executive Severance Plan if an executive officer is terminated for cause. If an executive officer is vested in SERP, that benefit is forfeited. The value of that forfeiture is shown as a negative number in the separation payments tables. 
 
 Change in Control 
 The term Change in Control is defined in the LTIP. One or more of the following triggering events constitute a Change in Control: 
 
 Any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or an Affiliate or any person who on the effective date of this Plan is a director, officer, or is the beneficial owner (as determined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20 or more of the combined voting power of outstanding securities of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan (within the meaning of Code Section 4975(e)(7)) sponsored by the Company or an Affiliate, is or becomes the beneficial owner (as determined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 80 or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company; 
 The Company is party to a merger or consolidation with another entity and, as a result of such transaction, 80 or more of the combined voting power of outstanding securities of the Company or its successor in the merger (or a direct or 

indirect parent company of the Company or its successor in the merger) is owned in the aggregate by persons who were not beneficial owners (as determined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company immediately before such transaction; 
 The Company sells, leases, or otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or in a series of related transactions, all or substantially all of its assets; 
 The owners of the Company approve a plan of dissolution or liquidation; or 
 All or substantially all of the assets or the issued and outstanding membership interests of Cleco Power LLC is sold, leased or otherwise disposed of in one or a series of related transactions to a person, other than the Company or an Affiliate. 
 
 Except as described below, payments are made and benefits provided only if an executive s employment is terminated during the 60-day period preceding or the 24-month period following the Change in Control. 
 Termination must be involuntary and by the Company without cause or initiated by the executive on account of Good Reason. Good reason means that (i) a Participant s base compensation in effect immediately before the commencement of a Change in Control Period is materially reduced, or there is a material reduction or termination of such Participant s rights to any employee benefit in effect immediately prior to such period; (ii) a Participant s authority, duties or responsibilities are materially reduced from those in effect immediately before the commencement of a Change in Control Period, or such Participant has reasonably determined that, as a result of a change in circumstances that materially affects his or her employment with the Company, he or she is unable to exercise the authority, power, duties and responsibilities assigned to him or her immediately before the commencement of such period; or (iii) a Participant is required to transfer to an office or business location that is more than 60 miles from the primary location to which he or she was assigned prior to the commencement of a Change in Control Period. No event or condition shall constitute Good Reason hereunder unless (a) a Participant provides to the Committee written notice of his or her objection to such event not later than 60 days after such Participant first learns, or should have learned, of such event; (b) such event is not corrected by the Company promptly after receipt of such notice, but in no event more than 30 days after receipt thereof; and (c) such Participant Separates from Service not more than 15 days following the expiration of the 30-day period described in clause (b) hereof. The executive also must satisfy the conditions included in the waiver, release and covenants agreement defined in the Executive Severance Plan. 
 Under the Executive Severance Plan, an executive would receive an amount up to two times the sum of annualized base salary and the average non-equity incentive plan bonus over the last three fiscal years and reimbursement of COBRA premiums for up to 24 months. Payments may also include the purchase of the executive officer s primary residence and reimbursement of relocation expenses, but only if the executive relocates his/her primary residence more than 100 miles. No excise tax payments or gross-ups are made; instead, benefits will be reduced in lieu of the imposition of the tax. The numbers shown below do not give effect to this reduction. 
 Subject to the conditions described above, upon a Change in Control, SERP benefits are: (i) fully vested; 

134 

CLECO CLECO POWER 2022 FORM 10-K 

 (ii) increased by adding three years to an affected executive s age, subject to a minimum benefit of 50 of compensation; and (iii) subject to a modified actuarial reduction determined by increasing the executive s age by three years. 
 If an executive officer is vested and of eligible retirement age, he or she may become eligible to begin to receive the annual retirement benefit described above upon a Change in Control . 
 The following tables set forth the value of post-employment payments and benefits that are not generally made available to all employees. Each separation event is assumed to occur on December 31, 2022. Retirement is assumed to occur at age 55 or the named executive officer s actual attained age if greater than 55. Estimated payments 

under the STIP and LTIP for disability, death, retirement and constructive termination are uncertain until the completion of the performance period/cycle. In the case of the STIP, the performance period is the current fiscal year. The estimated payment for the home purchase and relocation is a projection of the expense to the Company to sell the named executive officer s principal residence including any loss avoided by the named executive officer by having the right to sell the residence to the Company, plus the projected cost to the Company to relocate the named executive officer. 
 Pursuant to Item 401(j) of Regulation S-K, the separation events disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are assumed to occur in the past, as of December 31, 2022.

 A non-management Board Manager may elect to participate in the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan and defer the receipt of all or part of his or her fees. Benefits are equal to the amount credited to each Board Manager s individual account based on compensation deferred plus applicable investment returns as specified by the director upon election to participate in the plan. Investment options are similar to those provided to participants in the 401(k) Plan. Funds may be reallocated between investments at the discretion of the Board Manager. Accounts, which may be designated separately by deferral year, are payable in the form of a single-sum payment or in the form of substantially equal annual installments, not to exceed 15, when a Board Manager ceases to serve on the Cleco s Boards or attains a specified age. 
 
 Fees Earned or Paid in Cash 
 During 2022, each Board Manager who is not a Cleco employee or appointed by the Owner Group, except Ms. Stark, 

received an annual cash retainer of 160,000. Ms. Stark received an annual cash retainer of 3,750. During this period, the non-management Chair was compensated with an additional retainer of 90,000. 
 Board Managers are permitted to defer receipt of their fees under the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan. Messrs. Gallot and Gilchrist elected to defer all or a portion of their fees in 2022. 
 Cleco reimburses Board Managers for travel and related expenses incurred for attending meetings of Cleco s Boards and Board committees, including travel costs for spouses/companions. No expenses for spouses/companions were incurred during 2022. 
 Cleco also provides its Board Managers who are not employed by Cleco or appointed by the Owner Group with 200,000 of life insurance and permanent total disability coverage under a group accidental death and dismemberment plan maintained by Cleco Power. The total 2022 premium for all coverage (exempt employees, officers and Board Managers) under this plan wa s 6,128.

 REPORT OF THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Boards (see Boards of Managers of Cleco above and Director Independence and Related Party Transactions below), includes four managers, one of whom meets the additional requirements for independence which were adopted by the Board. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee operates under a written charter last revised in December 2021, a co py of which is posted on

 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee was established in April 2016. 
 Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee recommended to the Company s Boards that the CD A and related required compensation disclosure tables be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and filed with the SEC.

 Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 The members of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee are set forth above. No members of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee were officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during 2022, were former Company officers, or had any relationship otherwise requiring disclosure. 
 
 CEO Pay Ratio 
 The aggregate compensatio n of the executive who served in the CEO role in 2022 (Mr. Fontenot) was 2,651,721. This 

amount differs from the aggregate amount reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because of the inclusion of the value of the Company s contribution to health and welfare benefits. The median employee s annual total compensation for 2022 was 113,124, calculated including the same components of total pay as was used for Mr. Fontenot. As a result, Cleco estimates that the CEO s 2022 annual total compensation was 23.4 times that of the median employee s annual total compensation. The median employee was determined based on employees of the Company on December 31, 2022, using the consistentl y applied compensation measure of target total cash compensation (including base salary and target bonus). Target total cash compensation was annualized for those employees that were not employed for the full year of 2022. 
 The pay ratio estimate has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. In addition, because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

Security Ownership of Directors and Management and Certain Beneficial Owners 
 Following the closing of the 2016 Merger, there are no longer any outstanding shares of Cleco Corporation common stock. 

Equity Compensation Plan Information 
 Cleco has no compensation plans under which equity securities are awarded. 

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Director Independence and Related Party Transactions 
 Cleco s Boards have adopted categorical standards to assist them in making determinations of managers independence. These categorical standards are posted on Cleco s web site at https://cleco.com/about/leadership-governance/governance-guidelines. A copy of the standards is also available free of charge by request sent to: Public Relations, Cleco, P.O. Box 5000, Pineville, LA 71361-5000. The Boards have determined that Rick Gallot (member of the Boards of Cleco Group, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power), Randy Gilchrist (member of the Boards of Cleco Group, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power), Peggy Scott (member of the Boards of Cleco Group, Cleco Holdings, and Cleco Power), Melissa Stark (member of the Board of Cleco Power), and Bruce Wainer (member of the Boards of Cleco Group, Cleco Holdings and Cleco Power) are independent within the meaning of the categorical standards adopted by the Boards. 
 Cleco has no relationships to report under Item 407(a)(3).

 Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
 The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The policy 

requires the general pre-approval of annual audit services and specific pre-approval of all other permitted services. In determining whether to pre-approve permitted services, the Audit Committee considers whether such services are consistent with SEC rules and regulations. Furthermore, requests for pre-approval for services that are eligible for general pre-approval must be detailed as to the services to be provided. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pr e-approval and the fees for the services performed to date. During 2022 and 2021, all audit and non-audit fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the policy described above and pursuant to applicable rules of the SEC. 
 For the fiscal years ended De cember 31, 2022, and 2021, professional services provided for Cleco Power that were directly billed to Cleco Holdings were allocated to Cleco Power though not billed directly to Cleco Power.
