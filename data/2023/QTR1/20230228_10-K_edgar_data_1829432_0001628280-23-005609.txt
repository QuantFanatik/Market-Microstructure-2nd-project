The Units sold in the Initial Public Offering were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of 1.0 billion, and incurring offering costs of approximately 55.9 million, of which 35.0 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one of the Company s Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant.

Of the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, 1.0 billion was placed in a Trust Account. Each whole Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 
 
 Beginning March 25, 2021, holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the Units.

 amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023 to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as its board of directors may determine in its sole discretion (the Extension ).

 Extension Promissory Note 
 
 On January 26, 2023, our Sponsor agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Trust Account of 0.03 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of 1.2 million per month (each deposit, a Contribution following the approval and implementation of the Extension.

The Maturity Date may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. Any outstanding principal under the Extension Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time by us, at our election and without penalty. 
 
 Business Acquisition Criteria 
 
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, further accelerate the growth of a company in the public markets. 
 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination, including X-energy. We will leverage these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but to the extent our proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and we search for other acquisition opportunities, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe have the following core attributes: 
 
 a differentiated and sustainable business model with a defensible market position; 
 
 strong people, processes and culture; 
 
 attractive growth prospects, including an ability to capitalize on positive secular tailwinds; 
 
 a strong customer base; 
 
 sufficient scale and resources to achieve a successful transition into the public market; 
 
 will benefit from having a public currency to enhance its ability to grow organically or through M and 
 
 will benefit from Ares relationships and deep value creation capabilities. 
 
 We may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry. 
 
 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. As a result of changes in the market since our Initial Public Offering, we may consider a target business in the fossil fuel industry, including the upstream, midstream and energy services sub-sectors. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our directors and executive officers may deem relevant. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating opportunities such as our proposed Business Combination with X-energy, in the event that we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination with X-energy and decide to enter into our initial business combination with another target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination. These communications would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.

 Our Acquisition Process 
 
 The Ares investment process leverages the power of the Ares platform and an extensive network of professionals across investment areas to identify and source attractive risk adjusted return opportunities while emphasizing capital preservation. Ares utilizes its collective market and company knowledge, proprietary internal industry and company research, third party information and financial modeling to drive fundamental analysis and investment selection. Ares also recognizes the importance of considering environmental, social and governance ESG factors in its investment process and has adopted an ESG policy for the conduct of its business. Ares works collaboratively with its various underwriting, asset management, legal and compliance teams to appropriately integrate relevant ESG considerations into its investment process. 
 
 At the center of Ares investment process is a systematic approach that emphasizes rigorous due diligence at the company and market level in addition to a risk-adjusted return value assessment. This investment process is comprised of five stages: (i) generate a robust pipeline, (ii) perform initial screening, (iii) conduct due diligence, (iv) drive transaction structuring, funding and overall execution, and (v) use a systematic approach to value creation. We will benefit from the same approach as we pursue our initial business combination. 
 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. 
 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor, or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor, or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm. 
 
 Our directors and executive officers may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
 Initial Business Combination 
 
 The rules of the NYSE require that we must consummate our initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, or if we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. We also will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. Subject to these limitations, our directors and executive officers will have virtually unlimited flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of X-energy was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds in the Trust Account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 
 
 If we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, we may also pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with Ares, one or more parties affiliated with Ares, including without limitation, officers and affiliates of Ares, or Ares funds, or investors in such Ares funds. Any such party may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such parties a class of equity or debt securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such joint acquisition or specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. 
 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons. We will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (collectively, the Investment Company Act ). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on the relative valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired will be valued for purposes of the NYSE s 80 of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the NYSE s 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. 
 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that is financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our directors and executive officers will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will fully ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 
 If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, will not be currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 
 Other Considerations 
 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Ares or any of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor or any of our executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 
 Ares manages multiple investment vehicles, and expects to raise additional funds or accounts in the future, including during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. These Ares investment entities are expected to be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financings. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity. 
 
 In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers currently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, Ares and the Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies. These funds may have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts may arise with respect to Ares decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Ares, the Ares funds or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to Ares or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Ares, a current or future Ares fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, will first be directed to Ares, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. However, we do not expect these fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. Accordingly, none of Ares or our directors or officers will have obligations to present a business combination opportunity to us. 
 
 Our directors and officers or Ares or its affiliates, including the Ares funds, may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates and the director and officer teams. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 
 In addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our officers and directors are and in the future will be required to commit time and attention to Ares and current and future Ares funds. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, any of such entities (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such entities), Ares and its affiliated funds will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. 
 
 Status as a Public Company 
 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer X-energy, and if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, any other target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their ordinary shares in the target business for Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 
 Furthermore, once the proposed Business Combination is completed, X-energy or if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, any other target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe such business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 
 Financial Position 
 
 With a Trust Account in the amount of approximately 1,013.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and approximately 446.4 million as of February 21, 2023, after taking into account redemptions in connection with the Extension, the expenses of the Initial Public Offering and 35.0 million of deferred underwriting commissions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 
 General 
 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our proposed Business Combination with X-energy using the sources discussed under Proposed Business Combination. If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we intend to effectuate another initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. For more information on the financing arrangements related to the Business Combination, please see the description of the Business Combination Agreement and the Commitment Letter under Proposed Business Combination of this item. 
 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 
 Our process of identifying acquisition targets leverages Ares Management s and our directors and executive officers industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of Ares and our directors and executive officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities. 
 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants and private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. 
 
 We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, including one of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering or one of their respective affiliates, or other individuals, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In addition, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering may provide these services without additional compensation. We will formally engage a finder only to the extent our directors and executive officers determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our directors and executive officers determine is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We pay our Sponsor a total of 16,667 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support and our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing the initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of a target business. 
 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 
 Certain of our directors and executive officers currently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, Ares Management and the Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies. These funds may have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts may arise with respect to Ares Management s decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Ares Management, the Ares funds or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to Ares Management or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Ares Management, a current or future Ares fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, will first be directed to Ares Management, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. None of Ares Management or any of our directors and executive officers who are also employed by Ares Management or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware in their capacities as employees of Ares Management, its funds or their portfolio companies. However, we do not expect these duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. 
 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to our directors and executive officers, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. 
 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 
 subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
 
 cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
 
 Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team 
 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of X-energy, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our directors and executive officers, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of our directors and executive officers will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including our proposed Business Combination with X-energy, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our directors and executive officers will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 
 If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote in connection with another initial business combination, pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
 
 Under the NYSE listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 
 we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
 
 any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the rules) has a 5 or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1 or more (or 5 or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or 
 
 the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
 
 The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; 
 
 the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; 
 
 the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 
 
 other time and budget constraints of the company; and 
 
 additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders. 
 
 Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 
 We expect to seek shareholder approval of our proposed Business Combination with X-energy. In the event that the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and we conduct redemptions in connection with another initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 
 In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to have their shares redeemed. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to have their shares redeemed for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.

 Amendments to Facilitate the Consummation of an Initial Business Combination 
 
 On February 2, 2023, we held a special meeting of shareholders and approved two proposals to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that will facilitate the consummation of the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination. The first amendment extended the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023 to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. The second amendment (the Redemption Limitation Amendment eliminated from the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association a limitation that we shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares to the extent that such redemption would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (the Redemption Limitation ). The Redemption Limitation Amendment enables us to redeem public shares irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the limitation. 
 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then- outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be approximately 10.00 per public share (plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly elect to redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself before we can validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares and any public shares in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules. 
 
 If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 
 conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
 
 file proxy materials with the SEC. 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above. 
 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting. In such case, our Sponsor has agreed to vote its Class B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our Sponsor s Class B ordinary shares, we would need 10,998,541 or 15.3 (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or zero or 0 (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 46,997,081 Class A ordinary shares that remain outstanding following the Extension to be voted in favor of an initial business combination to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to have their public shares redeemed irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Class B ordinary shares and public shares in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 
 conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
 
 file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
 
 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as Excess Shares . We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our directors and executive officers to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our directors and executive officers at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 
 However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 
 Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, are required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System (the DWAC System ), at the holder s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself before we can validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately 80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. To perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder s election to require us to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion.

 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we must complete our initial business combination, including the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 
 
 Our Sponsor, directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Class B ordinary shares if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. However, if our Sponsor, directors or executive officers acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. 
 
 Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to require us to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. 
 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded out of the approximately 38,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account (as of December 31, 2022) plus up to 100,000 of funds from the Trust Account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 
 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be 10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than 10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 
 Although we will seek to have all material vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us

 waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our directors and executive officers will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if our directors and executive officers believe that such third party s engagement would be in the best interest of the company given the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our directors and executive officers to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where our directors and executive officers are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The representatives will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. To protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.00 per share. 
 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all material vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately 38,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account (as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such shareholder.

Table of Contents 

 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who elect to have their Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval, in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder s requiring us to redeem its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 
 
 Competition 
 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. See Other Considerations. 
 
 Facilities 
 
 Our executive offices are located at 245 Park Avenue, 44th Floor, New York, NY 10167. The cost for our use of this space is included in the 16,667 per month fee we pay to our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
 
 Employees 
 
 We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

 Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 
 Our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), or international financial reporting standards IFRS ), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States PCAOB ). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential target business will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential target businesses, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to have our internal control procedures audited. X-energy is not and any other target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 
 Prior to the date of this annual report, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any of our directors and executive officers in their capacity as such. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties related to the proposed Business Combination with X-energy included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including the risks factors relating to X-energy s business, compliance with law, government regulation and litigation, X-energy s capital resources and New X-energy s organizational structure before making an investment decision. If any of the risks and uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition and operations results could be adversely affected in material respects. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

Table of Contents 

 Summary of Risk Factors 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: 
 
 we are an early stage company with no revenues or basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective; 
 
 past performance by Ares or its affiliates or our directors and executive officers, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders; 
 
 our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination; 
 
 your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek shareholder approval of such business combination; 
 
 if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, directors and executive officers have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote; 
 
 the ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights for shares that they hold for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets and may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target; 
 
 the ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a significant portion of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure; 
 
 the ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a significant portion of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination is unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation for your shares to be redeemed; 
 
 we may not be able to consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate; 
 
 if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants from public shareholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants; 
 
 if a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed; 
 
 you will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss; 
 
 the NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions; 
 
 you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies; 
 
 if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15 of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to require us to redeem all such shares in excess of 15 of our Class A ordinary shares; 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless; 
 
 our independent registered public accounting firm s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses a going concern about our ability to continue as a going concern for liquidity and we will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion; 
 
 we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the Trust Account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 
 
 we may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, such as X-energy, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 
 
 holders of Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on any election of directors we hold prior to our initial business combination; 
 
 our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results and thus may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities; 
 
 because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited; 
 
 provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench our directors; 
 
 after our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate; and 
 
 the other risks and uncertainties discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. 
 
 Risk Factors 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and the Initial Business Combination 
 
 Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination. 
 
 We may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. 
 
 Please see the section entitled Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination for additional information. 
 
 Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to require us to redeem your shares for cash, unless we seek shareholder approval of such business combination. 
 
 At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination. 
 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, directors and executive officers have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. 
 
 Our Sponsor, directors and executive officers have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any Class B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Our Sponsor and our directors and executive officers also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting, including the Class B ordinary shares. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders Class B ordinary shares, we would need 10,998,541 or 15.3 (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or zero or 0 (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 46,997,081 Class A ordinary shares that remain outstanding following the Extension to be voted in favor of an initial business combination to have our initial business combination approved. We expect that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 34.7 of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of any such shareholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers (and their respective permitted transferees) to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination. 
 
 The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights for shares that they hold for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets and may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. 
 
 We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If public holders of a substantial portion of our shares were to exercise their redemption rights, we may not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of this risk and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. 
 
 The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a significant portion of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. 
 
 At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expect, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the Trust Account or arrange for additional third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 higher than desirable levels. These considerations may limit our ability to complete the most attractive business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. 
 
 The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a significant portion of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination is unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation for your shares to be redeemed. 
 
 If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account until we liquidate the Trust Account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the Trust Account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with the redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. 
 
 The requirement that we consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. 
 
 Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, including the proposed Business Combination with X-energy. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not consummate an initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. 
 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the proposed Business Combination or complete an alternative initial business combination by August 4, 2023, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem the Class A ordinary shares and liquidate the Trust Account, and our public shareholders would only receive approximately 10.00 per share and the public warrants would expire worthless. 
 
 We cannot assure you that the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination will be consummated prior to August 4, 2023, the date by which we are required to complete our initial business combination or be forced to liquidate, or that an extension request will enable us to complete the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination. Our ability to consummate any business combination depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Although we are required to offer shareholders redemption rights in connection with any shareholder vote to approve a business combination, or if we seek an extension, there may be no extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders to vote upon the proposed Business Combination, another initial business combination or an extension before August 4, 2023. Even if the proposed Business Combination or an extension is approved by our shareholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with a shareholder vote upon an extension and vote upon the Business Combination could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our public shareholders may be unable to recover their investment, except through sales of their public shares on the open market. The price of our securities may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that our public shareholders will be able to dispose of their public shares at favorable prices, or at all. 
 If we are not able to complete the Business Combination with X-energy, complete an alternative business combination or obtain an extension by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten

 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company (less tax payable and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of any remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such case, the public shareholders would only receive approximately 10.00 per share and the public warrants would expire worthless. 
 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants from public shareholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants. 
 
 In connection with the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, our initial shareholders, Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. 
 
 If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. 
 
 In the event that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See Permitted Purchases of Our Securities for a description of how our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction. 
 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 
 If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with the proposed Business Combination with X-energy or a business combination with another target, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 
 
 We will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to require us to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights.

Table of Contents 

 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of an aggregate of 15 of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our Initial Public Offering, you will lose the ability to require us to redeem all such shares in excess of an aggregate of 15 of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our Initial Public Offering. 
 
 In connection with the proposed Business Combination with X-energy or if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and if we seek shareholder approval of a business combination with another target and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with such initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to require us to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15 and, to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 
 
 Our ability to consummate a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the status of debt and equity markets. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global commercial activity and supply chain operations and has contributed to significant volatility in the equity and debt markets. The business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Many countries, including the United States and states and municipalities in which we may operate, have issued (and may re-issue) orders requiring the closure of, or certain restrictions on the operation of, certain businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and may continue to cause, business shutdowns or the re-introduction of business shutdowns, cancellations of events and restrictions on travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. While many of the initial restrictions have been lifted, the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks remains and restrictions have been or may continue to be reimposed to mitigate risks to public health both in the United States and globally. Moreover, even where restrictions are and remain lifted, certain groups of people may continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time, potentially further delaying global economic recovery. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. We are continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and related risks, including risks related to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 (including new variants) and efforts to mitigate the spread and deployment of vaccines. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including COVID-19 variants, remain uncertain and the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on our ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events. 
 
 Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 If we succeed in effecting the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, there will likely be significant competition from X-energy s competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to the proposed Business Combination, we 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. In the event that the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to require us to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these limitations and obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 If the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient for us to operate until August 4, 2023, it could limit the amount available to fund our business and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor or directors and executive officers to fund our business and to complete our initial business combination. 
 
 Of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, only 1,500,000 will be available to us initially outside the Trust Account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account, together with funds available from loans from our Sponsor, will be sufficient for us to operate until August 4, 2023; however, our operating and transaction expenses may exceed this amount. 
 
 If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our Sponsor, directors and executive officers or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our Sponsor, directors or executive officers nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of 1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated 10.00 per share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. 
 
 Even if we conduct due diligence on a target business with which we combine, including X-energy, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. These shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 
 
 If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.00 per share. 
 
 Our placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us, including any regulatory actions successfully made against the Trust Account. Although, following our Initial Public Offering, we will seek to have all material vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our directors and executive officers will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company and will only enter into an agreement with such third party that has not executed a waiver if our directors and executive officers believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. The underwriters will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. 
 
 A third party may refuse to execute a waiver in numerous circumstances, such as the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our directors and executive officers to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where our directors and executive officers are unable to retain a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not consummated an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the 10.00 per public share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 
 However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 
 The grant of registration rights to our Sponsor may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 Pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in the Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor and its permitted transferees can demand that we register the Class A ordinary shares into which Class B ordinary shares are convertible, the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 of the Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loan (described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K) and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the Class B ordinary shares and the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares that is expected when the securities owned by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees are registered. 
 
 Because we are not limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector and have not selected any specific target businesses to pursue in our initial business combination, you will not have the opportunity to assess the merits or risks of any particular target business s operations. 
 
 In the event that the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we may focus our search for a target business in North America, Europe or Asia. We may pursue business combination opportunities in any industry, sector or location, except that we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. If we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in those businesses. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to fully assess all of the risks or have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and we may be unable to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our initial business combination could suffer a decline in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value of their securities. 
 
 We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our directors and executive officers area of expertise. 
 
 We may consider a business combination outside of our directors and executive officers area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our directors and executive officers will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in the Initial Public Offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our directors and executive officers expertise, our directors and executive officers expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this annual report regarding the areas of our directors and executive officers expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our directors and executive officers may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholder who choose to remain shareholders following our business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. 
 
 Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. 
 
 Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. As a result of changes in the market since our Initial Public Offering, we may consider a target business in the fossil fuel industry, including the upstream, midstream and energy services sub-sectors. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. 
 
 Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 
 
 We may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained therein. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. 
 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 300,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, 30,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value 0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2022 there were 200,000,000 and 5,000,000 authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, if any. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination as described herein and in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As of December 31, 2022, there were no preference shares issued and outstanding. 
 
 Due to additional ordinary share issuances, if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is consummated, our shareholders will experience dilution. If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete another proposed initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares to redeem the warrants as described in Description of Securities Warrants Company Public Shareholders Warrants or upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth herein. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides, among other things, that prior to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares: 
 
 may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the Initial Public Offering; 
 may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 
 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants; and 
 may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.

 Unlike most other similarly structured blank check companies, our Sponsor will receive additional Class A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination. 
 
 The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering, plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor upon conversion of the Working Capital Loan. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one to one. This is different than most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20 of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination. 
 
 Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially and adversely affect subsequent attempts to identify and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially and adversely affect subsequent attempts to identify and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 Our assessment of the management of a target business may be limited, and we may be unable to retain that management following a business combination. 
 
 When evaluating a prospective target business, our assessment of the target business s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Should the target business s management not possess the skills or qualifications necessary to manage a public company or the acquired business, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. 
 
 Although we would expect to retain some or all members of a target business s management team following our initial business combination, members of the management of a target business may elect to depart. This could negatively affect the operations and profitability of the post-combination business. As a result of any of the foregoing, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a decline in the value of their shares. 
 
 Ares may choose not to refer certain opportunities to us due to reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations relevant to Ares, its clients and their respective portfolio companies. 
 
 Ares, together with its affiliates, engages in a broad range of business activities and invests in a broad range of businesses and assets. Ares takes into account interests of its affiliates, funds and each of their respective portfolio companies (including reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations that arise from time to time) when determining whether to pursue (or how to structure) a potential transaction or investment opportunity. As a result, it is possible that Ares may choose not to refer a business opportunity to us or our officers or directors who are affiliated with Ares may choose not to pursue an opportunity notwithstanding that such opportunity would be attractive to us due to the reputational, financial, confidentiality, legal, regulatory, tax and/or other interests or considerations of Ares and its affiliates.

 We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that are affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, which may raise potential conflicts of interest. 
 
 In light of the involvement of our Sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under Conflicts of Interest. Our Sponsor, directors and executive officers, Ares, or its affiliates may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Although we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination, any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination and may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not specifically focus on, or target, a transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 
 
 Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering), and conflicts of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. 
 
 On June 5, 2020, our Sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain of our offering costs in consideration of Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001. Prior to the initial investment in the company of 25,000 by the Sponsor, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. As a result of various transactions, our Sponsor (together with its permitted transferees) currently holds an aggregate of 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, which represents 20 of the outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. In addition, our Sponsor has purchased an aggregate of 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, including 1,733,333 additional Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, at a price of 1.50 per warrant, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. If we do not consummate an initial business by August 4, 2023,or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence them in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and operating the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the Initial Public Offering nears, which is the deadline for our consummation of an initial business combination. 
 
 To complete a business combination, we may issue notes or other debt securities or otherwise incur substantial debt, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and negatively impact the value of our shares. 
 
 Although we have no commitments as of the date of this annual report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following the Initial Public Offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the Trust Account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the Trust Account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including: 
 
 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 
 our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
 our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; 
 using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 
 increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or prevailing interest rates; and 
 limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
 
 We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, which will cause us to be dependent on a single business that may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability. 
 
 The net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of warrants provided us with up to 967.1 million that we may use to complete our initial business combination (after taking into account the 35,000,000 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the Trust Account and the expenses of the Initial Public Offering). 
 
 We may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. The lack of diversification that may result from completing our initial business combination with a single entity may subject us to numerous economic, competitive, geographic and regulatory factors. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities that may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may: 
 solely depend on the performance of a single business, property or asset; or 
 depend on the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
 Any of the foregoing risks could have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate following our initial business combination. 
 
 We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. 
 
 If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination timely or at all. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations. 
 
 We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable or attractive as the limited information may have indicated. 
 39 

Table of Contents 

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company such as X-energy. By definition, very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable or attractive as the limited information may have indicated. 
 
 Our directors and executive officers may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 
 
 We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, our directors and executive officers may be unable to maintain control of the acquired business. 
 
 We may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results. 
 
 We may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our directors and executive officers will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to fully assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and we may be unable to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization. 
 
 To effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We may seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support. 
 
 To effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, changed industry focus and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement requires a vote of holders of at least 50 of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, 50 of the number of the then-outstanding Private Placement Warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to have their public shares redeemed for cash if we propose 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We may seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination to effectuate our initial business combination. 
 
 The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account) may be amended with the approval of a special resolution which requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting of the company, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support. 
 
 Some blank check companies have a provision in their charters that prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those relating to a company s pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the company s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by between 90 and 100 of the company s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants into the Trust Account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting of the company, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65 of our ordinary shares; provided that the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our shareholder meeting which shall include the affirmative vote of a simple majority of our Class B ordinary shares. Our Sponsor and its permitted transferees, if any, who collectively beneficially own, on an as-converted basis, 20 of our ordinary shares upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 
 
 Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to have their Class A ordinary shares redeemed upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.

 If the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants prove to be insufficient for our initial business combination, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not completed our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. 
 
 Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. 
 
 The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 
 
 Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition. 
 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this annual report. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 
 If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 
 
 If we pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 If we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following: 
 
 costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations; 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 rules and regulations regarding currency redemption; 
 complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; 
 laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected; 
 exchange listing or delisting requirements; 
 tariffs and trade barriers; 
 regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 
 local or regional economic policies and market conditions; 
 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 
 challenges in managing and staffing international operations; 
 longer payment cycles; 
 tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; 
 currency fluctuations and exchange controls; 
 rates of inflation; 
 challenges in collecting accounts receivable; 
 cultural and language differences; 
 employment regulations; 
 underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems; 
 corruption; 
 protection of intellectual property; 
 social unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances; 
 regime changes and political upheaval; 
 terrorist attacks and wars; and 
 deterioration of political relations with the United States. 
 
 We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 After our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate. 
 
 The economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and pandemics, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable. 
 
 A new 1 U.S. federal excise tax is expected to be imposed on us in connection with redemptions of New X-energy Class A 
 Common Stock. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of certain repurchases (including certain redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations (and certain non-U.S. corporations treated as surrogate foreign corporations ). The excise tax will 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 apply to stock repurchases occurring in 2023 and beyond. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares of stock repurchased at the time of the repurchase. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax; however, only limited guidance has been issued to date. 
 
 The 1 excise tax is not expected to apply to redemptions of Class A ordinary shares to the extent such redemptions occur prior to the Domestication (absent any regulations and other additional guidance that may be issued in the future with retroactive effect). However, absent any additional guidance, if we domesticate and continue as a Delaware corporation prior to the redemptions, and because our securities are trading on the NYSE, we currently expect that New X-energy will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any redemptions of its New X-energy Class A Common Stock in connection with the Business Combination that are treated as repurchases for this purpose if the Business Combination closes on a date after December 31, 2022. Furthermore, we currently expect that New X-energy will generally be subject to the excise tax with respect to any other future redemptions of its New X-energy Class A Common Stock after December 31, 2022 (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of New X-energy). In all cases, the extent of the excise tax that may be incurred would depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of the New X-energy Class A Common Stock redeemed, the extent such redemptions could be treated as dividends and not repurchases, and the content of any regulations and other additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that may be issued and applicable to the redemptions. Issuances of stock by a repurchasing corporation in a year in which such corporation repurchases stock may reduce the amount of excise tax imposed with respect to such repurchase. It is not clear to what extent such reduction would be available with respect to redemptions of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and the issuance of New X-energy Class B Common Stock and New X-energy Class C Common Stock. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to New X-energy (or the cash contribution to X-energy following the Closing in connection with the Business Combination). 
 
 Exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished. 
 
 In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction. 
 
 We may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, which may include acting as financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred commissions that will released from the trust only on a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. 
 
 We may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, including, for example, identifying potential targets, providing financial advisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing. We may pay such underwriter or its affiliate fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that time in an arm s length negotiation. The underwriters are also entitled to receive deferred commissions that are conditioned on the completion of an initial business combination. The underwriters or their respective affiliates financial interests tied to the consummation of a business combination transaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in providing any such additional services to us, including potential conflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. 
 
 Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. 
 
 In recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed in ways adverse to us and our management team. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. These trends may continue into the future. 
 
 The increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors. 
 
 In addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims run-off insurance ). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial 
 doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of 9.6 million. Further, we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our business combination plans. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern.

 Operations Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity, and Capital Resources for additional information. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Proposed Business Combination with X-energy 
 
 The proposed Business Combination with X-energy may not be completed on the anticipated terms and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the proposed Business Combination with X-energy. 
 
 On December 5, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with X-energy, pursuant to which the combined company will be organized in an umbrella partnership C corporation structure, in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined company will be held by X-energy. The combined company s business will continue to operate through X-energy and its subsidiaries. In connection with the Closing, the Company will change its name to X-Energy, Inc. 
 
 The Closing may not be completed on the anticipated terms and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the proposed Business Combination. Even if the Business Combination Agreement is approved by the shareholders of the Company, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived before the parties to the Business Combination Agreement are obligated to complete the Business Combination. The Company does not control the satisfaction of all of such conditions. The Company and X-energy may not satisfy all of the closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreement. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, and such delay may cause the Company and X-energy to each lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Business Combination. 
 
 Subsequent to the Closing, New X-energy may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and its share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. 
 
 Although the Company has conducted due diligence on X-energy, it cannot assure you that this diligence has identified all material issues that may be present within X-energy, that it is possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of X-energy s and outside of the Company s or New X-energy s control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, New X-energy may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in it reporting losses. Even if due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the Company s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on New X-energy s liquidity, the fact that New X-energy reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about New X-energy or its securities. Accordingly, any of the Company s public shareholders who choose to remain stockholders of New X-energy following the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation relating to the Business Combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 
 
 Some of our executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest that may influence or have influenced them to support or approve the Business Combination without regard to your interests or in determining whether X-energy is an appropriate target for our initial business combination. 
 
 Our Sponsor and independent directors currently hold an aggregate of 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, which represents 20 of the outstanding shares after our Initial Public Offering. The Sponsor holds 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, at a price of 1.50 per warrant. Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, our Sponsor has agreed to forfeit up to 73.1 of its Class B ordinary shares and Private Placement Warrants in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, with 50 of the Purchaser Support Parties retained shares (subject to the terms of the Sponsor Support Agreement and following the automatic conversion of each issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share, on a one-for-one basis, into a Class A ordinary share) and the Purchaser Support Parties retained warrants (subject to the terms of the Sponsor Support Agreement) vesting in equal installments at share price thresholds of 12.50 and 15.00 following the proposed Business Combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The personal and financial interests of our Sponsor, executive officers and directors may influence or have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting a target for our initial business combination, their support for completing the proposed Business Combination and the operation of New X-energy following the proposed Business Combination . 
 
 Our Sponsor, its directors and executive officers, and their respective affiliates have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with performing due diligence on suitable targets for business combinations and the negotiation of the proposed Business Combination. At the Closing, our Sponsor, its directors and officers, and their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable targets for business combinations. If a business combination is not completed by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our Sponsor, directors and officers, and any of their respective affiliates will not be eligible for any such reimbursement. 
 
 On February 2, 2023, we extended the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023, to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. In connection with the Extension, on January 26, 2023, our Sponsor agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Trust Account of 0.03 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of 1.2 million per month following the approval and implementation of the Extension. Such Contributions will be made pursuant to the Extension Promissory Note issued by us to our Sponsor. In the event that the proposed Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay this loan, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay this loan. 
 
 Certain officers and members of our board of directors also participate in arrangements that may provide them with other interests in the proposed Business Combination that are different from yours, including, among others, arrangements for their continued service as directors of New X-energy. 
 
 Further, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed: (i) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of the proposed Business Combination; and (ii) not to redeem any shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination. 
 
 These interests, among others, may influence or have influenced our Sponsor and the executive officers and members of our board of directors to support or approve the proposed Business Combination.

 An active, liquid trading market for New X-energy s securities may not develop, which may limit your ability to sell such securities. 
 
 Although we intend to apply to list the New X-energy Class A Common Stock and New X-energy Warrants on the NYSE under the ticker symbols XE and XEW , respectively, an active trading market for such securities may never develop or be sustained following the Closing. The initial valuation of 10.00 per share may not be indicative of the market price of New X-energy Class A Common Stock that will prevail in the open market after the Closing. A public trading market having the desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers at any given time, such existence being dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over which neither we nor any market maker has control. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop and continue would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and New X-energy Warrants. The market price of New X-energy Class A Common Stock may decline below 10.00 per share, and you may not be able to sell your New X-energy Class A Common Stock at or above 10.00 per share, or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by issuing New X-energy Class A Common Stock and New X-energy Warrants. 
 
 During the pendency of the proposed Business Combination, the Company will not be able to enter into a business combination with another party because of restrictions in the Business Combination Agreement. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement will discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement. 
 
 Covenants in the Business Combination Agreement impede the ability of the Company to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Business Combination. As a result, the Company may be at a disadvantage to its competitors during that period. While the Business Combination Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor X-energy may solicit, assist, initiate, engage or facilitate the making, submission or announcement of or encourage, any alternative acquisition proposal, such as a merger, material sale of assets or equity interests or other business combination, with any third party, even though any such alternative acquisition could be more favorable to the Company s shareholders than the Business Combination. If the Business Combination is not completed, these provisions will make it more difficult to complete an alternative business combination following the termination of the Business Combination Agreement due to the passage of time during which these provisions have remained in effect. 
 
 The exercise of the Company s directors and executive officers discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the Business Combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the Business Combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the Company s shareholders best interests. 
 
 In the period leading up to the Closing, events may occur that, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, would require the Company to consider agreeing to amend the Business Combination Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by X-energy or to waiving rights to which the Company is entitled under the Business Combination Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of X-energy s businesses or a request by X-energy to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Business Combination Agreement. In any of such circumstances, it would be at the Company s discretion, acting through board of directors of the Company and the Special Committee, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of the directors described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such director(s) between what such director may believe is best for the Company and its shareholders and what such director may believe is best for themselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action. The Company does not believe there will be any changes or waivers that the Company s directors and executive officers would be likely to make after shareholder approval of the Business Combination Proposal has been obtained. 
 
 The Domestication may result in adverse tax consequences for holders of the Company s Class A ordinary shares and warrants, including holders exercising their redemption rights with respect to the Company Class A ordinary shares if the Domestication were to occur prior to such redemptions. 
 
 The Company intends for the Domestication to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, i.e., an F Reorganization. If the Domestication fails to qualify as an F Reorganization, a U.S. Holder (as defined in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) of the Company s Class A ordinary shares or warrants generally would recognize gain or loss with respect to our Class A ordinary shares or warrants in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the corresponding common stock or warrants of New X-energy received in the Domestication and the U.S. Holder s 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 adjusted tax basis in our Company Class A ordinary shares or warrants surrendered. If the Domestication were to occur prior to the redemption of U.S. Holders that exercise redemption rights with respect to the Company s Class A ordinary shares, U.S. Holders exercising such redemption rights will be subject to the potential tax consequences of the Domestication. Additionally, Non-U.S. Holders (as defined in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) may become subject to withholding tax on any amounts treated as dividends paid on New X-energy Class A Common Stock after the Domestication. 
 
 Assuming that the Domestication qualifies as an F Reorganization, subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, U.S. Holders generally will be subject to Section 367(b) of the Code in connection with the Domestication, and, as a result: 
 
 a U.S. Holder who is a 10 U.S. Shareholder on the date of the Domestication generally will be required to include in income as a deemed dividend deemed paid by the Company the all earnings and profits amount (as defined in the Treasury Regulations under Section 367 of the Code) attributable to the Company s Class A ordinary shares held directly by such U.S. Holder; 
 
 a U.S. Holder whose Class A ordinary shares have a fair market value of 50,000 or more on the date of the Domestication and who, on the date of the Domestication, is not a 10 U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain (but not loss) with respect to our Company Class A ordinary shares as if such U.S. Holder exchanged our Company Class A ordinary shares for New X-energy Class A Common Stock in a taxable transaction, unless such U.S. Holder elects in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations to include in income as a deemed dividend deemed paid by the Company the all earnings and profits amount (as defined in the Treasury Regulations under Section 367 of the Code) attributable to such U.S. Holder s Class A ordinary shares; and 
 
 a U.S. Holder whose Class A ordinary shares have a fair market value of less than 50,000 on the date of the Domestication and who, on the date of the Domestication, is not a 10 U.S. Shareholder, generally will not recognize any gain or loss or include any part of the Company s earnings and profits in income under Section 367 of the Code in connection with the Domestication. 
 
 Additionally, even if the Domestication qualifies as an F Reorganization, proposed Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1291(f) of the Code and certain other PFIC rules (which have retroactive effective dates) generally require that a U.S. person who disposes of stock of a PFIC (including for this purpose, under a proposed Treasury Regulation that generally treats an option to acquire the stock of a PFIC as stock of the PFIC, exchanging warrants for newly issued New X-energy Warrants in the Domestication) must recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of such PFIC stock over its adjusted tax basis, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code. the Company believes that it is likely classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, these proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current form, would generally require a U.S. Holder of Class A ordinary shares to recognize gain under the PFIC rules on the exchange of Class A ordinary shares for New X-energy Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Domestication unless such U.S. Holder has made certain tax elections with respect to such U.S. Holder s Class A ordinary shares. The proposed Treasury Regulations provide coordinating rules with other sections of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), including Section 367(b), which affect the manner in which the rules under such other sections apply to transfers of PFIC stock. These proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current form, would also apply to a U.S. Holder who exchanges warrants for newly issued New X-energy Warrants; under current law, however, the elections mentioned above do not apply to warrants. Any gain recognized from the application of the PFIC rules described above would be taxable income with no corresponding receipt of cash. The tax on any such gain would be imposed at the rate applicable to ordinary income and an interest charge would apply based on complex rules designed to offset the tax deferral to such U.S. Holder on the undistributed earnings, if any, of the Company. It is not possible to determine at this time whether, in what form, and with what effective date, final Treasury Regulations under Section 1291(f) of the Code may be adopted or how any such Treasury Regulations would apply. 
 
 Upon the Closing, the rights of holders of the New X-energy Common Stock arising under the DGCL will differ from and may be less favorable to the rights of holders of Company Ordinary Shares arising under the Companies Act. 
 
 Upon the Closing, the rights of holders of the New X-energy Class A Common Stock, the New X-energy Class B Common Stock, the New X-energy Class C Common Stock and the New X-energy Class D Common Stock (collectively, the New X-energy Common Stock will arise under the Delaware General Corporation Law DGCL ). The DGCL contains provisions that differ in some respects from those in the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the Companies Act ), and, therefore, some rights of holders of New X-energy Common Stock could differ from the rights that holders of Company Ordinary Shares currently possess. For instance, while class actions are generally not available to shareholders under Cayman Islands law, such actions are generally available under Delaware law. This change could increase the likelihood that New X-energy becomes involved in costly litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on New X-energy.

Table of Contents 

 Delaware law and the proposed certificate of incorporation and proposed bylaws of New X-energy will contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable. 
 
 The proposed certificate of incorporation and proposed bylaws of New X-energy that will be in effect at the Closing differ from our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Among other differences, the proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy, and the DGCL, contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by the New X-energy Board and therefore depress the trading price of the New X-energy Class A Common Stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the then-current members of the New X-energy Board or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, the proposed certificate of incorporation and proposed bylaws of New X-energy include provisions regarding: 
 
 the ability of the New X-energy Board to issue shares of preferred stock, including blank check preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 
 
 the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, New X-energy s directors and officers; 
 
 the right of the New X-energy Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the New X-energy board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the New X-energy Board; 
 
 the requirement that directors may only be removed from the New X-energy Board for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the total voting power of then outstanding New X-energy Common Stock; 
 
 a prohibition from and after the time New X-energy ceases to be a controlled company under applicable NYSE rules, on stockholder action by written consent (except for actions by the holders of New X-energy Class B Common Stock, New X-energy Class C Common Stock or as required for holders of future series of preferred stock), which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 
 
 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the New X-energy Board, the chairman of the New X-energy Board or New X-energy s chief executive officer or (ii) for so long as New X-energy is a controlled company under applicable NYSE rules, by the secretary of New X-energy at the request of any holder of record of at least 25 of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of New X-energy, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 
 
 controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of the New X-energy Board and stockholder meetings; 
 
 the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3 of the total voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend, alter, change or repeal certain provisions in the proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the New X-energy Board and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; 
 
 the ability of the New X-energy Board to amend the proposed bylaws of New X-energy, which may allow the New X-energy Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the proposed bylaws of New X-energy to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and 
 
 advance notice procedures with which stockholders of New X-energy must comply to nominate candidates to the New X-energy Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the New X-energy Board and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of New X-energy.

 These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the New X-energy Board or management. 
 
 As a Delaware corporation, New X-energy will generally be subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. 
 
 The proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings between New X-energy and its stockholders, and the federal district courts as the exclusive forum for Securities Act claims, which could limit New X-energy s stockholders ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with New X-energy or its directors, officers, or employees. 
 
 The proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will provide that, unless New X-energy consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and any State of Delaware appellate court therefrom, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of New X-energy; (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by director, officer, other employee or stockholder of New X-energy to it or its stockholders; (iii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against New X-energy, claim against New X-energy governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware. The proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will also provide that, unless New X-energy consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This provision in the proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will not address or apply to claims that arise under the Exchange Act; however, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. To the extent these provisions could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions in connection with such claims, and stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations under the federal securities laws. 
 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of the securities of New X-energy will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of the proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy described in the preceding paragraph. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with New X-energy or its directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against New X-energy and its directors, officers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar exclusive-forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in the proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy is inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find these exclusive-forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, New X-energy may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm its results of operations. 
 
 New X-energy will be a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and, as a result, will qualify for, and intends to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. 
 
 The X-energy Founder will own more than 50 of the combined voting power for the election of directors to the New X-energy Board, and, as a result, New X-energy will be considered a controlled company for the purposes of the NYSE rules. As such, New X-energy will qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including that a majority of the New X-energy Board consist of independent directors, as defined under the NYSE rules. New X-energy will not be required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee or compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities or to conduct annual performance evaluations of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. 
 
 As permitted for a controlled company, a majority of the New X-energy Board and New X-energy s Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees will not be independent. Accordingly, New X-energy stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE rules. 
 
 If at any time New X-energy ceases to be a controlled company under the NYSE rules, the New X-energy Board intends to take any action that may be necessary to comply with the NYSE rules, subject to a permitted phase-in period.

 These and any other actions necessary to achieve compliance with such rules may increase New X-energy s legal and administrative costs, will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place additional strain on New X-energy s personnel, systems and resources. 
 
 The proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will not limit the ability of the Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds 
 associated with the Sponsor or our non-employee directors to compete with us. 
 
 The Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor and our non-employee directors and their respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in similar business activities or lines of business in which the Company now engages or proposes to engage. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor and our non-employee directors and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with New X-energy s interests or those of its stockholders. The proposed certificate of incorporation of New X-energy will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor, our non-employee directors or any of their respective affiliates (including any non-employee director who serves an officer of New X-energy in such person s director and officer capacities) will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which New X-energy engages or proposes to engage or otherwise competing with New X-energy, its stockholders, or any of its affiliates. Further, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event that the Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor and our non-employee directors and their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself and New X-energy or any of its affiliates, they will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or other business opportunity to New X-energy or any of its affiliates and will not be liable to New X-energy or its stockholders or to any of its affiliates for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of New X-energy solely by reason of the fact that they pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves, offer or direct such corporate opportunity to another person, or does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to New X-energy or any of its affiliates. The Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor and their respective directors and officers may pursue, in their capacities other than as directors of the New X-energy Board, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to New X-energy s business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to New X-energy. The Sponsor, certain affiliates or funds associated with the Sponsor and their respective directors and officers may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. 
 
 The Company s executive officers and directors and their affiliates may enter into agreements concerning the Company s securities prior to the extraordinary general meeting, which may have the effect of increasing the likelihood of completion of the Business Combination or decreasing the value of the Company securities. 
 
 At any time prior to the extraordinary general meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material non-public information regarding the Company or its securities, the Company s executive officers and directors and their affiliates may enter into a written plan to purchase the Company s securities pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and may engage in other public market purchases, as well as private purchases, of securities. Further, at any time prior to the extraordinary general meeting, during a period when they are not then aware of any material non-public information regarding the Company or its securities, the Company s executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates may: (i) purchase shares from institutional and other holders who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the proposal to approve the Business Combination or the other shareholder proposals in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or who elect to redeem or indicate an intention to redeem public shares; (ii) execute agreements to purchase such shares from such holders in the future; and (iii) enter into transactions with such holders to provide such holders with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of the proposal to approve the Business Combination or the other shareholder proposals in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or not redeem their public shares. Such an agreement may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of Company Ordinary Shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that the Company s executive officers and directors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from the Company public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their public shares. While the exact nature of any such incentives has not been determined as of the record date, they might include, without limitation, arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their public shares, including the granting of put options and the transfer of shares or Private Placement Warrants owned by the Sponsor for nominal value to such investors or holders.

 The purpose of such share purchases and other transactions by the Company s executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates would be to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirements that the holders of the requisite number of Company Ordinary Shares present and voting at the extraordinary general meeting vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Business Combination and the other shareholder proposals in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. 
 
 Any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the Company Ordinary Shares. For example, as a result of these arrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to sell the shares it owns, either prior to or immediately after the extraordinary general meeting. 
 
 Beginning in January 2022, there has been a precipitous drop in the market values of growth-oriented companies. The market values of growth-oriented and early stage companies, including X-energy, may be more volatile than other securities and may involve special risks. 
 
 Beginning in January 2022, there has been a precipitous drop in the market values of growth-oriented companies like ours. In recent months, inflationary pressures, increases in interest rates and other adverse economic and market forces have contributed to these drops in market value. As a result, the public shares are subject to potential downward pressures, which may result in high redemptions of the cash available from the Trust Account. If there are substantial redemptions, there will be a lower float of New X-energy Class A Common Stock outstanding, which may cause further volatility in the price of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and adversely impact New X-energy s ability to secure financing following the closing of the Business Combination. 
 
 The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS or other regulatory agencies may modify, delay or prevent our Business Combination. 
 
 The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS has authority to review direct or indirect foreign investments in U.S. companies. Among other things, CFIUS is empowered to require certain foreign investors to make mandatory filings, to charge filing fees related to such filings and to self-initiate national security reviews of foreign direct and indirect investments in U.S. companies if the parties to that investment choose not to file voluntarily. In the case that CFIUS determines an investment to be a threat to national security, CFIUS has the power to unwind or place restrictions on the investment. Whether CFIUS has jurisdiction to review an acquisition or investment transaction depends on, among other factors, the nature and structure of the transaction, including the level of beneficial ownership interest and the nature of any information or governance rights involved. For example, investments that result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person always are subject to CFIUS jurisdiction. CFIUS s expanded jurisdiction under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 and implementing regulations that became effective on February 13, 2020 further includes investments that do not result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person but afford certain foreign investors certain information or governance rights in a U.S. business that has a nexus to critical technologies, critical infrastructure and/or sensitive personal data. 
 
 Because the proposed Business Combination contemplates interim financing where non-U.S. persons may become investors in X-energy, the Business Combination may be subject to CFIUS review or other regulatory review, which depends in large part on the ultimate share ownership of the Company following the Business Combination, among other factors. If the Business Combination were to fall within CFIUS s jurisdiction, we risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the transaction. CFIUS may decide to modify or delay our Business Combination, impose conditions with respect to such Business Combination, request the President of the United States to order us to divest all or a portion of X-energy if we were to acquire it without first obtaining CFIUS approval or prohibit the Business Combination entirely. The time necessary for CFIUS review of the transaction or a decision to delay or prohibit the transaction may also prevent the Business Combination from occurring within the applicable time period required under the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. These risks may limit the attractiveness of, delay or prevent us from pursuing our initial Business Combination. 
 
 Moreover, the process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy, and we have limited time to complete our Business Combination. If we are unable to consummate our Business Combination within the applicable time period required under the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will be required to wind up, redeem and liquidate. In such event, our shareholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from an investment in a target company and the appreciation in value of such investment through a Business Combination. Additionally, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up.

 If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted and, as a result, we may fail to satisfy a condition in the Business Combination Agreement and be required to wind up, redeem and liquidate. 
 
 On March 30, 2022, the SEC issued a rule proposal relating to, among other things, circumstances in which special purpose acquisition companies (the SPAC Rule Proposal could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act. The SPAC Rule Proposal includes a proposed safe harbor for such companies from the definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act if a special purpose acquisition company satisfies certain criteria, including a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC transaction. Specifically, to comply with the proposed safe harbor, the SPAC Rule Proposal would require a company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for an initial business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its initial public offering (the IPO Registration Statement ). To avail itself of the safe harbor in the SPAC Rule Proposal, a company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than 24 months after the effective date of its IPO Registration Statement. 
 
 There is currently uncertainty concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to a SPAC. We completed our Initial Public Offering in February 2021 and have operated as a blank check company searching for a target business with which to consummate an initial business combination since such time until our announcement regarding our proposed Business Combination on December 6, 2022. It is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company. 
 
 If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. We do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. In addition, unless we were to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may fail to satisfy a condition in the Business Combination Agreement, which could result in the termination of the Business Combination Agreement. After any such termination, we may be required to wind up, redeem and liquidate. 
 
 To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, instruct the trustee to sell the securities held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash until the earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following sale of securities in the Trust Account, if any, we would likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. 
 
 The funds in the Trust Account have, since our Initial Public Offering, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, including prior to August 4, 2023, instruct the trustee with respect to the Trust Account to sell the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter, to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash until the earlier of consummation of the Business Combination or liquidation of the Company. Following any such sale of the securities held in the Trust Account, we would likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, any decision to sell the securities held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash would reduce the dollar amount the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. In addition, even prior to August 4, 2023, we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the Trust Account are held in short-term U.S. government treasury obligations or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the 24-month anniversary, the greater the risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate the Company. The risk of being deemed subject to the Investment Company Act may increase the longer the Company holds securities (i.e., the longer past two years the securities are held), and also may increase to the extent the funds in the Trust Account are not held in cash. Accordingly, we may determine, in our discretion, to sell the securities held in the Trust Account at any time, even prior to August 4, 2023, and 
 53

 instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash, which would further reduce the dollar amount the public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Management Team 
 
 We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. 
 
 Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, who are employed by an affiliate of our Sponsor, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our officers and directors including, our chief executive officer, David B. Kaplan are and in the future will be required to commit time and attention to Ares and current and future Ares funds. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, any of such entities (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such entities), Ares and its affiliated funds will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. 
 
 In addition, if any of our executive officers ceased to be employed by an affiliate of our Sponsor, such individual may also no longer serve as one of our executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. 
 
 Our ability to effectuate our initial business combination and to successfully operate thereafter will depend on our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 
 
 Our ability to effectuate our initial business combination depends on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of our key personnel. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our current key personnel and to recruit additional qualified personnel. If any of our key personnel join competitors or from competing companies, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. We do not carry any key person insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key personnel. 
 
 We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add key personnel to complete our initial business combination or operate our post-combination business. However, the market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or we may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. 
 
 Our failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could adversely affect our business and reputation. 
 
 Following the completion of the Initial Public Offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we will seek to identify and combine with one or more businesses. Certain of our officers and directors have, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which they are or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. For example, certain of our officers and directors are also officers, managers or directors of Ares and certain of its affiliated funds and investment vehicles, and certain of their current or former portfolio companies. Some of these entities have limited partners or public equityholders to whom these individuals owe fiduciary duties. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may arise in determining the allocation of specific investment opportunities among Ares, its funds and investment vehicles, and us and the allocation of fees and costs among these entities. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. 
 
 In addition, our directors and officers or Ares or its affiliates may in the future become affiliated with other blank check companies that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may arise in determining the allocation of specific investment opportunities to any such companies and us and the allocation of fees and costs among these entities. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 such other blank check companies prior to its presentation to us, subject to our officers and directors fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. 
 
 Though we believe we and Ares have appropriate means and oversight to resolve the foregoing conflicts, our judgment on any particular decision could be challenged. If we fail to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us. 
 
 Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses, which could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 
 Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full professional time to our affairs, which may result in conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our operations and identifying a potential acquisition target and their other professional responsibilities. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he or she may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as, and may in the future serve as, officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 
 Certain of our officers and directors have or will have direct and indirect economic interests in us and/or our Sponsor after the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and such interests may potentially conflict with those of our public shareholders as we evaluate and decide whether to recommend a potential business combination to our public shareholders. 
 
 Certain of our officers and directors may own membership interests in our Sponsor and indirect interests in our Class B ordinary shares and Private Placement Warrants which may result in interests that differ from the economic interests of the investors in the Initial Public Offering, which includes making a determination of whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. There may be a potential conflict of interest between our officers and directors that hold membership interests in our Sponsor and our public shareholders that may not be resolved in favor of our public shareholders. 
 
 Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. 
 
 We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Although it is not our intention, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, or one or more of our directors or executive officers or in which they have a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. 
 
 The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence them in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders best interest. This could give rise to claim by us or our shareholders for a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law. However, we may not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them. 
 
 Compliance with United States securities laws may require additional time and resources. 
 
 Following our initial business combination, our directors and executive officers may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination may 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with United States securities laws, compliance with which may place a strain on our systems and resources. If our directors and executive officers are not able to develop the necessary expertise, procedures and processes, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely or accurate basis, which could subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the Commission or violations of applicable NYSE listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer if our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could have a material adverse effect on us and lead to a decline in the price of our securities. 
 
 Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities 
 
 You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. 
 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provisions relating to rights of our shareholders right or pre-business combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Public shareholders who elect to have their Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the Trust Account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the Trust Account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. 
 
 The NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
 
 We have been approved to have our units listed on the NYSE and to have our Class A ordinary shares and warrants on or promptly after their date of separation. Although after giving effect to the Initial Public Offering we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the NYSE listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be, listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. To continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum market capitalization (generally 50,000,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). 
 
 Additionally, our units will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination and, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE continued listing requirements, to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. 
 
 For instance, for our shares to be listed upon the consummation of our business combination, at such time our share price would generally be required to be at least 4.00 per share, our total market capitalization would be required to be at least 200.0 million, the aggregate market value of publicly held shares would be required to be at least 100.0 million and we would be required to have at least 400 round lot shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those listing requirements at that time. 
 
 If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 reduced liquidity for our securities; 
 a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 
 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
 The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because we have been approved to have our Class A ordinary shares and warrants listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 
 
 Our investors are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies. 
 
 We are a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, since we had net tangible assets in excess of 5,000,001 upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC on February 10, 2021, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors are not afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete our initial business combination within 18 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. Because we are not subject to rule 419, our Units are immediately tradable, we will be entitled to withdraw amounts from the funds held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial business combination and we may have a longer period of time to complete such a business combination than we would if we were subject to such rule. 
 
 Anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares and other securities may result in additional dilution to holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 Our Sponsor acquired the Class B ordinary shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to the dilution of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the Class B ordinary shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 The terms of the warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then-outstanding public warrants. 
 
 Our warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then-outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50 of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, 50 of the number of the then-outstanding Private Placement Warrants. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50 of the then-outstanding public warrants to effect any 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 change thereto, including to increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. 
 
 Our warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company. 
 
 Our warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an enforcement action ), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. 
 
 This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. 
 
 We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. 
 
 We have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption, and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. Except as otherwise set forth herein, none of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 
 
 In addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of 0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, provided that (i) the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and (ii) certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A ordinary shares. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (a) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (b) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants. 
 
 None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us as so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 
 
 Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. 
 
 We issued warrants to purchase 20,000,000 of our Class A ordinary shares as part of the units offered in the Initial Public Offering, and we issued in a private placement 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if our Sponsor makes any working capital loan, it may convert up to 1,500,000 of such loan into up to an additional 1,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at the price of 1.50 per warrant. 
 
 Because each unit contains one-fifth of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. 
 
 Each unit contains one-fifth of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other similar offerings whose units include one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one fifth of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share. 
 
 A provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. 
 
 Unlike most blank check companies, if (i) we issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per ordinary share, (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger prices will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 10.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. 
 
 Our Sponsor controls a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. 
 
 Our Sponsor (together with its permitted transferees) owns, on an as-converted basis, 34.7 of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, it may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. If our Sponsor purchases any additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase its control. Neither our Sponsor nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this annual report. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our Sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a terms for three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual shareholder meeting to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual shareholder meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our Sponsor, will control the outcome. In addition, prior to the 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, our Sponsor will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination. 
 
 Because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited. 
 
 We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers. 
 
 Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We are also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States. 
 
 We have been advised by Maples and Calder, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 
 
 As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by our directors and executive officers, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company. 
 
 Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench our directors. 
 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions will include a staggered board of directors, the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only holders of our Class B ordinary shares, which have been issued to our Sponsor, are entitled to vote on the election of directors, which may make more difficult the removal of our directors and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 
 
 Since only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the election of directors, upon the listing of our shares on the NYSE, the NYSE may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.

 Only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the election of directors. As a result, the NYSE may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: 
 
 we have a board of directors that includes a majority of independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE; 
 
 we have a compensation committee of our board of directors that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and 
 
 we have a nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities. 
 
 We do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. 
 
 Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders. 
 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below 10.00 per share. 
 
 We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers. 
 
 We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and to not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the Trust Account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
 
 If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages. 
 
 If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 creditors or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. 
 
 If, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us and is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 
 
 If, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us and is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 
 
 If we have not consummated an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such date before redemption from our Trust Account. 
 
 If we have not consummated an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, the proceeds then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the Trust Account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind-up, liquidate the Trust Account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond August 4, 2023 before the redemption proceeds of our Trust Account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our Trust Account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to require us to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we have not completed our initial business combination and have not amended certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association by August 4, 2023. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 
 
 Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. 
 
 If we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it were proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors or as having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offense and may be liable for a fine of 18,293 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands. 
 
 We may not hold an annual shareholder meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 
 In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual shareholder meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold shareholder meetings to elect directors. Until we hold an annual shareholder meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to elect directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual shareholder meeting) serving a three-year term. 
 
 Holders of Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on any election of directors we hold prior to our initial business combination. 
 
 Prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the election of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. 
 
 We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless. 
 
 We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our Private Placement Warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the warrants included as part of units sold in the Initial Public Offering. In such an instance, our Sponsor and its transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
 
 Our ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis after we call the warrants for redemption or if there is no effective registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants will cause holders to receive fewer Class A ordinary shares upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to pay the exercise price of their warrants in cash. 
 
 If we call the warrants for redemption, we will have the option, in our sole discretion, to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. If we choose to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis or if holders elect to do so when there is no effective registration statement, the number of Class A ordinary shares received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his or her warrant for cash. For example, if the holder is exercising 875 public warrants at 11.50 per share through a cashless exercise when the Class A ordinary shares have a fair market value of 17.50 per share, then upon the cashless exercise, the holder will receive 300 Class A ordinary shares. The holder would have received 875 Class A ordinary shares if the exercise price was paid in cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential upside of the holder s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants.

 The warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and there is no information regarding such other security at this time. 
 
 In certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company for which there is no information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business combination. 
 We may be a passive foreign investment company PFIC ), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. 
 
 If we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception. Depending on the particular circumstances, the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a qualified electing fund election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. investors to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. 
 
 We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders. 
 
 If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is consummated, we will, and if we consummate an initial business combination with another target, and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation. 
 
 We may domesticate under the laws of a state of the United States (the U.S. domestication in connection with our initial business combination and after such U.S. domestication any redemptions of our common stock may result in a new 1 excise taxes imposed on us. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of certain repurchases (including certain redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations (and certain non-U.S. corporations treated as surrogate foreign corporations ). The excise tax will apply to stock repurchases occurring in 2023 and beyond. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares of stock repurchased at the time of the repurchase. The U.S. Department of Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. 
 
 The 1 excise tax is not expected to apply to redemptions of our stock to the extent such redemptions occur prior to the U.S. domestication (absent any regulations and other additional guidance that may be issued in the future with retroactive effect). However, absent any additional guidance, if the U.S. domestication occurs prior to the redemptions, we currently expect to be subject to the excise tax with respect to any redemptions of our common stock in connection with the initial business combination that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of us). In all cases, the extent of the excise tax that may be incurred would depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of the common stock redeemed, the extent such redemptions could be treated as dividends and not repurchases, and the content of any regulations and other additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that may be issued and applicable to the redemptions. Issuances of stock by a repurchasing corporation in a year in which such corporation repurchases stock may reduce the amount of excise tax imposed 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 with respect to such repurchase. It is not clear to what extent such reduction would be available with respect to redemptions of our common stock. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to us (or the cash contribution to the target company or business in connection with the initial business combination). 
 
 After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights. 
 
 It is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws. 
 
 We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights. 
 
 In connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. 
 
 The securities in the Trust Account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than 10.00 per share. 
 
 The proceeds held in the Trust Account are invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the Trust Account, plus any interest income not released to us, net of taxes payable. Negative interest rates could impact the per-share redemption amount that may be received by public shareholders. In addition, we are allowed to remove permitted withdrawals to pay our taxes; this means that even with a positive interest rate, most or all of the interest income may be withdrawn by us and not be available to fund our business combination or to be returned to investors upon a redemption. 
 
 Our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results and thus may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. 
 
 On April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (the SEC Statement ). Specifically, the SEC Statement focused on warrants that have certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers or warrants which do not meet the criteria to be considered indexed to an entity s own stock, which terms are similar to those contained in the warrant agreement governing our warrants. As a result of the SEC Statement, we evaluated the accounting treatment of our 20,000,000 Public Warrants and 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, and determined that the Warrants should be recorded as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings. 
 
 As a result, included on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K are derivative liabilities related to embedded features contained within our Warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts on an Entity's Own Equity , provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the audited statements of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our financial 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors, which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our Warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material. The volatility introduced by changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on our quarterly financial results. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 We are an early stage company with no revenues or basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 
 
 We are an early stage with no revenues or basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We may be unable to complete an initial business combination, including the proposed Business Combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. 
 
 Past performance by Ares or its affiliates or our directors and executive officers, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders. 
 
 Information regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, Ares or its affiliates or our directors and executive officers is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience and performance of Ares or its affiliates or our directors and executive officers is not a guarantee either: (i) that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination; or (ii) of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of Ares or its affiliates or our directors and executive officers performance as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us, including whether we can provide an attractive return to our shareholders, or as indicative of every prior investment by our directors and executive officers. Ares and our directors and executive officers have had limited experience with blank check companies and special purpose acquisition companies. The market price of our securities may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, and our shareholders may experience losses on their investment in our securities. 
 
 Cybersecurity failures and data security incidents could adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential, personal or other sensitive information and/or damage to our business relationships, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 We and our Sponsor and its affiliates face increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber and security threats, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to more advanced and persistent attacks. We may be a target for attacks because we are affiliated with an alternative asset management firm and may hold confidential and other price sensitive information, including price information, about existing and potential investments. We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of Ares and its third party vendors, and other third parties. Cyber-attacks and other security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside or inside parties. As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to confidential, personal or other sensitive information resulting from an attack by computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists. 
 
 The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems, as well as data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, which are vulnerable to security breaches and cyber incidents. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. In addition, we and our employees may be the target of fraudulent emails or other targeted attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary or sensitive information. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships. Any processes, procedures and internal controls we may implement to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, will not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident, especially because the techniques of threat actors change frequently and are often not recognized until launched and because cyber-incidents can originate from a wide variety of sources. We may not have sufficient funding and resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to continually monitor and enhance our cybersecurity procedures and controls.

The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial conditions subsequent to consummation of an initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to an initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any share dividends prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

 On June 5, 2020, the Sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain offering and formation costs of the Company in consideration of the Company s Class B ordinary shares. On January 13, 2021, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of the Company s independent directors. These 150,000 Class B ordinary shares were not subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters over-allotment was not exercised. The Sponsor had agreed to forfeit up to 3,262,500 Class B ordinary shares to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full so that the Class B ordinary shares will represent, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. Through February 4, 2021, the Company effectuated share recapitalizations resulting in the Sponsor (and its permitted transferees) holding an aggregate of 25,012,500 Class B ordinary shares. On February 4, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option; thus, 12,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares were forfeited. 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, including 1,733,333 additional Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, for an aggregate purchase price of 23.0 million, in a private placement to the Sponsor. This issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 
 Use of Proceeds 
 
 In connection with the Initial Public Offering, we incurred offering costs of approximately 55.9 million (including deferred underwriting commissions of 35.0 million). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally preparation fees related to the Initial Public Offering. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion, which amount will be payable upon consummation of the initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the Initial Public Offering expenses, 1.0 billion of the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds from the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants (or 10.00 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering) was placed in the Trust Account. The net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are held in the Trust Account and invested as described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this annual report on Form 10-K. This section of the annual report on Form 10-K discusses activity as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For discussion on activity for the period from January 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 and period-over-period analysis on results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the period from January 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and certainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements , Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a blank check company formed on January 24, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
 
 The issuance of additional ordinary shares in connection with a business combination: 
 
 may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the Initial Public Offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; 
 
 may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 
 
 could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 
 
 may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; 
 
 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants; and 
 
 may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants. 
 
 Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: 
 
 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
 
 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
 
 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 
 69 

Table of Contents 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
 
 our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; 
 
 using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
 
 limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 
 
 increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or prevailing interest rates; 
 
 limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt; and 
 
 other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
 
 As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 38,000 in our operating bank account. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of initial business combinations. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 
 
 Trends Affecting Our Business 
 
 We continue to evaluate the impact of increases in inflation and rising interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine and the surrounding region, and have concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the risks and uncertainties related to or resulting from these events could have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or ability to complete an initial business combination. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Business Combination Agreement with X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC 
 
 On December 5, 2022, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with X-energy, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, the combined company will be organized in an umbrella partnership C corporation structure, in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined company will be held by X-energy. The combined company s business will continue to operate through X-energy and its subsidiaries. In connection with the Closing, the Company will change its name to X-Energy, Inc. . See Item 1. Business Proposed Business Combination for a description of the proposed Business Combination with X-energy and the related agreements. 
 
 The proposed Business Combination is subject to, among other things, the approval of the proposed Business Combination by the Company s shareholders, satisfaction of the conditions stated in the Business Combination Agreement and other customary closing conditions, including that the SEC completes its review of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and the approval by the NYSE to list the securities of the combined company. 
 
 Extension 
 
 On February 2, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of shareholders and approved a proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023 to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. In connection with the approval of the Extension, shareholders elected to redeem 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 an aggregate of 53,002,919 ordinary shares, of which the Company paid cash from the Trust Account in the aggregate amount of approximately 539.0 million (approximately 10.17 per share) to redeeming shareholders. 
 
 Extension Promissory Note 
 
 On January 26, 2023, our Sponsor agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Trust Account of 0.03 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of 1.2 million per month following the approval and implementation of the Extension. Such Contributions will be made pursuant to the Extension Promissory Note issued by us to our Sponsor. Such Contributions, which will be paid monthly (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a full month), began on February 3, 2023, and thereafter on the first day of each month (or if such first day is not a business day, on the business day immediately preceding such first day) until the Maturity Date. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Our entire activity since inception through December 31, 2022 related to our formation, the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance, as well as for due diligence expenses. 
 
 We classify the warrants issued in connection with our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrant instruments to fair value at each reporting period. These liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statements of operations. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 20,983,590, which consisted of a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 15,228,589 and investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 13,097,713, offset by general and administrative costs of 7,342,712. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of 15,849,072, which consisted of a change in the fair value of warrant liabilities of 23,703,427 and investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 284,779, offset by offering costs of 1,677,518 and general and administrative costs of 6,461,616. 
 
 Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 38,000 in our operating bank account and working capital deficit of approximately 9.6 million. 
 
 Our liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through (i) a contribution of 25,000 from Sponsor to cover for certain expenses in exchange for the issuance of the Class B ordinary shares, (ii) a loan of 278,085 from the Sponsor pursuant to the Promissory Note (see Note 4), (iii) proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account which we repaid in full on February 4, 2021, and (iv) a working capital loan agreement with the Sponsor (the Working Capital Loan ), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to 2,500,000 (see Note 4). As of December 31, 2022, there was 1,500,000 outstanding under the Working Capital Loan. 
 
 In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the extended mandatory liquidation as approved on February 2, 2023 and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through August 4, 2023, the extended mandatory liquidation date of the Company, if it is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination prior to such date. However, we have access to funds from the Sponsor that are sufficient to fund our working capital needs until a potential business combination or up to the extended mandatory liquidation. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 16,667 for general and administrative services including office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support. This 
 71

 arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the Trust Account to the public shareholders. 
 
 In addition, the Company has entered into certain arrangements with third-party advisors, including the following: 
 
 The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 35.0 million. The deferred fee will be waived by the underwriters in the event that we do not complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 
 
 The Company has entered into fee arrangement with certain service providers pursuant to which certain transaction fees and service fees will become payable only if the Company consummates the proposed Business Combination. If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy does not occur, the Company will not be required to pay these contingent fees. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of these contingent fees with the service providers were approximately 13.2 million. 
 
 The Company has entered into a fee arrangement with capital markets advisors pursuant to which the Company will pay to each capital markets advisor an incentive fee of 2,250,000 so long as the sum of any funds raised in a securities private placement plus the funds raised in X-energy s interim financing transactions plus funds in the Trust Account exceed 500,000,000, and if the Company consummates the proposed Business Combination with X-energy. 
 
 Additionally, the Company has entered into a fee arrangement with placement agents pursuant to which certain placement fees ranging from 2.25 to 4.5 of funds raised in a private placement transaction (net of proceeds invested by affiliates of the Company or the Sponsor), will become payable only if the Company consummates the proposed Business Combination with X-energy. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies: 
 
 Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 
 
 We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our Class A ordinary shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 100,000,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our balance sheets. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share 
 
 The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 
 
 72 

Table of Contents 

 The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, because the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. 
 
 Warrant Liabilities 
 
 We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued share purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 We account for our 20,000,000 Public Warrants and 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s statements of operations. The Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering were initially measured at fair value using a modified Black-Scholes model and subsequently measured based on the listed market price of such warrants, whereas the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was initially and subsequently measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at each measurement date. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Our management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncement if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. government securities. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a material misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, WithumSmith+Brown, PC, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information. 
 
 Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 
 
 Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, require an issuer to disclose in its annual and quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran. The Company s Sponsor is a subsidiary of Ares, a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager. The description that follows has been provided to us by Ares. 
 
 On January 31, 2019, funds and accounts managed by Ares European direct lending strategy (together, the Ares funds collectively acquired a 32 equity stake in Daisy Group Limited Daisy ). Daisy is a provider of communication services to businesses based in the United Kingdom. The Ares funds do not hold a majority equity interest in Daisy and do not have the right to appoint a majority of directors to Daisy s board of directors. 
 
 Subsequent to completion of the Ares funds investment in Daisy, in connection with Ares routine quarterly survey of its investment funds portfolio companies, Daisy informed the Ares funds that it has a customer contract with Melli Bank Plc. Melli Bank Plc has been designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of Treasury pursuant to Executive Order 13224. Daisy generated a total of 41,546 in annual revenues in 2021 (less than 0.01 of Daisy s annual revenues) from its dealings with Melli Bank Plc and de minimis net profits. Daisy entered into the customer contract with Melli Bank Plc prior to the Ares funds investment in Daisy. 
 
 Daisy terminated its contract with Melli Bank Plc on February 26, 2022. Following termination of the contract, Daisy has not engaged and does not intend to engage in any further dealings or transactions with Melli Bank Plc.

 Conflicts of Interest 
 
 Under Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties: 
 
 duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole; 
 
 duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose; 
 
 directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion; 
 
 duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders; 
 
 duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and 
 
 duty to exercise independent judgment. 
 
 Directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience of that director. 
 
 As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at shareholder meetings. 
 
 Certain of our directors and executive officers currently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, Ares and the Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies. 
 
 These funds may have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts may arise with respect to Ares decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which such director or executive officer has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including any Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies, or another entity affiliated with one of our directors), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, such person will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Ares, the Ares funds or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. Investment ideas generated within or presented to Ares or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Ares, a current or future Ares fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, will first be directed to Ares, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. None of Ares or any of our directors and executive officers who are also employed by Ares or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware in their capacities as employees of Ares, its funds or their portfolio companies. However, we do not expect these duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest 
 80 

Table of Contents 

 extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. 
 
 We may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with Ares, one or more parties affiliated with Ares, including without limitation, officers and affiliates of Ares or Ares funds, or investors in such Ares funds, or another entity affiliated with one of our directors. Any such party may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such parties a class of equity or debt securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such joint acquisition or specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. 
 
 Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our officers and directors including, our chief executive officer, David B. Kaplan, are and in the future will be required to commit time and attention to Ares and Ares funds. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, any of such entities (including arising as a result of certain of officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such entities), Ares and its affiliated funds will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor.

 Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest: 
 
 Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. 
 
 In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 
 
 Our Sponsor subscribed for Class B ordinary shares prior to the date of the Initial Public Offering and purchased Private Placement Warrants in a transaction that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. 
 
 Our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Class B ordinary shares and public shares in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. Additionally, our sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to its Class B ordinary shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. If we do not consummate an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. Except as described herein, our sponsor and our directors and executive officers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Class B ordinary shares until the earliest of (a) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (b) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. The Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial business combination. Because each of our executive officers and director nominees will own ordinary shares or warrants directly or indirectly, they may have a conflict of 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. 
 
 Our Sponsor, directors or executive officers or any of their affiliates may make additional investments in us in connection with our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. If our sponsor or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, any Ares funds or their portfolio companies) elect to make additional investments or provide financing, such proposed transactions could influence our sponsor s motivation to complete our initial business combination. Ares and its affiliates and certain of the Ares funds engage in the business of originating, underwriting, syndicating, acquiring and trading loans and debt securities of corporate and other borrowers, and may provide or participate in any debt financing arrangement in connection with any acquisition, financing or disposition of any target business that we may make. 
 
 Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Our directors and officers or Ares or its affiliates may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Funds managed by Ares may have provided debt to companies we pursue and such debt may or may not be paid off in connection with a potential business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates and the director and officer teams. 
 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Furthermore, in no event will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by the company any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination. Further, commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we pay our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support provided to us in the amount of 16,667 per month. 
 
 We cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor. 
 
 In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our sponsor, directors and executive officers have agreed to vote their Class B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. 
 
 Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
 
 Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We entered into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We obtained a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 
 
 Our officers and directors have agreed, and any persons who may become officers or directors prior to the initial business combination will agree, to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the Trust Account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. 
 83 

Table of Contents 

Our indemnification obligations may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
 
 We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation. 
 
 None of our executive officers or directors have received any cash compensation from the company for services rendered to the Company. Commencing on the date that our securities were first listed on the NYSE through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, we agreed to pay our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support provided to us in the amount of 16,667 per month. The Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, and their respective affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid by the Company to our Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination. 
 
 After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or executive officers who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or executive officers. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 
 
 We do not intend to take any action to ensure that our directors and executive officers maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our directors and executive officer s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our directors and executive officers to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 
 
 Class B ordinary Shares 
 
 On June 5, 2020, our Sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain offering and formation costs in consideration of our Class B ordinary shares. On January 13, 2021, our Sponsor transferred 50,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of our independent directors. These 150,000 Class B ordinary shares were not subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters over-allotment was not exercised. Our Sponsor had agreed to forfeit up to 3,262,500 Class B ordinary shares to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full so that the Class B ordinary shares would represent, on an as- 
 85

 converted basis, 20 of our issued and outstanding shares after our Initial Public Offering. Through February 4, 2021, we effectuated share recapitalizations resulting in our Sponsor (and its permitted transferees) holding an aggregate of 25,012,500 Class B ordinary shares. On February 4, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option; thus, 12,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares were forfeited. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert on a one-for-one basis into Class A ordinary shares upon the Closing or another initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments. 
 
 Pursuant to a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement ), our Sponsor and our officers and directors agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any Class B ordinary shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the Closing or another initial business combination, or (ii) subsequent to the Closing or another initial business combination, (a) if the last reported sale price of Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination, or (b) subsequent to the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination, the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. However, in connection with the proposed Business Combination, this provision of the Letter Agreement will be superseded by the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement, pursuant to which the Purchaser Support Parties and their respective permitted assigns will agree not to, without the prior written consent of the New X-energy Board, transfer the shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock or New X-energy Warrants received upon conversion of the 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares owned by the Purchaser Support Parties and warrants exercisable for Class A ordinary shares prior to the date that is twelve months after the Closing Date. 
 
 Promissory Note 
 
 On June 5, 2020, we issued a promissory note to our Sponsor, pursuant to which our Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate of 300,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to our Initial Public Offering, which was amended and restated on December 31, 2020 (the Promissory Note ). The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable upon the completion of our Initial Public Offering. We had borrowed 278,085 under the Promissory Note and fully repaid the Promissory Note on February 4, 2021. Borrowings under the Promissory Note are no longer available. 
 
 Private Placement Warrants 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of our Initial Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 15,333,333 Private Placement Warrants, including 1,733,333 additional Private Placement Warrants to cover over allotments, for an aggregate purchase price of 23.0 million, in a private placement to our Sponsor. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A ordinary shares at a price of 11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from our Initial Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If we do not complete the proposed Business Combination or complete an alternative initial business combination by August 4, 2023, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. 
 
 Working Capital Loan 
 
 On March 1, 2022, we entered into a working capital loan agreement, pursuant to which we may borrow up to 2,500,000, for ongoing business expenses and the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination. The Working Capital Loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable upon the Closing or another initial business combination. If we complete the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loan out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loan would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loan, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loan. The Working Capital Loan would either be repaid upon the Closing or another initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loan may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 1,500,000 and no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Loan, respectively, as reflected in our balance sheets contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

 Administrative Service Fee 
 
 We have agreed, commencing on the date of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor, a monthly fee of 16,667 for general and administrative services including office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination or the distribution of the Trust Account to our public shareholders. We incurred 200,004 and 183,337 in expenses in connection with such services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses were presented within general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company did not incur administrative service fee for the period from January 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding balance in accrued expenses - related party in connection with such services as reflected in our balance sheets contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Advances from Related Parties 
 
 Affiliates of our Sponsor paid certain operating costs on behalf of us. These advances are due on demand and are non-interest bearing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 60,921 and 46,900, respectively, in accrued expenses related party as reflected in our balance sheets included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Registration and Shareholder Rights Agreement 
 
 We have previously entered into a registration and shareholder rights agreement pursuant to which our Sponsor will be entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, the warrants that may be issuable upon conversion of the Working Capital Loan and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, and, upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination. At the Closing, we, the Sponsor, certain X-energy Members, our independent directors and the Series C-2 Investors will enter into an Amended Restated Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, our Sponsor, such X-energy Members and our independent directors will be granted certain customary registration rights, on the terms and subject to the conditions therein, with respect to securities of New X-energy that they will hold following the proposed Business Combination. 
 
 Support Agreement 
 
 The Purchaser Support Parties have entered into an agreement with X-energy, pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed, among other things: (i) vote (or act by written consent) and approve the Business Combination Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including in favor of each Transaction Proposal; (ii) to waive, subject to the consummation of the proposed Business Combination, any and all anti-dilution rights with respect to the rate that the Class B ordinary shares owned by our Sponsor and our independent directors convert into Class A ordinary shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement; and (iii) to certain vesting and forfeiture terms with respect to up to 50 of the Sponsor Earn Out Securities beneficially owned by the Purchaser Support Parties immediately following the Closing. 
 
 Commitment Letter 
 
 On December 5, 2022, we and X-energy entered into the Commitment Letter with the Investor, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Investor has committed that it or its affiliated vehicles or designees purchase in a private placement, to close immediately prior to the Closing, 45,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 1,000.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of up to 45.0 million, as such amounts may be reduced pursuant to the Commitment Letter. The PIPE Commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount by which (i) the sum of (a) the amount of cash available in the Trust Account immediately prior to the Closing, less amounts required for the Redemptions (to the extent not already paid); plus (b) the aggregate proceeds, if any, actually received by us from the PIPE Investment (including any amount actually funded pursuant to the Commitment Letter); plus (c) the aggregate amount actually funded to X-energy in connection with any Permitted Financing prior to January 15, 2023, exceeds (ii) 400,000,000. In no event shall any reduction to the PIPE Commitment exceed 25.0 million in the aggregate. X-energy and the Investor may also mutually agree to reduce the amount of the PIPE Commitment. If we enter into subscription or similar agreements with Other Investors pursuant to which the Other Investors agree to purchase Alternative Securities substantially concurrently with the Closing, then the obligations of the Investor under the PIPE Commitment will be null and void. In such event, the Investor will enter into a subscription or similar agreement on the same terms and conditions as the Other Investors to purchase Alternative Securities having an aggregate purchase price of 45,000,000, subject to cutbacks based on the formula in the Commitment Letter.

 The Guarantor has provided X-energy with a limited guaranty in favor of X-energy, dated December 5, 2022, with respect to certain of the Investor s obligations under the Commitment Letter. 
 
 Extension Promissory Note 
 
 On January 26, 2023, our Sponsor agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Trust Account of 0.03 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of 1.2 million per month following the approval and implementation of the Extension. Such Contributions will be made pursuant to the Extension Promissory Note issued by us to our Sponsor. If the Extension is approved, such Contributions, which will be paid monthly (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a full month), began on February 3, 2023, and thereafter on the first day of each month (or if such first day is not a business day, on the business day immediately preceding such first day) until the Maturity Date. 
 
 Policy for Approval of Related Party Transactions 
 
 The audit committee of our board operates pursuant to a charter, providing for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions, which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee is provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that we have already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to us and to the relevant related party. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction. 
 
 Director Independence 
 
 NYSE listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the directors exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Kathryn Marinello, Stephen Davis and Felicia Thornton are independent directors as defined in the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services. 
 
 The following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to WithumSmith+Brown, PC Withum for services rendered. 
 
 Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Withum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Withum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 112,224. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings. 
 
 Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Withum for audit related fees for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Tax Fees. We did not pay Withum for tax fees for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 All Other Fees. We did not pay Withum for other services for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Pre-Approval Policy 
 
 Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, 
 88 

Table of Contents 

 the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Ares Acquisition Corporation 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Ares Acquisition Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by (COSO). 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Ares Acquisition Corporation 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Ares Acquisition Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the period from January 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the period from January 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business combination by August 4, 2023 then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Accounting for and Valuation of Private Placement Warrants 
 
 Description: 
 
 As described in Notes 2, 7 and 8 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for its private placement warrants based on an assessment of the instruments specific terms and the applicable accounting standards. The private placement warrants are stated at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded on the statement of operations. The fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance and through September 30, 2022 were estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and as of December 31, 2022 using the fair value of the Public Warrants. As of December 31, 2022, 15,333,333 private 
 F-3 

Table of Contents 

 placement warrants at a fair value of 7.15 million remained outstanding resulting in 6.73 million of gain related to the change in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2022. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for and valuation of the private placement warrants are a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the accounting for and valuation; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the accounting for the private placement warrants, and management s significant assumptions related to the expected volatility while relying on the Black-Scholes option pricing model prior to the change in valuation methodology; (iii) the judgment to determine that the private placement warrants qualified as a similar security to the public warrant in an active market and (iv) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Response: 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included, among others, reading the agreements, evaluating the accounting for the private placement warrants, testing the internal controls over management s process for determining the fair value estimates. Testing management s process included (i) evaluating the internal controls and methodology used by management to determine the fair value of the private placement warrants; (ii) testing the mathematical accuracy of management s model; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant assumptions (if any); and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in (i) evaluating management s accounting for the private placement warrants at the beginning of the period; (ii) evaluating the methodology to determine the fair value; (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy of the models; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used at the beginning of the period related to implied volatility and probability of executing a successful business combination by considering consistency with external market data, and (v) evaluating the private placement warrants characteristics and settlement options to determine that it qualified as a similar security to the public warrant.

Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants ), including additional Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, for an aggregate purchase price of million, in a private placement to Ares Acquisition Holdings L.P., a Cayman Island limited partnership (the Sponsor (see Note 4). 
 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, billion per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account Trust Account located in the United States and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. 
 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 
 The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the consummation of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to convert their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to the Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (see Note 5). The Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards

 or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 
 
 The initial shareholders have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Class B ordinary shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) not to propose an amendment to (a) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of its Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of the Company s Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Combination Period (as defined below) or (b) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 
 The Company has until August 4, 2023 to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less of interest to pay dissolution expenses), which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 
 The initial shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Class B ordinary shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 
 
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the extended mandatory liquidation as approved on February 2, 2023 and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through August 4, 2023, the extended mandatory liquidation date of the Company, if it is unsuccessful in consummating an initial Business Combination prior to such date. The Company has access to funds from the Sponsor that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until a potential business combination or up to the extended mandatory liquidation. Management further intends to close the Proposed Business Combination before the extended mandatory liquidation date.

 Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s balance sheets. 
 
 The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Class A ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.

 Assets, at fair value Investments held in Trust Account: Liabilities, at fair value Public Warrants Private Placement Warrants 
 
 The Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the Company s balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the Company s statements of operations. 
 
 The Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering were initially measured at fair value using a modified Black-Scholes model and subsequently measured based on the listed market price of such warrants, whereas the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was initially and subsequently measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model at each measurement date. As the fair value of the Public Warrants is based on the use of an observable market quote in an active market, the Public Warrants are classified as Level 1. 
 
 At December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The underlying assumptions in the Black-Scholes option pricing model include the underlying share price, risk-free interest rate, estimated volatility and the expected term. The underlying share price is based on the trading ordinary share price or implied from the unit price (before the ordinary shares are trading separately), which consists of one ordinary share and one-fifth Public Warrant. The expected share price volatility is based on (i) the observed volatility of a group of comparable publicly traded companies observed over a historical period equal to the expected remaining life of the warrants and (ii) the implied volatility of the Public Warrants calculated using publicly observable prices. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of valuation equal to the remaining expected life of the warrants. The dividend yield percentage is zero because the Company does not currently pay dividends, nor does it intend to do so during the expected term of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The primary significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Private Placement Warrants is the expected volatility of the ordinary share. Significant increases (decreases) in the expected volatility in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. In determining the expected volatility, the Company derived the expected volatility from observable pricing of the Public Warrants.
