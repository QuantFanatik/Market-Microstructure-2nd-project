 Transmission 
 Transmission lines deliver electricity over long distances from power sources to transmission substations closer to customers. A strong transmission system ensures continued reliable and affordable service, ability to meet state and regional energy policy goals, and support for a diverse generation mix, including renewable energy. NSP-Wisconsin owns approximately 12,000 of 44,000 conductor miles of transmission lines across the NSP System service territory. 

NSP System plans to build approximately 1,100 additional conductor miles of transmission lines, primarily as part of the MISO Tranche 1 project estimated to be complete in 2028. 
 See Item 2 Properties for further information. 
 
 Distribution 
 Distribution lines allow electricity to travel at lower voltages from substations directly to customers. NSP-Wisconsin has a vast distribution network, owning and operating approximately 28,000 conductor miles of distribution lines across our service territory. To continue providing reliable, affordable electric service and enable more flexibility for customers, we are working to digitize the distribution grid, while at the same time keeping it secure. 
 See Item 2 Properties for further information. 
 
 Natural Gas Operations 
 
 Natural gas operations consist of purchase, transportation, and distribution of natural gas to end-use residential, C I and transport customers. NSP-Wisconsin had natural gas deliveries of 23,038 (thousands of MMBtu), 0.1 million customers and natural gas revenues of 198 million for 2022.

 General 
 Seasonality 
 Demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In general, peak sales of electricity occur in the summer months and peak sales of natural gas occur in the winter months. As a result, the overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Additionally, NSP-Wisconsin s operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. 
 Competition 
 NSP-Wisconsin is subject to public policies that promote competition and development of energy markets. NSP-Wisconsin s industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region. 
 Customers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation and in most jurisdictions can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them. 
 Wisconsin has incentives for the development of rooftop solar, community solar gardens and other distributed energy resources. Distributed generating resources are potential competitors to NSP-Wisconsin s electric service business with these incentives and federal tax subsidies. 
 FERC Order No. 1000 established competition for ownership of certain new electric transmission facilities under Federal regulations. Some states have state laws that allow the incumbent a Right of First Refusal to own these transmission facilities. 
 FERC Order 2222 requires that RTO and ISO markets allow participation of aggregations of distributed energy resources. This order is expected to incentivize distributed energy resource adoption, however implementation is expected to vary by RTO/ISO and the near, medium, and long-term impacts of Order 2222 remain unclear. 
 NSP-Wisconsin has franchise agreements with cities subject to periodic renewal; however, a city could seek alternative means to access electric power or gas, such as municipalization. No municipalization activities are occurring presently. 
 While facing these challenges, NSP-Wisconsin believes its rates and services are competitive with alternatives currently available. 
 
 Governmental Regulations 
 Public Utility Regulation 
 See Item 7 for discussion of public utility regulation. 

Environmental Regulation 
 Our facilities are regulated by federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction over air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes or substances. Certain NSP-Wisconsin activities require registrations, permits, licenses, inspections and approvals from these agencies. 
 NSP-Wisconsin has received necessary authorizations for the construction and continued operation of its generation, transmission and distribution systems. Our facilities strive to operate in compliance with applicable environmental standards and related monitoring and reporting requirements. 
 However, it is not possible to determine what additional facilities or modifications to existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to regulations, interpretations or enforcement policies or what effect future laws or regulations may have. We may be required to incur expenditures in the future for remediation of historic and current operating sites and other waste treatment, storage and disposal sites. 
 There are significant environmental regulations to encourage use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. NSP-Wisconsin has undertaken numerous initiatives to meet current requirements and prepare for potential future regulations, reduce GHG emissions and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Future environmental regulations may result in substantial costs. 
 Emerging Environmental Regulation 
 Clean Air Act In April 2022, the EPA proposed regulations under the "Good Neighbor" provisions of the Clean Air Act. The proposed rules establish an allowance trading program for NOx, potentially impacting fossil fuel generating facilities in the NSP System. Under the proposed rule, facilities without NOx controls will have to secure additional allowances, install NOx controls, or develop a strategy of operations that utilizes the existing allowance allocations.The EPA has indicated that it intends for the rule to be final and applicable in the first half of 2023. While the financial impacts of the proposed regulation are uncertain and dependent on market forces, NSP-Wisconsin anticipates that the costs to the NSP System will be approximately 30 million annually and will be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms based on prior state commission practices. 
 In a June 2022 ruling, the United States Supreme Court held that an economy-wide approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants was not consistent with the Clean Air Act. Therefore, if the EPA proceeds with new rules, it cannot set a standard based on economy-wide generation shifting to other sources, such as renewable energy. It is anticipated that EPA will propose rules to limit GHG emissions from new and existing coal and natural gas-fired electric generating units in 2023. If any new rules require additional investment, NSP-Wisconsin believes that the cost of these initiatives or replacement generation would be recoverable through rates based on prior state commission practices. 
 Coal Ash Regulation In February 2023, the EPA entered into a Consent Decree, committing the agency to either issue new proposed rules by May 5, 2023, to regulate inactive CCR landfills under the CCR Rule for the first time, or to determine no such rules are necessary by that date. If proposed rules are issued in May, the EPA has committed to a May 2024 effective date for the new rules. Until proposed rules are issued, it is not certain what the impact will be on the NSP System, but we anticipate that additional inactive ash units could become regulated for the first time. It is also anticipated that the EPA may issue other CCR proposed rules in 2023 that further expand the scope of the CCR Rule.

 Emerging Contaminants of Concern PFAS are man-made chemicals that are widely used in consumer products and can persist and bio-accumulate in the environment. NSP-Wisconsin does not manufacture PFAS but because PFAS are so ubiquitous in products and the environment, it may impact our operations. In September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two types of PFAS as hazardous substances under the CERCLA, specifically perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. This proposed rule could result in new obligations for investigation and cleanup wherever PFAS are found to be present. The impact the proposed regulation may have on electric and gas utilities is currently uncertain. 
 Other 
 Our operations are subject to workplace safety standards under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of worker health and safety. In addition, the Company is subject to other government regulations impacting such matters as labor, competition, data privacy, etc. Based on information to date and because our policies and business practices are designed to comply with all applicable laws, we do not believe the effects of compliance on our operations, financial condition or cash flows are material. 
 
 Employees 
 As of Dec. 31, 2022, NSP-Wisconsin had 541 full-time employees and one part-time employee, of which 397 were covered under collective-bargaining agreements. 
 
 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 
 Xcel Energy, which includes NSP-Wisconsin, is subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control. Risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risks should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and future reports that we file with the SEC. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. 
 Oversight of Risk and Related Processes 
 NSP-Wisconsin s Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of material risk and maintaining an effective risk monitoring process. Management and the Board of Directors have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of key risks. 
 NSP-Wisconsin maintains a robust compliance program and promotes a culture of compliance beginning with the tone at the top. The risk mitigation process includes adherence to our Code of Conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management. NSP-Wisconsin further mitigates inherent risks through formal risk committees and corporate functions such as internal audit, and internal controls over financial reporting and legal. 

Management identifies and analyzes risks to determine materiality and other attributes such as timing, probability and controllability. Identification and risk analysis occurs formally through risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, hazard risk procedures, internal audit and compliance with financial and operational controls. Management also identifies and analyzes risk through the business planning process, development of goals and establishment of key performance indicators, including identification of barriers to implementing our strategy. The business planning process also identifies likelihood and mitigating factors to prevent the assumption of inappropriate risk to meet goals. 
 Management communicates regularly with the Board of Directors and its sole stockholder regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to the Board of Directors providing information on the risks that management believes are material, including financial impact, timing, likelihood and mitigating factors. The Board of Directors regularly reviews management s key risk assessments, which includes areas of existing and future macroeconomic, financial, operational, policy, environmental, safety and security risks. 
 The oversight, management and mitigation of risk is an integral and continuous part of the Board of Directors governance of NSP-Wisconsin. Processes are in place to confirm appropriate risk oversight, as well as identification and consideration of new risks. 
 Risks Associated with Our Business 
 Operational Risks 
 Our natural gas and electric generation/transmission and distribution operations involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. 
 Our natural gas transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, outages and mechanical problems. Our electric generation, transmission and distribution activities include inherent hazards and operating risks such as contact, fire and outages. 
 These risks could result in loss of life, significant property damage, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses to employees, third-party contractors, customers or the public. We maintain insurance against most, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as potential loss of reputation.

 Other uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining NSP-Wisconsin's facilities include, but are not limited to: 
 Risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned. 
 Failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other supplies. 
 Impact of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, tornadoes, icing events, floods and droughts. 
 Performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency. 
 Availability of replacement equipment. 
 Availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements. 
 Availability or changes to wind patterns. 
 Inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects. 
 Use of new or unproven technology. 
 Risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel or fuel source, such as commodity price risk, availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation and lack of available alternative fuel sources. 
 Increased competition due to, among other factors, new facilities, excess supply, shifting demand and regulatory changes. 
 Additionally, compliance with existing and potential new regulations related to the operation and maintenance of our natural gas infrastructure could result in significant costs. The PHMSA is responsible for administering the DOT s national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines. The PHMSA continues to develop regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. We have programs in place to comply with these regulations and systematically monitor and renew infrastructure over time, however, a significant incident or material finding of non-compliance could result in penalties and higher costs of operations. 
 Our natural gas and electric transmission and distribution operations are dependent upon complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, the failure of which could disrupt our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to process transactions and provide services. 
 Our utility operations are subject to long-term planning and project risks. 
 Most electric utility investments are planned to be used for decades. Transmission and generation investments typically have long lead times and are planned well in advance of in-service dates and typically subject to long-term resource plans. These plans are based on numerous assumptions such as: sales growth, customer usage, commodity prices, economic activity, costs, regulatory mechanisms, customer behavior, available technology and public policy. Our long-term resource plan is dependent on our ability to obtain required approvals, develop necessary technical expertise, allocate and coordinate sufficient resources and adhere to budgets and timelines. 

In addition, the long-term nature of both our planning processes and our asset lives are subject to risk. The electric utility sector is undergoing significant change (e.g., increases in energy efficiency, wider adoption of distributed generation and shifts away from fossil fuel generation to renewable generation). Customer adoption of these technologies and increased energy efficiency could result in excess transmission and generation resources, downward pressure on sales growth, and potentially stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments. 
 The magnitude and timing of resource additions and changes in customer demand may not coincide with evolving customer preference for generation resources and end-uses, which introduces further uncertainty into long-term planning. Efforts to electrify the transportation and building sectors to reduce GHG emissions may result in higher electric demand and lower natural gas demand over time. Higher electric demand may require us to adopt new technologies and make significant transmission and distribution investments including advanced grid infrastructure, which increases exposure to overall grid instability and technology obsolescence. Evolving stakeholder preference for lower emissions from generation sources and end-uses, like heating, may impact our resource mix and put pressure on our ability to recover capital investments in natural gas generation and delivery. Multiple states may not agree as to the appropriate resource mix, which may lead to costs to comply with one jurisdiction that are not recoverable across all jurisdictions served by the same assets. 
 We require inputs such as coal, natural gas, uranium and water to cool our facilities. Lack of availability of these resources could jeopardize long-term operations of our facilities or make them uneconomic to operate. 
 Our utility operations are highly dependent on suppliers to deliver components in accordance with short and long-term project schedules. 
 Our products contain components that are globally sourced from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components in which an alternative supplier is not identified could significantly impact operations and project plans for NSP-Wisconsin and our customers. Such impacts could include timing of projects, including potential for project cancellation. Failure to adhere to project budgets and timelines adversely impacts our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 We are subject to commodity risks and other risks associated with energy markets and energy production. 
 A significant increase in fuel costs could cause a decline in customer demand, adverse regulatory outcomes and an increase in bad debt expense which may have a material impact on our results of operations. Despite existing fuel cost recovery mechanisms, higher fuel costs could significantly impact our results of operations if costs are not recovered. Delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries could impact our cash flows and liquidity. 
 A significant disruption in supply could cause us to seek alternative supply services at potentially higher costs. Additionally, supply shortages may not be fully resolved, which negatively impacts our ability to provide services to our customers. Failure to provide service due to disruptions may also result in fines, penalties or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Also, significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to sales commitments negatively impacts our cash flows and results of operations.

 We also engage in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity, energy and energy-related products as well as natural gas. In many markets, emission allowances and/or RECs are also needed to comply with various statutes and commission rulings. As a result, we are subject to market supply and commodity price risk. 
 Commodity price changes can affect the value of our commodity trading derivatives. We mark certain derivatives to estimated fair market value on a daily basis. Settlements can vary significantly from estimated fair values recorded and significant changes from the assumptions underlying our fair value estimates could cause earnings variability. The management of risks associated with hedging and trading is based, in part, on programs and procedures which utilize historical prices and trends. 
 Public perception often does not distinguish between pass through commodity costs and base rates. High commodity prices that are being passed through to customer bills could impact our ability to recover costs for other improvements and operations. 
 Due to the uncertainty involved in price movements and potential deviation from historical pricing, NSP-Wisconsin is unable to fully assure that its risk management programs and procedures would be effective to protect against all significant adverse market deviations. In addition, NSP-Wisconsin cannot fully assure that its controls will be effective against all potential risks. If such programs and procedures are not effective, NSP-Wisconsin s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially impacted. 
 Failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on operations. 
 The competition for talent has become increasingly prevalent, and we have experienced increased employee turnover due to the condition of the labor market. In addition, specialized knowledge and skills are required for many of our positions, which may pose additional difficulty for us as we work to recruit, retain and motivate employees in this climate. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant knowledge and expertise to new employees or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Inability to attract and retain these employees adversely impacts our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Our operations use third-party contractors in addition to employees to perform periodic and ongoing work. 
 We rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance and construction work. Our contractual arrangements with these contractors typically include performance and safety standards, progress payments, insurance requirements and security for performance. Poor vendor performance or contractor unavailability could impact ongoing operations, restoration operations, regulatory recovery, our reputation and could introduce financial risk or risks of fines. 

Our employees, directors, third-party contractors, or suppliers may violate or be perceived to violate our Codes of Conduct, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation. 
 We are exposed to risk of employee or third-party contractor fraud or misconduct. All employees and members of the Board of Directors are subject to comply with our Code of Conduct and are required to participate in annual training. Additionally, suppliers are subject to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. NSP-Wisconsin does not tolerate discrimination, violations of our Code of Conduct or other unacceptable behaviors. However, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third-parties, which may result in governmental investigations, other actions or lawsuits. If such actions are taken against us we may suffer loss of reputation and such actions could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Although we do not own any nuclear generating facilities, because our production and transmission system is operated on an integrated basis with NSP-Minnesota s (an affiliate of NSP-Wisconsin) production and transmission system, we may be subject to risks associated with NSP-Minnesota s nuclear generation. 
 NSP-Minnesota has two nuclear generation plants, Prairie Island and Monticello. Risks of nuclear generation include: 
 Hazards associated with the use of radioactive material in energy production, including management, handling, storage and disposal. 
 Limitations on insurance available to cover losses that may arise in connection with nuclear operations, as well as obligations to contribute to an insurance pool in the event of damages at a covered U.S. reactor. 
 Technological and financial uncertainties related to the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants may cause our funding obligations to change. 
 The NRC has authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including the ability to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is achieved. NRC safety requirements could necessitate substantial capital expenditures or an increase in operating expenses. In addition, the INPO reviews NSP-Minnesota s nuclear operations. Compliance with the INPO s recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses. 
 If a nuclear incident did occur, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, non-compliance or the occurrence of a serious incident at other nuclear facilities could result in increased industry regulation, which may increase NSP-Minnesota s compliance costs.

 We share in the electric production and transmission costs of the NSP-Minnesota system, which is integrated with our system. Accordingly, our costs may be increased due to increased costs associated with NSP-Minnesota s system. 
 Our electric production and transmission system is managed on an integrated basis with the electric production and transmission system of NSP-Minnesota. Pursuant to the Interchange Agreement between NSP-Minnesota and us, we share, on a proportional basis, all costs related to the generation and transmission facilities of the entire integrated NSP System, including capital costs. Accordingly, if the costs to operate the NSP System increase, or revenue decreases, whether as a result of state or federally mandated improvements or otherwise, our costs could also increase and our revenues could decrease and we cannot guarantee a full recovery of such costs through our rates at the time the costs are incurred. 
 We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. Xcel Energy Inc. can exercise substantial control over our dividend policy and business and operations and may exercise that control in a manner that may be perceived to be adverse to our interests. 
 All of the members of our Board of Directors, as well as many of our executive officers, are officers of Xcel Energy Inc. Our Board of Directors makes determinations with respect to a number of significant corporate events, including the payment of our dividends. 
 We have historically paid quarterly dividends to Xcel Energy Inc. If Xcel Energy Inc. s cash requirements increase, our Board of Directors could decide to increase the dividends we pay to Xcel Energy Inc. to help support Xcel Energy Inc. s cash needs. This could adversely affect our liquidity. The most restrictive dividend limitation for NSP-Wisconsin is imposed by our state regulatory commission. NSP-Wisconsin cannot pay annual dividends in excess of certain amounts if its calendar year average equity-to-total capitalization ratio is or falls below the state commission authorized level. 
 See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our profitability depends on our ability to recover costs and changes in regulation may impair our ability to recover costs from our customers. 
 We are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies, including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that we can charge customers. 
 The profitability of our operations is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services and earn a return on capital investment. Our rates are generally regulated and are based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a test year. We are subject to future test years. Thus, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. Rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. 
 There can also be no assurance that our regulatory commissions will judge all our costs to be prudent, which could result in disallowances, or that the regulatory process will always result in rates that will produce full recovery. 
 Overall, management believes prudently incurred costs are recoverable given the existing regulatory framework. However, there may be changes in the regulatory environment that could impair our ability to recover costs historically collected from customers, or we could exceed caps on capital costs required by commissions and result in less than full recovery. 
 Changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or to the operating conditions of our assets may result in early retirements of utility facilities. While 

regulation typically provides cost recovery relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs. 
 Higher than expected inflation or tariffs may increase costs of construction and operations. Also, rising fuel costs could increase the risk that we will not be able to fully recover our fuel costs from our customers. 
 Adverse regulatory rulings (including changes in recovery mechanisms) or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and materially affect our ability to meet our financial obligations, including debt payments and the payment of dividends on common stock. 
 Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. 
 We cannot be assured that our current credit ratings will remain in effect, or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency. Significant events including disallowance of costs, use of historic test years, elimination of riders or interim rates, increasing depreciation lives, lower returns on equity, changes to equity ratios and impacts of tax policy may impact our cash flows and credit metrics, potentially resulting in a change in our credit ratings. 
 In addition, our credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Any credit ratings downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs or lower proceeds from equity issuances. It could also impact our ability to access capital markets. Also, we may enter into contracts that require posting of collateral or settlement if credit ratings fall below investment grade. 
 We are subject to capital market and interest rate risks. 
 Utility operations require significant capital investment. As a result, we frequently need to access capital markets. Any disruption in capital markets could have a material impact on our ability to fund our operations. Capital market disruption and financial market distress could prevent us from issuing commercial paper, issuing new securities or cause us to issue securities with unfavorable terms and conditions, such as higher interest rates or lower proceeds from equity issuances. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 We are subject to credit risks. 
 Credit risk includes the risk that our customers will not pay their bills, which may lead to a reduction in our liquidity and an increase in bad debt expense. Credit risk is comprised of numerous factors including the price of products and services provided, the economy and unemployment rates. 
 Credit risk also includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or product will become insolvent and may breach their obligations. Should the counterparties fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected and incur losses. 
 We may have direct credit exposure as part of our local gas distribution company supply activity to financial institutions trading for their own accounts or issuing collateral support on behalf of other counterparties. We may also have some indirect credit exposure due to participation in organized markets, (e.g., MISO), in which any credit losses are socialized to all market participants.

Table of Contents 

 We have additional indirect credit exposure to financial institutions from letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the supplier would need to replace that security with an acceptable substitute. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract. 
 As we are a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., we may be negatively affected by events impacting the credit or liquidity of Xcel Energy Inc. and its affiliates. 
 If either Standard Poor s Global Ratings or Moody s Investor Services were to downgrade Xcel Energy Inc. s debt securities below investment grade, it would increase Xcel Energy Inc. s cost of capital and restrict its access to the capital markets. This could limit Xcel Energy Inc. s ability to contribute equity or make loans to us, or may cause Xcel Energy Inc. to seek additional or accelerated funding from us in the form of dividends. If such event were to occur, we may need to seek alternative sources of funds to meet our cash needs. 
 As of Dec. 31, 2022, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries had approximately 22.8 billion of long-term debt and 2.0 billion of short-term debt and current maturities. Xcel Energy Inc. provides various guarantees and bond indemnities supporting some of its subsidiaries by guaranteeing the payment or performance by these subsidiaries for specified agreements or transactions. 
 Xcel Energy also has other contingent liabilities resulting from various tax disputes and other matters. Xcel Energy Inc. s exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or transactions. The majority of Xcel Energy Inc. s guarantees limit its exposure to a maximum amount that is stated in the guarantees. 
 As of Dec. 31, 2022, Xcel Energy had the following guarantees outstanding: 
 1 million maximum stated amount and immaterial exposure. 
 61 million for performance and payment of surety bonds for the benefit of itself and its subsidiaries, with total exposure that cannot be estimated at this time. 
 98 million for performance and payment of a capital services contract for solar generating equipment, with immaterial exposure. 
 If Xcel Energy Inc. were to become obligated to make payments under these guarantees and bond indemnities or become obligated to fund other contingent liabilities, it could limit Xcel Energy Inc. s ability to contribute equity or make loans to us, or may cause Xcel Energy Inc. to seek additional or accelerated funding from us in the form of dividends. If such event were to occur, we may need to seek alternative sources of funds to meet our cash needs. 

Increasing costs of our defined benefit retirement plans and employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 We have defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that cover most of our employees. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements of these plans. Estimates and assumptions may change. In addition, the Pension Protection Act sets the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. Therefore, our funding requirements and contributions may change in the future. Also, the payout of a significant percentage of pension plan liabilities in a single year due to high numbers of retirements or employees leaving NSP-Wisconsin would trigger settlement accounting and could require NSP-Wisconsin to recognize incremental pension expense related to unrecognized plan losses in the year liabilities are paid. Changes in industry standards utilized in key assumptions (e.g., mortality tables) could have a significant impact on future obligations and benefit costs. 
 Increasing costs associated with health care plans may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Increasing levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Health care legislation could also significantly impact our benefit programs and costs. 
 Federal tax law may significantly impact our business. 
 NSP-Wisconsin collects estimated federal, state and local tax payments through their regulated rates. Changes to federal tax law may benefit or adversely affect our earnings and customer costs. Tax depreciable lives and the value/availability of various tax credits or the timeliness of their utilization may impact the economics or selection of resources. If tax rates are increased, there could be timing delays before regulated rates provide for recovery of such tax increases in revenues. In addition, certain IRS tax policies such as tax normalization may impact our ability to economically deliver certain types of resources relative to market prices. 
 Macroeconomic Risks 
 Economic conditions impact our business. 
 Our operations are affected by economic conditions, which correlates to customers/sales growth (decline). Economic conditions may be impacted by recessionary factors, rising interest rates and insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which may impact customers ability to pay their bills which could lead to additional bad debt expense. 
 Additionally, NSP-Wisconsin faces competitive factors, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, worldwide economic activity impacts the demand for basic commodities necessary for utility infrastructure, which may inhibit our ability to acquire sufficient supplies. We operate in a capital intensive industry and federal trade policy could significantly impact the cost of materials we use. There may be delays before these additional material costs can be recovered in rates.

 We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Health epidemics continue to impact countries, communities, supply chains and markets. Uncertainty continues to exist regarding epidemics; the duration and magnitude of business restrictions including shutdowns (domestically and globally); the potential impact on the workforce including shortages of employees and third-party contractors due to quarantine policies, vaccination requirements or government restrictions; impacts on the transportation of goods, and the generalized impact on the economy. 
 We cannot ultimately predict whether an epidemic will have a material impact on our future liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Nor can we predict the impact on the health of our employees, our supply chain or our ability to recover higher costs associated with managing an outbreak. 
 Operations could be impacted by war, terrorism or other events. 
 Our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities and information and control systems may be targets of terrorist activities. Any disruption could impact operations or result in a decrease in revenues and additional costs to repair and insure our assets. These disruptions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The potential for terrorism has subjected our operations to increased risks and could have a material effect on our business. We have incurred increased costs for security and capital expenditures in response to these risks. The insurance industry has also been affected by these events and the availability of insurance may decrease. In addition, insurance may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. 
 A disruption of the regional electric transmission grid, interstate natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources, could negatively impact our business, brand and reputation. Because our facilities are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the actions of a neighboring utility. 
 We also face the risks of possible loss of business due to significant events such as severe storms, temperature extremes, wildfires, widespread pandemic, generator or transmission facility outage, pipeline rupture, railroad disruption, operator error, sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation or a workforce disruption. 
 In addition, major catastrophic events throughout the world may disrupt our business. While we have business continuity plans in place, our ability to recover may be prolonged due to the type and extent of the event. NSP-Wisconsin participates in a global supply chain, which includes materials and components that are globally sourced. A prolonged disruption could result in the delay of equipment and materials that may impact our ability to connect, restore and reliably serve our customers. 
 A major disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues, additional costs to repair assets, and an adverse impact on the cost and availability of insurance, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

A cyber incident or security breach could have a material effect on our business. 
 We operate in an industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology, control systems and network infrastructure. In addition, we use our systems and infrastructure to create, collect, use, disclose, store, dispose of and otherwise process sensitive information, including Company data, customer energy usage data, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors and other individuals. 
 Our generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure or physical assets, as well as information processed in our systems (e.g., information regarding our customers, employees, operations, infrastructure and assets) could be affected by cyber security incidents, including those caused by human error. 
 The utility industry has been the target of several attacks on operational systems and has seen an increased volume and sophistication of cyber security incidents from international activist organizations, other countries and individuals. We expect to continue to experience attempts to compromise our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or results of operations. 
 Cyber security incidents could harm our businesses by limiting our generating, transmitting and distributing capabilities, delaying our development and construction of new facilities or capital improvement projects to existing facilities, disrupting our customer operations or causing the release of customer information, all of which would likely receive state and federal regulatory scrutiny and could expose us to liability. 
 Our generation, transmission systems and natural gas pipelines are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cyber security incident on the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers operations, could also negatively impact our business. 
 Our supply chain for procurement of digital equipment and services may expose software or hardware to these risks and could result in a breach or significant costs of remediation. We are unable to quantify the potential impact of cyber security threats or subsequent related actions. Cyber security incidents and regulatory action could result in a material decrease in revenues and may cause significant additional costs (e.g., penalties, third-party claims, repairs, insurance or compliance) and potentially disrupt our supply and markets for natural gas, oil and other fuels. 
 We maintain security measures to protect our information technology and control systems, network infrastructure and other assets. However, these assets and the information they process may be vulnerable to cyber security incidents, including asset failure or unauthorized access to assets or information. A failure or breach of our technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt critical business functions and may negatively impact our business, our brand, and our reputation. The cyber security threat is dynamic and evolves continually, and our efforts to prioritize network protection may not be effective given the constant changes to threat vulnerability. 
 While the Company maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damages experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.

 Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be adversely affected by milder weather. 
 Our electric and natural gas utility businesses are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand depends heavily upon weather patterns. A significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters and summers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 Public Policy Risks 
 Increased risks of regulatory penalties could negatively impact our business. 
 The Energy Act increased civil penalty authority for violation of FERC statutes, rules and orders. FERC can impose penalties of up to 1.5 million per violation per day, particularly as it relates to energy trading activities for both electricity and natural gas. In addition, NERC electric reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection requirements are mandatory and subject to potential financial penalties. Also, the PHMSA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to assess penalties. 
 In the event of serious incidents, these agencies may pursue penalties. In addition, certain states have the authority to impose substantial penalties. If a serious reliability, cyber or safety incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 The continued use of natural gas for both power generation and gas distribution have increasingly become a public policy advocacy target. These efforts may result in a limitation of natural gas as an energy source for both power generation and heating, which could impact our ability to reliably and affordably serve our customers. 
 In recent years, there have been various local and state agency proposals within and outside our service territories that would attempt to restrict the use and availability of natural gas. If such policies were to prevail, we may be forced to make new resource investment decisions which could potentially result in stranded costs if we are not able to fully recover costs and investments and impact the overall reliability of our service. 
 Environmental Policy Risks 
 We may be subject to legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, with which compliance could be difficult and costly. 
 Legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change may create financial risk as our facilities may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. International agreements could additionally lead to future federal or state regulations. 
 In 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reached consensus among 190 nations on an agreement (the Paris Agreement) that establishes a framework for GHG mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2 Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5 Celsius. 

International commitments and agreements could result in future additional GHG reductions in the United States. In addition, in 2023 the EPA intends to publish draft regulations for GHG emissions from the power sector consistent with the agency s Clean Air Act authorities. 
 Many states and localities continue to pursue their own climate policies. The steps Xcel Energy has taken to date to reduce GHG emissions, including energy efficiency measures, adding renewable generation and retiring or converting coal plants to natural gas, occurred under state-endorsed resource plans, renewable energy standards and other state policies. 
 We may be subject to climate change lawsuits. An adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. Defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. 
 If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O M costs incurred to comply with the mandates, it could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance could be difficult and costly. 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that affect many aspects of our operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and the generation, transport and disposal of solid wastes and hazardous substances. Laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, licenses, and approvals and to comply with a variety of environmental requirements. 
 Environmental laws and regulations can also require us to restrict or limit the output of facilities or the use of certain fuels, shift generation to lower-emitting facilities, install pollution control equipment, clean up spills and other contamination and correct environmental hazards. Failure to meet requirements of environmental mandates may result in fines or penalties. We may be required to pay all or a portion of the cost to remediate sites where our past activities, or the activities of other parties, caused environmental contamination. 
 Changes in environmental policies and regulations or regulatory decisions may result in early retirements of our generation facilities. While regulation typically provides relief for these types of changes, there is no assurance that regulators would allow full recovery of all remaining costs. 
 We are subject to mandates to provide customers with clean energy, renewable energy and energy conservation offerings. It could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if our regulators do not allow us to recover the cost of capital investment or O M costs incurred to comply with the requirements. 
 In addition, existing environmental laws or regulations may be revised and new laws or regulations may be adopted. We may also incur additional unanticipated obligations or liabilities under existing environmental laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather, natural disaster and resource depletion impacts. 
 Climate change can create physical and financial risk. Physical risks include changes in weather conditions and extreme weather events.

 Our customers energy needs vary with weather. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in generating assets, transmission and infrastructure. Decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. 
 Climate change may impact the economy, which could impact our sales and revenues. The price of energy has an impact on the economic health of our communities. The cost of additional regulatory requirements, such as regulation of GHG, could impact the availability of goods and prices charged by our suppliers, which would normally be borne by consumers through higher prices for energy and purchased goods. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions. 
 We establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving legal, regulatory, and other standards, processes, and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs, the availability of requisite financing, and changes in carbon markets. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation. 
 Severe weather impacts our service territories, primarily when thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes, wildfires and snow or ice storms or extreme temperatures (high heating/cooling days) occur. Extreme weather conditions in general require system backup and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise electricity prices, increasing the cost of energy we provide to our customers. 
 To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service and result in more frequent service interruptions. Periods of extreme temperatures could also impact our ability to meet demand. 
 More frequent and severe drought conditions, extreme swings in amount and timing of precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the potential impact of an event. Also, the expansion of the wildland urban interface increases the wildfire risk to surrounding communities and NSP-Wisconsin's electric and natural gas infrastructure. 
 Other potential risks associated with wildfires include the inability to secure sufficient insurance coverage, or increased costs of insurance, regulatory recovery risk, and the potential for a credit downgrade and subsequent additional costs to access capital markets. 
 While we carry liability insurance, given an extreme event, if NSP-Wisconsin was found to be liable for wildfire damages, amounts that potentially exceed our coverage could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Drought or water depletion could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers, cause early retirement of power plants and increase the cost for energy. Adverse events may result in increased insurance costs and/or decreased insurance availability. We may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.

 ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 NSP-Wisconsin is involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or is a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Management maintains accruals for losses probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation.

Table of Contents 

 Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably possible loss in certain situations, including but not limited to, when (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss. 
 For current proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, would have a material effect on NSP-Wisconsin s consolidated financial statements. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred.

 ITEM 6 [RESERVED] 

ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Discussion of financial condition and liquidity for NSP-Wisconsin is omitted per conditions set forth in General Instructions I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K for wholly owned subsidiaries. It is replaced with management s narrative analysis and the results of operations for the current year as set forth in General Instructions I(2)(a) of Form 10-K for wholly owned subsidiaries (reduced disclosure format). 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing earnings. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that are adjusted from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 

NSP-Wisconsin s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings) 
 Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items 
 We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of NSP-Minnesota s core earnings and underlying performance. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of NSP-Wisconsin. For the years ended Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no such adjustments to GAAP earnings and therefore GAAP earnings equal ongoing earnings. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 2022 Comparison with 2021 
 NSP-Wisconsin s net income was 125 million for 2022 compared with 108 million for 2021. The increase is due to regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation and O M expenses. 
 Electric Margin 
 Electric margin is presented as electric revenues less electric fuel and purchased power expenses. Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues. 
 Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium. However, these price fluctuations generally have minimal impact on earnings impact due to fuel recovery mechanisms. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for production tax credits generated, which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.

 Natural Gas Margin 
 Natural gas margin is presented as natural gas revenues less the cost of natural gas sold and transported. Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are generally offset in operating revenues. 
 Natural gas expense varies with changing sales and the cost of natural gas. However, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas generally have minimal earnings impact due to cost recovery mechanisms. 
 Natural Gas Revenues, Cost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported and Natural Gas Margin

 Changes in Natural Gas Margin 
 (Millions of Dollars) 2022 vs. 2021 Regulatory rate outcomes (Wisconsin) 11 Estimated impact of weather 5 Natural gas sales and transport (excluding weather impact) 1 Total increase 17 
 Non-Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items 
 O M Expenses O M expenses increased 25 million year-to-date. The increase was primarily due to technology and customer programs; operational activities (vegetation management, repairs/maintenance and storms); interchange; inflation and supply chain constraints; and other. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased 11 million for 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to capital investment. 
 Income Taxes Income tax expense increased 5 million for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher pretax earnings in 2022. 
 
 Public Utility Regulation 
 The FERC and various state and local regulatory commissions regulate NSP-Wisconsin. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of NSP-Wisconsin are approved by the FERC or the regulatory commissions in the states in which it operates. 
 Rates are designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. NSP-Wisconsin requests changes in utility rates through commission filings. 
 Changes in operating costs can affect NSP-Wisconsin s financial results, depending on the timing of rate case filings and implementation of final rates. Other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales, conservation and Demand Side Management efforts, and the cost of capital. 
 In addition, the regulatory commissions authorize the ROE, capital structure and depreciation rates in rate proceedings. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact NSP-Wisconsin s results of operations and credit quality. 
 See Rate Matters within Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 

Summary of Regulatory Agencies / RTO and Areas of Jurisdiction 
 Regulatory Body / RTO Additional Information 
 PSCW Retail rates, services and other aspects of electric and natural gas operations. 
 Certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines before the facilities may be sited and built. 
 The PSCW has a biennial base rate filing requirement. By June of each odd numbered year, NSP-Wisconsin must submit a rate filing for the test year beginning the following January. 
 Pipeline safety compliance. 
 MPSC Retail rates, services and other aspects of electric and natural gas operations. 
 Certifies the need for new generating plants and electric transmission lines before the facilities may be sited and built. 
 Pipeline safety compliance. 
 FERC Wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with NERC electric reliability standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce. 
 MISO NSP-Wisconsin is a transmission owning member of the MISO RTO that operates within the MISO RTO and wholesale energy market. NSP-Wisconsin and NSP-Minnesota are jointly authorized by the FERC to make wholesale electric sales at market-based prices. 
 DOT Pipeline safety compliance. 
 
 Recovery Mechanisms Mechanism Additional Information 
 Annual Fuel Cost Plan NSP-Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel adjustment clause. Under Wisconsin rules, utilities submit a forward-looking annual fuel cost plan to the PSCW. Once the PSCW approves the plan, utilities defer the amount of any fuel cost under-recovery or over-recovery in excess of a 2 annual tolerance band, for future rate recovery or refund. Approval of a fuel cost plan and any rate adjustment for refund or recovery of deferred costs is determined by the PSCW. Rate recovery of deferred fuel cost is subject to an earnings test based on the most recently authorized ROE. Under-collections that exceed the 2 annual tolerance band may not be recovered if the utility earnings for that year exceed the authorized ROE. 
 Power Supply Cost Recovery Factors NSP-Wisconsin s retail electric rate schedules for Michigan customers include power supply cost recovery factors, based on 12-month projections. After each 12-month period, a reconciliation is submitted whereby over-recoveries are refunded and any under-recoveries are collected from customers. 
 Wisconsin Energy Efficiency Program The primary energy efficiency program is funded by the utilities, but operated by independent contractors subject to oversight by the PSCW and utilities. NSP-Wisconsin recovers these costs from customers. 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment A retail cost-recovery mechanism to recover the actual cost of natural gas, transportation, and storage services. 
 Natural Gas Cost-Recovery Factor (MI) NSP-Wisconsin s natural gas rates for Michigan customers include a natural gas cost-recovery factor, based on 12-month projections and trued-up to actual amounts on an annual basis. 
 
 Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings 
 Michigan Natural Gas Rate Case In July 2022, NSP-Wisconsin filed an application with the MPSC seeking a revenue increase in base natural gas rates of 1 million for the period of 2023-2025. In October 2022, NSP-Wisconsin reached a settlement in principle with MPSC staff and various parties, granting a gas revenue increase of 0.7 million in 2023 and an incremental increase in 2024. The settlement is based on a capital structure of 9.8 ROE and 52.5 equity ratio. In December 2022, the MPSC approved the settlement with new rates effective January 1, 2023.

 Other 
 Supply Chain 
 NSP-Wisconsin s ability to meet customer energy requirements, respond to storm-related disruptions and execute our capital expenditure program are dependent on maintaining an efficient supply chain. Manufacturing processes have experienced disruptions related to scarcity of certain raw materials and interruptions in production and shipping. These disruptions have been further exacerbated by inflationary pressures, labor shortages and the impact of international conflicts/issues. NSP-Wisconsin continues to monitor the situation as it remains fluid and seeks to mitigate the impacts by securing alternative suppliers, modifying design standards, and adjusting the timing of work. 
 Electric Distribution and Transmission Transformers 
 The availability of certain transformers is an industry-wide issue that has been significantly impacted and in some cases may result in delays in projects and new customer connections. NSP-Wisconsin continues to seek alternative suppliers and prioritize work plans to mitigate impacts of supply constraints. 
 Solar Resources 
 In June 2021, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin's Western Mustang solar project, a 74 megawatt facility that would be built by a developer for approximately 100 million. The project was originally scheduled to go into service in 2022. As a result of the disruption of the solar supply chain, the developer has indicated difficulty delivering the project at the contract price and scheduled in-service date. 
 In December 2022, NSP-Wisconsin notified the PSCW that the Company will not proceed with the purchase of the Western Mustang solar generating facility. NSP-Wisconsin noted in the letter to the Commission that it remains committed to advancing solar in Wisconsin and pursuing incremental solar generation from other developers. 
 MISO Capacity Credits The NSP System offered 1,500 MW of excess capacity into the MISO planning resource auction for June 2022 through May 2023. Due to a projected overall capacity shortfall in the MISO region, the 1,500 MWs offered cleared the auction at maximum pricing, generating revenues of approximately 90 million in 2022, with approximately 60 million expected in 2023. 
 NSP-Wisconsin's share of the 2022 capacity revenues was approximately 15 million. These revenues offset fuel costs through existing fuel recovery mechanisms. 
 Inflation Reduction Act In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. 
 Key provisions impacting NSP-Wisconsin include: 
 Extends current PTC and ITC for renewable technologies (e.g., wind and solar). 
 Restores full value of the PTC and ITC for qualifying facilities placed in-service after 2021. 
 Creates PTC for solar, clean hydrogen and nuclear. 
 Establishes an ITC for energy storage, microgrids, interconnection facilities, etc. 
 Allows companies to monetize or sell credits to unrelated parties. 

NSP-Wisconsin anticipates the IRA will drive significant customer savings for both new and existing Company owned renewable projects, assuming appropriate regulatory mechanisms and development of a market for the sale of tax credits. The IRA is expected to allow NSP-Wisconsin to monetize tax credits more efficiently with the incremental benefits passed through to customers. 
 The IRA creates a nuclear PTC beginning in 2024 that may also provide additional savings to NSP System customers, depending on locational marginal pricing, as well as constructive U.S. Treasury guidance regarding computation of the credits. 
 In addition, the IRA created a new corporate AMT. NSP-Wisconsin does not anticipate AMT having a material cash impact based on current estimates and our interpretation of AMT application. 
 
 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk 
 NSP-Wisconsin is exposed to a variety of market risks in the normal course of business. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of adverse changes in the market or fair value for a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. 
 NSP-Wisconsin is exposed to the impact of adverse changes in price for energy and energy-related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. While NSP-Wisconsin expects that the counterparties will perform on the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose NSP-Wisconsin to credit and non-performance risk. 
 Distress in the financial markets may impact counterparty risk and the fair value of the securities in the pension fund. 
 Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk in our electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long and short-term physical purchase and sales contracts for natural gas used in distribution activities. 
 Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our risk management policy allows us to manage commodity price risk within each rate-regulated operation per commission approved hedge plans. 
 Interest Rate Risk NSP-Wisconsin is subject to interest rate risk. NSP-Wisconsin s risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. 
 A 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on NSP-Wisconsin s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense annually by an immaterial amount and approximately 1 million in Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

18 

Table of Contents 

 The value of pension and postretirement plan assets and benefit costs are impacted by changes in discount rates and expected return on plan assets. NSP-Wisconsin s ongoing pension and postretirement investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to optimize potential investment risk and minimize interest rate risk associated with changes in the obligations as a plan s funded status increases over time. The impacts of fluctuations in interest rates on pension and postretirement costs are mitigated by pension cost calculation methodologies and regulatory mechanisms that minimize the earnings impacts of such changes. 
 Credit Risk NSP-Wisconsin is also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties nonperformance on their contractual obligations. NSP-Wisconsin maintains credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitors these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. 
 At Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, a 10 increase or decrease in commodity prices would have an immaterial impact on credit exposure. 

NSP-Wisconsin conducts credit reviews for all wholesale, trading and non-trading commodity counterparties and employs credit risk controls, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, master netting agreements and termination provisions. Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase NSP-Wisconsin credit risk. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Derivative contracts, with the exception of those designated as normal purchases and normal sales, are reported at fair value. NSP-Wisconsin s pension and other postretirement funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

 Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of NSP-Wisconsin is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. NSP-Wisconsin s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Xcel Energy Inc. s and NSP-Wisconsin s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 NSP-Wisconsin management assessed the effectiveness of NSP-Wisconsin s internal control over financial reporting as of Dec. 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of Dec. 31, 2022, NSP-Wisconsin s internal control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholder and the Board of Directors of Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements . 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company is subject to rate regulation by state utility regulatory agencies, which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin and Michigan. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its wholesale electric operations, hydroelectric generation licensing, accounting practices, wholesale sales for resale, transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation standards, asset transactions and mergers and natural gas transactions in interstate commerce, (collectively with state utility regulatory agencies, the Commissions ). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, including property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and expenses, and income taxes. 
 The Company is subject to regulatory rate setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company s investment in assets required to deliver services to customers. Accounting for the Company s regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The Commissions regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. In the rate setting process, the Company s rates result in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because future recovery from customers is probable. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, and 3) a refund due to customers. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural schedules and memorandums, filings made by intervenors, experts testimony and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. If the full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management s assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We evaluated the external information and compared to the Company s recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness. 
 We obtained management s analysis and correspondence from counsel, as appropriate, regarding regulatory assets or liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

 Credit Facility In order to use commercial paper programs to fulfill short-term funding needs, NSP-Wisconsin must have revolving credit facilities in place at least equal to the amount of their respective commercial paper borrowing limits and cannot issue commercial paper exceeding available capacity under these credit facilities. 
 The lines of credit provide short-term financing in the form of notes payable to banks, letters of credit and back-up support for commercial paper borrowings. 
 Features of the credit facility: 
 N/A

 Long-Term Borrowings and Other Financing Instruments 
 Generally, the property of NSP-Wisconsin is subject to the lien of its first mortgage indenture for the benefit of bondholders. Debt premiums, discounts and expenses are amortized over the life of the related debt. The premiums, discounts and expenses for refinanced debt are deferred and amortized over the life of new issuance.

 Other Income Tax Matters 
 State NOL carryforward 
 Federal carryforward periods expire between 2032 and 2042 and state carryforward periods expire between 2031 and 2036. 
 Federal Tax Loss Carryback Claims In 2020, Xcel Energy identified certain expenses related to tax years 2009 - 2011 that qualify for an extended carryback claim. NSP-Wisconsin is not expected to accrue any income tax expense related to this adjustment. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 Federal Audit 
 
 Additionally, the statute of limitations related to certain federal tax credit carryforwards will remain open until those credits are utilized in subsequent returns. Further, the statute of limitations related to the additional federal tax loss carryback claim filed in 2020 has been extended. Xcel Energy has recognized its best estimate of income tax expense that will result from a final resolution of this issue; however, the outcome and timing of a resolution is unknown. 
 State Audits NSP-Wisconsin is a member of the Xcel Energy affiliated group that files consolidated state income tax returns. As of Dec. 31, 2022, NSP-Wisconsin s earliest open tax years that are subject to examination by state taxing authorities under applicable statutes of limitations are as follows: 
 State Tax Year(s) Expiration Wisconsin 2016-2017 April 2023 Wisconsin 2018 October 2023 
 In 2021, Wisconsin began an audit of tax years 2016-2019. As of Dec. 31, 2022 material adjustments have been proposed. 
 Unrecognized tax benefit balance includes permanent tax positions, which if recognized would affect the ETR. In addition, the unrecognized tax benefit balance includes temporary tax positions for which deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing. A change in the timing of deductibility would not affect the ETR but would accelerate the payment to the taxing authority.

 Fair value of NSP-Wisconsin s long-term debt is estimated based on recent trades and observable spreads from benchmark interest rates for similar securities. Fair value estimates are based on information available to management as of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, and given the observability of the inputs, fair values presented for long-term debt were assigned as Level 2. 
 
 , and percent in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Some employees may participate under legacy formulas such as the traditional final average pay or pension equity. Xcel Energy s policy is to fully fund into an external trust the actuarially determined pension costs subject to the limitations of applicable employee benefit and tax laws. 
 In addition to the qualified pension plans, Xcel Energy maintains a SERP and a nonqualified pension plan. The SERP is maintained for certain executives who participated in the plan in 2008, when the SERP was closed to new participants. The nonqualified pension plan provides benefits for compensation that is in excess of the limits applicable to the qualified pension plans, with distributions funded by Xcel Energy s consolidated operating cash flows. Obligations of the SERP and nonqualified plan as of Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021 were million and million, respectively, of which the amounts attributable to NSP-Wisconsin were immaterial in both years. Xcel Energy recognized net benefit cost for the SERP and nonqualified plans of million and million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which amounts attributable to NSP-Wisconsin were immaterial. 

. 
 Investment returns in 2021 were above the assumed level of . 
 Investment returns in 2020 were above the assumed level of . 
 In 2023, NSP-Wisconsin s expected investment-return assumption is . 
 Pension plan and postretirement benefit assets are invested in a portfolio according to Xcel Energy s return, liquidity and diversification objectives to provide a source of funding for plan obligations and minimize contributions to the plan, within appropriate levels of risk. 
 The principal mechanism for achieving these objectives is the asset allocation given the long-term risk, return, correlation and liquidity characteristics of each particular asset class. 
 There were no significant concentrations of risk in any industry, index, or entity. Market volatility can impact even well-diversified portfolios and significantly affect the return levels achieved by the assets in any year. 
 Xcel Energy s ongoing investment strategy is based on plan-specific investment recommendations that seek to minimize potential investment and interest rate risk as a plan s funded status increases over time. 
 The investment recommendations consider many factors and generally result in a greater percentage of long-duration fixed income securities being allocated to specific plans having relatively higher funded status ratios and a greater percentage of growth assets being allocated to plans having relatively lower funded status ratios.

 Defined Contribution Plans 
 Xcel Energy, which includes NSP-Wisconsin, maintains 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that cover most employees. The expense to these plans for NSP-Wisconsin was approximately million in 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Multiemployer Plans 
 NSP-Wisconsin contributes to several union multiemployer pension plans, none of which are individually significant. These plans provide pension benefits to certain union employees who may perform services for multiple employers and do not participate in the NSP-Wisconsin sponsored pension plans. Contributing to these types of plans creates risk that differs from providing benefits under NSP-Wisconsin sponsored plans, in that if another participating employer ceases to contribute to a multiemployer plan, additional unfunded obligations may need to be funded over time by remaining participating employers. 
 
 10. Commitments and Contingencies 

In November 2013 and February 2015, customer groups filed two ROE complaints against MISO TOs, which includes NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin. The first complaint requested a reduction in base ROE transmission formula rates from to for the time period of Nov. 12, 2013 to Feb. 11, 2015, and removal of ROE adders (including those for RTO membership). The second complaint requested, for a subsequent time period, a base ROE reduction from to . 
 The FERC subsequently issued various related orders (including Opinion Nos. 569, 569A and 569B) related to ROE methodology/calculations and timing. NSP-Minnesota has processed refunds to customers for applicable complaint periods based on the ROE in the most recent applicable opinions. 
 The MISO TOs and various other parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC s most recent applicable opinions at the D.C. Circuit. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit ruled that FERC had not adequately supported its conclusions, vacated FERC s related orders and remanded the issue back to FERC for further proceedings, which remain pending. Additional exposure, if any related to this matter is expected to be immaterial.

 NSP-Wisconsin has recognized its best estimate of costs/liabilities from final resolution of these issues; however, the outcome and timing are unknown. In addition, there may be insurance recovery and/or recovery from other potentially responsible parties, offsetting a portion of costs incurred. 
 Environmental Requirements Water and Waste 
 Federal Clean Water Act Section 316(b) The Federal Clean Water Act requires the EPA to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure they reflect the best technology available for minimizing impingement and entrainment of aquatic species. NSP-Wisconsin estimates capital expenditures of approximately million may be required to comply with the requirements. NSP-Wisconsin believes two plants could be required to make improvements to reduce impingement and entrainment.

companies, called the Interchange Agreement, provides for the sharing of all costs of generation and transmission facilities of the system, including capital costs. Such costs include current and potential obligations of NSP-Minnesota related to its nuclear generating facilities. 
 NSP-Minnesota s public liability for claims from any nuclear incident is limited to billion under the Price-Anderson amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. NSP-Minnesota has secured million of coverage for its public liability exposure with a pool of insurance companies. The remaining billion of exposure is funded by the Secondary Financial Protection Program available from assessments by the federal government. 
 NSP-Minnesota is subject to assessments of up to million per reactor-incident for each of its reactors, for public liability arising from a nuclear incident at any licensed nuclear facility in the United States. The maximum funding requirement is million per reactor-incident during any one year. Maximum assessments are subject to inflation adjustments by the NRC. 
 NSP-Minnesota purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from NEIL and EMANI. The coverage limits are billion for each of NSP-Minnesota s nuclear plant sites. NEIL also provides business interruption insurance coverage up to million, including the cost of replacement power during prolonged accidental outages of nuclear generating units. Premiums are expensed over the policy term. 
 All companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive premium adjustments if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds. Capital has been accumulated in the reserve funds of NEIL and EMANI to the extent that NSP-Minnesota would have no exposure for retroactive premium assessments in case of a single incident under the business interruption and the property damage insurance coverage. NSP-Minnesota could be subject to annual maximum assessments of million for business interruption insurance and million for property damage insurance if losses exceed accumulated reserve funds.

 ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 NSP-Wisconsin maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of Dec. 31, 2022, based on an evaluation carried out under the supervision and with the participation of NSP-Wisconsin s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, the CEO and CFO have concluded that NSP-Wisconsin s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in NSP-Wisconsin s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NSP-Wisconsin s internal control over financial reporting. NSP-Wisconsin maintains internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting. NSP-Wisconsin has evaluated and documented its controls in process activities, general computer activities, and on an entity-wide level. 

During the year and in preparation for issuing its report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2022 on internal controls under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, NSP-Wisconsin conducted testing and monitoring of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the control evaluation, testing and remediation performed, NSP-Wisconsin did not identify any material control weaknesses, as defined under the standards and rules issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as approved by the SEC and as indicated in NSP-Wisconsin s Management Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, which is contained in Item 8 herein. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of NSP-Wisconsin s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
