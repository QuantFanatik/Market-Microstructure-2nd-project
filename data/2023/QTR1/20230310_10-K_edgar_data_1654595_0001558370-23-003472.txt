 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the 1995 Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that we intend to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the 1995 Act. We have used the words approximately, anticipate, assume, believe, budget, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, future, intend, may, outlook, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: the competitive environment in which we operate; 
 failure of our recently announced exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value or to result in a transaction that yields value to our stockholders, and the potential that our exploration of strategic alternatives could adversely impact us; 
 local, regional, national and international economic conditions; capital expenditures; the availability, terms and deployment of capital; financing risks; inflation; the general level of interest rates; changes in our business or strategy; fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs; our limited operating history; the degree and nature of our competition; our dependence upon our Manager and key personnel; defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants; decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates; our ability to make distributions on shares of our common stock; difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions; our ability to operate as a public company;

 potential natural disasters such as hurricanes; the impact of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus (such as COVID-19 and its variants); our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 
 our ability to maintain an active trading market for our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq and maintain continued listing on Nasdaq and the likelihood that a delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell our common stock; 
 potential changes in the law or governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations of those laws and regulations, including changes in real estate and zoning or tax laws, and potential increases in real property tax rates; and related industry developments, including trends affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report are based on historical performance and management s current plans, estimates and expectations in light of information currently available to us and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to the factors, risks and uncertainties described above, changes in global, regional or local political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary in material respects from what we may have expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. We caution that you should not place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Annual Report speaks only as of the date of this Annual Report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.

 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS As used in this Annual Report, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, our, us, and our company refer to Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Medalist Diversified Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner, except where it is clear from the context that the term only means Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc. Overview Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc. was formed in 2015 as a Maryland corporation, to acquire, reposition, renovate, lease and manage income-producing properties, with a primary focus on (i) commercial properties, including flex-industrial and retail properties, (ii) multi-family residential properties and (iii) hotel properties. We invest primarily in properties across secondary and tertiary markets in the southeastern part of the United States, with a concentration in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Alabama. Beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that we have operated in a manner qualifying us as a REIT, and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and advised by Medalist Fund Manager, Inc., a Virginia corporation, or our Manager. Our Manager makes all investment decisions for us. Our Manager is owned 50 each by Mr. William R. Elliott and Mr. Thomas E. Messier, who are co-Presidents thereof. We operate as an UPREIT, and own our properties through our subsidiary, Medalist Diversified Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. We may also pursue other real estate-related investments, including but not limited to equity or other ownership interests in entities that are the direct or indirect owners of real property, or indirect investments in real property, such as those that may be obtained in a joint venture. We anticipate that any such equity or joint venture investments to be in controlling interests in such entities. While we do not intend for these types of investments to be a primary focus, we may make such investments in our Manager s sole discretion. We refer to our investments in real property and our real estate-related investments, collectively, as Investments. Our principal objectives include sourcing value-add Investments in markets in which we maintain deep industry relationships and local market knowledge, and the creation of value for stockholders by utilizing our relationships and local knowledge of commercial real estate investment, management and disposition. We may make Investments in properties owned by unaffiliated third parties, our Manager, or affiliates of our Manager, as determined by our Manager in its sole discretion. There is, however, no assurance that any of these objectives will be achieved. On March 10, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors formed a special committee of independent directors to explore potential strategic alternatives to maximize value for our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction or any other particular outcome. The exploration of strategic alternatives could result in the diversion of management s attention from our existing business; failure to achieve financial or operating objectives; incurrence of significant transaction expenses; failure to retain, attract or strengthen our relationships with tenants and other key business partners; and exposure to potential litigation in connection with this process and effecting any transaction or strategic alternative. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by our exploration of strategic alternatives, it may disrupt our business or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Management Our Manager and its affiliated companies specialize in acquiring, developing, owning and managing value-added commercial real estate in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. Through their prior experience in the real estate industry, our Manager s principals and their respective affiliates have developed a strong network of relationships with real estate owners, investors, operators and developers of all sizes and investment formats, across the United States and have a track record of success. We intend to leverage this experience to gain access to and identify suitable Investments, located across secondary and tertiary markets throughout the southeastern part of the United States, primarily in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Alabama. We do not anticipate making Investments outside of the United States.

 The principal executive offices of our company and our Manager are located at 1051 E. Cary Street, Suite 601, James Center Three, Richmond, Virginia 23219. Our telephone number is (804) 344-4445. Investment Strategies Our Manager believes that its focus on value-add and opportunistic commercial real estate provides an attractive balance of risk and returns. Our Manager intends to use some or all of the following strategies to enhance the performance, quality and value of our Investments: proprietary investment sourcing; a rigorous, consistent and replicable process for sourcing and conducting due diligence; appropriate exit strategy; hands-on portfolio management; and focus on opportunistic properties. 
 Our investment policies provide our Manager with substantial discretion with respect to the selection, purchase and sale of specific Investments, subject to the limitations in the Management Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2016, among us, our operating partnership and our Manager (as amended by a Letter Agreement, dated March 19, 2021, and as further amended by a Letter Agreement, dated as of March 10, 2023), the Management Agreement ). See Item 9B Other Information. We may revise the investment policies without the approval of our stockholders. We review the investment policies at least annually to determine whether the policies continue to be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our Portfolio Our goal is to acquire and own, through wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, a portfolio of commercial, retail and hotel properties located primarily in the southeastern United States. We currently own eight Investments comprised of five retail properties and three flex/industrial properties. We own 100 of the interests in our Investments, except for one flex/industrial property of which we own 82 tenant-in-common interest in the property and one retail property of which we own 84 tenant-in-common interest in the property. For further information on properties and our tenant base, see Item 2 Properties. Reporting Segments We establish operating segments at the property level and aggregate individual properties into reportable segments based on product types in which we have Investments. As of December 31, 2022, we had the following reportable segments: retail center properties, flex center properties and hotel properties. Although we sold our interest in the Clemson Best Western Hotel Property on September 29, 2022, we continue to include hotel properties as a third reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Competition We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. We also face competition from other real estate investment programs, for investments that may be suitable for us. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may have substantially more operating experience than either us or our Manager. They also may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.

 Environmental Matters As the owner of the buildings on our properties, we could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in our buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if we do not comply with such laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, we could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in our buildings, and we could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in our buildings. In addition, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant s ability to make rental payments to us, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations. We are not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or environmental matters that may exist. Staffing We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. We do not have any employees and our executive officers are employed by our Manager or other third party firms. Certain of our other officers and our senior accountant are employed by Gunston Consulting, LLC Consultant ), which provides certain financial and accounting services to us pursuant to a Consulting Agreement, effective as of March 1, 2020 (as amended, the Consulting Agreement ), between us and Consultant. Our properties are managed by third party property management companies with whom our Manager contracts. Available Information We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports with the SEC.

Access to these filings is free of charge. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We have omitted a discussion of risk factors because, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide such information. IT EM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

 Hanover Square Property On May 8, 2018, we acquired an undivided 84 tenant-in-common interest in the Shops at the Hanover Square Property from COF North, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company and unaffiliated seller. The property is comprised of (i) an approximately 73,441 square foot retail center located on 8.766 acres of land at 7230 Bell Creek Road in Mechanicsville, Virginia 23111 and (ii) a contiguous, undeveloped parcel of land totaling 0.864 acres. We refer to both parcels herein as the Hanover Square Property. The contract purchase price for the Hanover Square Property was 12,173,000. We acquired the Hanover Square Property with 3,291,404 in cash from us, 648,120 in cash from an unaffiliated tenant-in-common, and the assumption of a secured loan of approximately 8,527,315 from Langley Federal Credit Union, which amount was increased by an additional 372,685, or the Hanover Square Property Loan.

On December 31, 2022, we had approximately 12,335 holders of record of our common stock.

We generally intend to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our common stock, subject to our Board s discretion and applicable law. The actual amount and timing of dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our financial condition in addition to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ), and no assurance can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions, if any. From time to time, our Board may approve the repurchase of our shares of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share, through open market purchases or otherwise.

The Staff s determination was based on (i) our meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and (ii) our written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If at any time during the Second Compliance Period, the closing bid price of our common stock is at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation of compliance. If compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement cannot be demonstrated by July 10, 2023, the Staff will provide written notification that our common stock will be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the Staff s determination to a Hearings Panel. Neither the Deficiency Letter or the Second Notification had any effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MDRR . We intend to continue to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, including initiating a reverse stock split.

Under this agreement, our interest rate exposure is capped at 5.25 if USD 1-Month ICE LIBOR exceeds 3 . For the period from September 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, the effective rate for the Parkway Property mortgage exceeded the 5.25 cap, and payments from the Interest Rate Protection Transaction resulted in a net interest expense based on the 5.25 cap rate. Payments to our company from the Interest Rate Protection Transaction are recorded as an offset to interest expense on our company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. No such payments were received during the year ended December 31, 2021 because the interest rate in effect did not exceed the interest rate cap.

 COVID-19 Impact The following discussion is intended to provide certain information regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company s business and management s efforts to respond to those impacts. Since March 2020, our company s investment properties have been significantly impacted by (i) measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders and (ii) significant changes in consumer behavior and business and leisure travel patterns. While most of the measures have been relaxed by the respective governmental authorities, with the uncertainty resulting from the continued mutation of COVID-19 into new variants and the possibility of the re-imposition of mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders by some governmental authorities, and the possibility that changes in consumer behavior and business and leisure travel patterns will continue, the negative impact on room demand for our hotel properties, if any, and consumer demand for the goods and services of our retail tenants within our portfolio could continue to be significant in future periods. Retail Center and Flex Center Properties As of the date of this Annual Report, all of the tenants in our company s retail properties and flex properties are open. As is the case with retail landlords across the U.S., our company received a number of rent relief requests from tenants which were impacted by mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders and significant changes in consumer behavior. Our company evaluated each of these requests on a case-by-case basis. During the period following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2020 through December 2020, our company granted lease concessions in the form of (i) rent deferrals or (ii) rent abatements. The deferral and abatement agreements have reduced the rent revenues our company has recognized in all subsequent periods, including during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and are expected to reduce the rent revenues our company expects to receive in future periods. Under the rent deferral agreements, all of which were reached during the year ended December 31, 2020, our company granted rent deferrals to various tenants in return for an agreement by the tenants to repay deferred and unpaid rent over a specified time period or before a certain date. Deferred rent is recognized as retail center property revenues or flex center property revenues on our company s consolidated statement of operations and as rent and other receivables on our company s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, all rent deferral periods have ended and, in all cases, tenants have commenced repayment of the deferred rent amounts. As of the date of this Annual Report, all tenants are current on their deferred rent repayment. Under the rent abatement agreements, all of which were reached during the year ended December 31, 2020, our company agreed to permanently abate rent in exchange for lease extensions of between one and three years, depending on the amount of the abatement. In one case, our company agreed to abate a portion of a tenant s base rent in exchange for future rent payments based on the tenant s monthly sales. While our company s rent collections from our retail and flex center properties have stabilized, the extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 and its new variants on revenues from our company s retail and flex center properties and tenants remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the continued efficacy of vaccines against new variants, development and deployment of treatments, and potential mutations of COVID-19 and the response thereto. Revenues will continue to be impacted by the abatement agreements that our company has granted to various tenants and could continue to be negatively impacted until consumer demand for the goods and services of our company s retail and flex center tenants returns to levels prior to the virus outbreak. Additionally, the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures and the potential for changes in consumer behavior and business and leisure travel patterns could continue to have a significant negative impact on consumer demand for the goods and services of our company s retail tenants within its portfolio in the coming months.

 Hotel Properties Beginning in March 2020, COVID-19 caused widespread cancellations of both business and leisure travel throughout the United States, resulting in significant decreases in our company s revenues from the Hampton Inn Property (which our company sold on August 31, 2021) and the Clemson Best Western Property (which our company sold on September 29, 2022), and the hospitality industry as a whole. During our company s ownership of these properties, both were specifically subject to significant decreases in occupancy and revenues due to the impact of COVID-19 on business and leisure travel and generally subject to seasonal variations in occupancy and revenues. Despite our company s decision to sell our hotel properties, we have not removed hotel properties from our investment policy and will consider future opportunistic acquisitions of hotel properties in the future. Accordingly, should we make future investments in hotel properties, these investments could be subject to material impacts on occupancy and revenues from possible future outbreaks of COVID-19 and seasonality fluctuations in occupancy and revenues. Discussion of Potential Future Impact While most of the containment measures have been relaxed by the respective governmental authorities, with the uncertainty resulting from new variants of COVID-19 and the possibilities of the re-imposition of mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders by some governmental authorities, the negative impact on consumer demand for the goods and services of our retail and flex tenants within our portfolio could continue to be significant in the coming months. Our company derives revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under leases at our company s properties. Our company s operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of its tenants to make required rental payments. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the businesses of our company s tenants, and our company s operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and such containment measures, among others. While the extent of the outbreak and its impact on our company, its tenants and the U.S. retail market is uncertain, a prolonged crisis could result in continued disruptions in the credit and financial markets, a continued rise in unemployment rates, decreases in consumer confidence and consumer spending levels and an overall worsening of global and U.S. economic conditions. The factors described above, as well as additional factors that our company may not currently be aware of, could materially negatively impact our company s ability to collect rent and could lead to termination of leases by tenants, tenant bankruptcies, decreases in demand for retail space at our company s properties, difficulties in accessing capital, impairment of our company s long-lived assets and other impacts that could materially and adversely affect our company s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to stockholders. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition. Revenue Recognition Principal components of our total revenues for our retail center properties and flex center properties include base rents and tenant reimbursements. We accrue minimum (base) rent on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent) which we recognize when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. We periodically review the valuation of the asset/liability resulting from the straight-line accounting treatment of our leases in light of any changes in lease terms, financial condition or other factors concerning our tenants. For the periods during which our company owned its hotel properties, revenues were recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel s services. Revenues from our company s occupancy agreement with Clemson University were recognized as earned, which is as rooms were occupied by the University. Rents and Other Tenant Receivables For our retail center and flex center properties, we record a tenant receivable for amounts due from tenants such as base rents, tenant reimbursements and other charges allowed under the lease terms. We periodically review tenant receivables for collectability and determine the need for an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and other accounts receivable based upon customer creditworthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. We consider a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other actions per the lease. Accounting for Leases Our company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach within ASU 2018-11, which allows for the application date to be the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new standard. Our company historically has not been and is not currently a lessee under any lease agreements, and thus did not have any arrangements requiring the recognition of lease assets or liabilities on its balance sheet. As a lessor , our company has active lease agreements with over 100 tenants across our portfolio of investment properties. Upon the adoption of ASC No. 842, our company has elected the practical expedient permitting lessors to elect by class of underlying asset to not separate non-lease components (for example, maintenance services, including common area maintenance) from associated lease components (the non-separation practical expedient if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and non-lease component(s) are the same and (2) the lease component would be classified as an operating lease if it were accounted for separately. If both criteria are met, the combined component is accounted for in accordance with ASC No. 842 if the lease component is the predominant component of the combined component; otherwise, the combined component is accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition standard. Our company assessed the criteria above with respect to our operating leases and determined that they qualify for the non-separation practical expedient. As a result, we have accounted for and presented the revenues from these leases, including tenant reimbursements, as a single line item on our consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2022. For comparability, we have adjusted our comparative consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, to conform to the 2022 financial statement presentation. Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate The adoption of ASU 2017-01, as discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements included in this report, has impacted our accounting framework for the acquisition of investment properties. Upon acquisition of investment properties, our company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment) and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including in-place leases, above- and below-market leases, tenant relationships and assumed debt based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Fair values for these assets are not directly observable and estimates are based on comparable market data and other information which is subjective in nature, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We periodically review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property s cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. If any such events or changes in circumstances 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 are identified, we perform a formal impairment analysis. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. Our company also reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its intangible assets may not be recoverable, but at least annually. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 2017 and have not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90 of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100 of our taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate. Evaluation of our company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern Under the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, our company is required to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether or not the entity s current financial condition, including its sources of liquidity at the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued, will enable the entity to meet its obligations as they come due arising within one year of the date of the issuance of our company s consolidated financial statements and to make a determination as to whether or not it is probable, under the application of this accounting guidance, that the entity will be able to continue as a going concern. Our company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In applying applicable accounting guidance, management considered our company s current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our company s obligations due over the next twelve months, as well as our company s recurring business operating expenses. We have concluded that it is probable that we will be able to meet our obligations arising within one year of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements within the parameters set forth in the accounting guidance. For additional information regarding our company s liquidity, see Note 5 Loans Payable and Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our company s consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business model is intended to drive growth through acquisitions. Access to the capital markets is an important factor for our continued growth and success. Our primary liquidity needs are funding for (1) operations, including operating expenses, corporate and administrative costs, payment of principal of, and interest on, outstanding indebtedness, and escrow and reserve payments associated with long-term debt financing for our properties; (2) investing needs, including property acquisitions and recurring capital expenditures; and (3) financing needs, including cash dividends and debt repayments. Internal liquidity to fund operating needs are expected to be provided primarily by the rental receipts from our retail properties and flex center property. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our financial and operational results that provide the liquidity for operating needs. Our company s retail property and flex property rent revenues continued to be impacted by rent abatement agreements and other concessions. However, our Clemson Best Western Property saw increased revenues resulting from the occupancy agreement with Clemson University, which ended on May 15, 2022. During the transitional period between the end of this occupancy agreement and the reopening of normal hotel operations on June 24, 2022, the Clemson Best Western Property s revenues were significantly impacted while marketing and sales efforts resulted in increased demand and revenues and hotel operations returned to normal. Our company sold the Clemson Best Western Property on September 29, 2022. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company s liquidity will be dictated by, among other things, its nature, duration and scope, the success of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and the impact of actions taken in response to 
 31

 the pandemic including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, the promotion of social distancing and limitations on business activity, including business closures. New variants of COVID-19, including the omicron variant and sub-variants, and continued resistance to vaccination could result in the re-imposition of limitations on business activity, travel and other restrictions that could increase the extent of the impact on our investment properties. Possible future declines in rental rates and expectations of future rental concessions, including granting free rent to induce tenants to renew their leases early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal, or to attract new tenants, or requests from tenants for rent abatements during periods when they are severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in decreases in our cash flows from our retail and flex properties. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the economy and our business is uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and internal liquidity in the future. Cash Flows At December 31, 2022, our consolidated cash and restricted cash on hand totaled 5,662,853 compared to consolidated cash on hand of 7,383,977 at December 31, 2021. Cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2022 our cash provided by operating activities was 1,194,626 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 832,613 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of cash provided by operating activities of 362,013. Cash flows from operating activities has two components. The first component consists of net operating loss adjusted for non-cash operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, operating activities adjusted for non-cash items resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of 1,631,040. During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities adjusted for non-cash items resulted in net cash provided in operating activities of 1,040,512. The increase of 590,528 in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a result of improved operating performance across all property types, as well as cash flows from our company s acquisition of the Lancer Center Property, which was acquired on May 14, 2021, the Greenbrier Business Center Property, which was acquired on August 27, 2021, the Parkway Property, which was acquired on November 1, 2021, and the Salisbury Marketplace Property, which was acquired on June 13, 2022. The second component consists of changes in assets and liabilities. Increases in assets and decreases in liabilities result in cash used in operations. Decreases in assets and increases in liabilities result in cash provided by operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net changes in asset and liability accounts resulted in 436,414 in cash used operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net changes in asset and liability accounts resulted in 207,899 in cash used operations.

Future Liquidity Needs Liquidity for general operating needs and our company s investment properties is generally provided by the rental receipts from our retail properties and flex center property, and revenues from our hotel properties, if any. We expect to provide any liquidity for growth (acquisition of new investment properties) by raising additional investment capital. In addition, our company continually reviews and evaluates its outstanding mortgages payable for refinancing opportunities. While some of our mortgages payable are not pre-payable, some mortgages payable may present opportunities for refinancing. The primary, non-operating liquidity need of our company is 176,810 to pay the dividends and distributions to common shareholders and operating partnership unit holders, and 100,000 to pay the dividends to holders of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that were declared on January 10, 2023 and payable January 27, 2023 to holders of record on January 24, 2023, and 1,100,597 in principal payments due on its mortgages payable during the 12-month period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. In addition to liquidity required to fund these principal payments, we may also incur some level of capital expenditures for our existing properties that cannot be passed on to our tenants. Our company plans to pay these obligations through a combination of cash on hand, potential dispositions and operating cash. As discussed above, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has adversely impacted states and cities where our company s tenants operate their businesses and where our company s properties are located. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as the reduced economic activity

 severely impacts certain of our company s tenants businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause certain tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to our company in full. Closures of stores operated by our company s tenants could reduce our company s cash flows. To meet these future liquidity needs, we have the following resources: 3,922,136 in unrestricted cash as of December 31, 2022 1,740,717 held in lender reserves for the purposes of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, real estate taxes and insurance premiums cash generated from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, if any; and Potential proceeds from issuances of common stock under our shelf registration or under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements), although there is no guarantee that any such issuances will be successful in raising additional funds.

 Funds from Operations We use funds from operations FFO ), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by NAREIT, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs and above and below market leases) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results. NAREIT s December 2018 White Paper states, FFO of a REIT includes the FFO of all consolidated properties, including consolidated, partially owned affiliates . Additionally, since the adjustments to GAAP net income, such as depreciation and amortization, used in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to determine FFO are not allocated between shareholders and noncontrolling interests (i.e. 100 of depreciation and amortization are added back without reduction to reflect the noncontrolling owners interest in such items), our company believes that the appropriate starting point for the calculation is the net income (loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests. This allows our company to use FFO as a tool to measure the overall performance of its investment properties, as a whole, not just the portion of the investment properties controlled by our company s shareholders. Below is our company s FFO, which is a non-GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 (6) NAREIT s December 2018 White Paper provides guidance for the treatment of impairment write-downs. Specifically, To the extent there is an impairment write-down of depreciable real estate related to a REIT s main business, the write-down is excluded from FFO (i.e., adjusted from net income in calculating FFO). Additionally, NAREIT s December 2018 White Paper provides guidance on gains or losses on the sale of assets, stating the REIT has the option to include or exclude such gains and losses in the calculation of FFO. (7) Consistent with the treatment of impairment write-downs, our company includes an adjustment for its loss on extinguishment of debt. NAREIT s December 2018 White Paper encourages companies reporting FFO to make supplemental disclosure of all material non-cash revenues and expenses affecting their results for each period. We believe that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include non-cash items such as amortization of loans and above and below market leases, unbilled rent arising from applying straight line rent revenue recognition and share-based compensation expenses. Additionally, the impact of capital expenditures, including tenant improvement and leasing commissions, net of reimbursements of such expenditures by property escrow funds, is included in our calculation of AFFO. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO AFFO ), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as their exclusion is not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs. Total AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Funds from operations 997,253 (974,219) Amortization of above market leases (1) 188,903 250,504 Amortization of below market leases (2) (415,624) (274,528) Straight line rent (3) (149,831) (198,594) Capital expenditures (4) (1,019,304) (536,685) (Increase) decrease in fair value of interest rate cap (5) (220,881) 27,281 Amortization of loan issuance costs (6) 107,595 103,180 Amortization of preferred stock discount and offering costs (7) 222,881 204,383 Amortization of convertible debenture discount, offering costs and beneficial conversion feature (8) 1,718,487 Share-based compensation (9) 483,100 149,981 Bad debt expense (10) 46,932 39,024 Debt forgiveness (10) (176,300) Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) 241,024 332,514

(8) Adjustment to FFO for amortization of non-cash expenses recognized as a result of amortizing the preferred stock offering costs over its five-year term. (9) Adjustment to FFO resulting from non-cash expenses recorded for share-based compensation. (10) NAREIT s December 2018 White Paper provides guidance on non-cash revenues and expenses, stating, To provide an opportunity for consistent analysis of operating results among REITs, NAREIT encourages those reporting FFO to make supplemental disclosure of all material non-cash revenues and expenses affecting their results for each period. Our company has elected to include non-cash revenues (debt forgiveness) and non-cash expenses (bad debt expense) in its calculation of AFFO. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have omitted a discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide such information.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Manager Letter Agreement, we further amended the Management Agreement, which provides for the deferral of the acquisition fee payable to our Manager in certain circumstances, to clarify that the Deferred Acquisition Fee Amount (as defined in that certain First Amendment to the Management Agreement, dated March 19, 2021) will be deferred until the earlier of (i) the date that the public trading price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market, reaches a closing trading price of at least 5.00 per share (as the same may be proportionately adjusted to reflect a stock split or reverse stock split); (ii) the effective date of the termination of the Management Agreement as the result of an election by us to terminate the Management Agreement (other than on account of any of the events specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 11(a) of the Management Agreement); and (iii) a Change in Control.

(1) The amounts in the Stock Awards column represent the aggregate grant date fair values, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of stock awards during the applicable fiscal year under the Company s equity incentive plan. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 2018 Equity Incentive Plan If we experience a change in control, outstanding options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance units, incentive awards or other equity-based awards (including LTIP units) under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Equity Incentive Plan, will automatically become vested. Thus, outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will be fully exercisable on the change in control, restrictions and conditions on outstanding stock awards and other equity-based awards will lapse upon the change in control and performance units, incentive awards and other equity-based awards (including LTIP units) will become earned and nonforfeitable in their entirety on the change in control. The administrator may provide that outstanding awards (all of which will then be vested) will be assumed by the surviving entity or will be replaced by a comparable substitute award of substantially equal value granted by the surviving entity. The administrator may also provide that participants must surrender their outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance units, incentive awards and other equity based awards (including LTIP units) (all of which will then be vested) in exchange for a payment, in cash or shares of our common stock or other securities or consideration received by stockholders in the change in control transaction, equal to the value received by stockholders in the change in control transaction (or, in the case of options and stock appreciation rights, the amount by which that transaction value exceeds the exercise price) after acceleration of vesting for the change in control. In summary, a change in control under the Equity Incentive Plan occurs if: 

a person, entity or affiliated group (with certain exceptions) acquires, in a transaction or series of transactions, more than 50 of the total combined voting power of our outstanding securities; there occurs a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or business combination, unless the holders of our voting securities immediately prior to such transaction have more than 50 of the combined voting power of the securities in the successor entity or its parent; we (i) sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or (ii) acquire assets or stock of another entity, unless the holders of our voting securities immediately prior to such transaction have more than 50 of the combined voting power of the securities in the successor entity or its parent; or

 during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who, at the beginning of such period, constitute our Board together with any new directors (other than individuals who become directors in connection with certain transactions or election contests) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of our Board. The Code has special rules that apply to parachute payments, i.e., compensation or benefits the payment of which is contingent upon a change in control. If certain individuals receive parachute payments in excess of a safe harbor amount prescribed by the Code, the payor is denied a federal income tax deduction for a portion of the payments and the recipient must pay a 20 excise tax, in addition to income tax, on a portion of the payments. If we experience a change in control, benefits provided under the Equity Incentive Plan could be treated as parachute payments. In that event, the Equity Incentive Plan provides that the benefits under the Equity Incentive Plan, and all other parachute payments provided under other plans and agreements, will be reduced to the safe harbor amount, i.e., the maximum amount that may be paid without excise tax liability or loss of deduction, if the reduction allows the participant to receive greater after-tax benefits. The benefits under the Equity Incentive Plan and other plans and agreements will not be reduced, however, if the participant will receive greater after-tax benefits (taking into account the 20 excise tax payable by the participant) by receiving the total benefits. The Equity Incentive Plan also provides that these provisions do not apply to a participant who has an agreement with us providing that the individual is entitled to indemnification or other payment from us for the 20 excise tax or if the participant has an agreement with us providing that the participant cannot receive payments in excess of the safe harbor amount. Consulting Agreement and Retention Benefits and Change in Control Agreement Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, in the event that a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs at a time when the Consulting Agreement remains in effect and no Cause Event (as defined in the Consulting Agreement) has then occurred and we (or any successor) thereafter terminate the Consulting Agreement (other than on account of a Cause Event) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change in Control, then a Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred and we have agreed to pay to the Consultant, within thirty (30) days after such Triggering Event, the Retention Amount. Pursuant to the First Amendment, a Triggering Event shall also be deemed to have occurred (and the Retention Amount shall become payable within thirty (30) days of such Triggering Event) in the event that either (I) we terminate the Consulting Agreement pursuant to a notice of termination (other than on account of a Cause Event) ninety (90) days or fewer prior to the date of the Change in Control or (II) a Change in Control occurs at a time when the Consulting Agreement remains in effect and no Cause Event has then occurred and within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change in Control, the Consultant elects to terminate the Consulting Agreement because (i) we (or a successor) requires the Consultant to relocate its primary work location by more than fifty (50) miles from the location as of the effective date of the Consulting Agreement; (ii) we (or a successor) reduce the annual fee 250,000) of the Consultant; (iii) there is a material diminution by us (or any successor) in the Consultant s position, authority, duties or responsibilities, which includes, but is not limited to, continuing as our Chief Financial Officer (or any successor); (iv) there is a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the Consultant reports; or (v) any other action or inaction by us (or any successor) constituting a material breach of the Consulting Agreement.

Pursuant to the Change in Control Agreement, in the event that (i) a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs at a time when Mr. C. Elliott remains employed by the Consultant and no Cause Event (as defined therein) has then occurred and the Consultant thereafter terminates, at the request of our company (or any successor), the employment of Mr. C. Elliott (other than on account of a Cause Event) within twelve (12) months after the date of the Change in Control; (ii) a Change in Control occurs at a time when Mr. C.

Elliott s position, authority, duties or responsibilities with respect to services to us (or any successor); or (d) we (or any successor) commit a material breach of the Consulting Agreement and fail to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such material breach; or (iii) the Consultant terminates, at our request, Mr. C. Elliott s employment (other than on account of a Cause Event) ninety (90) or fewer days prior to the Change in Control, a Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred, and pursuant to the Change in Control Agreement, we authorized the Consultant to pay, and agreed to reimburse the Consultant for, and the Consultant agreed to pay to Mr. C. Elliott, within thirty-seven (37) days after such Triggering Event, the Elliott Retention Amount.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Management Agreement We have entered into the Management Agreement with our Manager pursuant to which it will provide for the day-to-day management of our operations.

Our Manager s role as Manager is under the supervision and direction of our Board. Our Manager does not currently manage or advise any other entities and is not actively seeking new clients in such a capacity, although it is not prohibited from doing so under the Management Agreement. Management Fees, Incentive Fees and Expense Reimbursements 

Type Description Asset Management Fee We pay our Manager a monthly asset management fee equal to 0.125 of our stockholders equity payable in arrears in cash. For purposes of calculating the asset management fee, our stockholders equity means: (a) the sum of (1) the net proceeds from (or equity value assigned to) all issuances of our company s equity and equity equivalent securities (including common stock, common stock equivalents, preferred stock and OP Units issued by our operating partnership) since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (2) our company s retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less (b) any amount that our company has paid to repurchase our common stock issued in this or any subsequent offering.

 Property Management Fee Dodson Properties, an entity in which Mr. W. Elliott holds a 6.32 interest, wholly owns Shockoe Properties. Shockoe Properties receives an annual property management fee, of up to 3.0 of the monthly gross revenue from any of our properties it manages. The Property Management Fee is paid in arrears on a monthly basis. Shockoe Properties manages our Franklin Square Property and Hanover Square North property, and it may manage additional properties we may acquire. Acquisition Fee Our Manager receives an acquisition fee of 2.0 of the purchase price plus transaction costs, for each property acquired or investment made on our company s behalf at the closing of the acquisition of such property or investment, in consideration for the Manager s assistance in effectuating such acquisition. On March 19, 2021, pursuant to a Letter Agreement, dated March 19, 2021, among us, our operating partnership and our Manager (the 2021 Letter Agreement and the 2023 Manager Letter Agreement (collectively, the Manager Letter Agreements ), our Manager agreed to defer payment of one-half of any acquisition fee payable to the Manager from that date until the earlier of: (i) the date that the public trading price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market, reaches a closing trading price of at least 5.00 per share (as the same may be proportionately adjusted to reflect a stock split or reverse stock split); (ii) the effective date of the termination of the Management Agreement as the result of an election by us to terminate the Management Agreement (other than on account of any of the events specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 11(a) of the Management Agreement); and (iii) a Change in Control (the Deferral Agreement ). For purposes of the Manager Letter Agreements, Change in Control means any of the following events: (a) any person or entity, including a group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, becomes the beneficial owner of our securities having 50 or more of the combined voting power of our then outstanding securities; (ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination or contested election, or any combination of the foregoing transactions, less than a majority of the combined voting power of our then outstanding securities after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of our securities entitled to vote generally immediately prior to such transaction; (iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of us; or (iv) the sale or other disposition of a Significant Amount of Assets to any person or entity (other than a transfer to a subsidiary of our company), and the term Significant Amount of Assets means more than fifty percent (50 of the book value of our consolidated assets as of the date of the 2023 Manager Letter Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 201,524 in acquisition fees associated with the Salisbury Marketplace Property acquisition , which were allocated and added to the fair value of the Salisbury Marketplace Property tangible assets. One half of the acquisition fee, or 100,762 was paid in cash and one half of the acquisition fee was accrued in connection with the Deferral Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred 503,910 in acquisition fees associated with the Lancer Center Property, Greenbrier Business Center Property and Parkway Property, which were allocated and added to the fair value of the Lancer Center Property, Greenbrier Business Center Property and Parkway Property tangible assets. One half of the acquisition fees, or 251,955 was paid in cash and one half of the acquisition fee was accrued in connection with the Deferral Agreement. The accrued portion of the acquisition fee is recorded under accounts payable and accrued liabilities our company s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had accrued a total of 352,717 and 251,955, respectively, in acquisition fees in connection with the Deferral Agreement. Incentive Fee Our Manager is entitled to an incentive fee, payable quarterly, equal to an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20 and (y) the difference between (i) our Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) (as further defined below) for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price of equity securities issued in our 2018 exempt offering and in future offerings and transactions, multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock and common units) in the previous 12-month period, exclusive of equity securities issued prior to our 2018 exempt offering, and (B) 7 , and (2) the sum of 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period. 

AFFO is calculated by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. We further adjust FFO for certain items that are not added to net income in NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses, and any other non-recurring or non-cash expenses, which are costs that do not relate to the operating performance of our properties, and subtract recurring capital expenditures (and, when calculating the incentive fee only, we further adjust FFO to include any realized gains or losses on our real estate investments). The following example illustrates how we would calculate our quarterly incentive fee in accordance with the Management Agreement. Our actual results may differ materially from the following example. Assume the following: 

AFFO for the 12-month period equals 4,000,000; 3,000,000 shares of common stock are outstanding and the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the 12-month period is 3,000,000; weighted average issue price per share of common stock is 10.00; and incentive fees paid during the first three quarters of such 12-month period are 300,000. 

Under these assumptions, the quarterly incentive fee payable to our Manager would be 80,000, as calculated below: 

1. AFFO 4,000,000 2. Weighted average issue price per share of common stock of 10.00 multiplied by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding of 3,000,000 multiplied by 7 2,100,000 3. Excess of AFFO over amount calculated in 2 above 1,900,000 4. 20 of the amount calculated in 3 above 380,000 5. Incentive fee equals the amount calculated in 4 above less the incentive fees paid during the first three quarters of such previous 12-month period; 300,000 6. Quarterly incentive fee payable to our Manager: 80,000 

Pursuant to the calculation formula, if AFFO increases and the weighted average share price and weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding remain constant, the incentive fee will increase. 

Our Manager computes each quarterly installment of the incentive fee within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter with respect to which such installment is payable and promptly delivers such calculation to our Board. The amount of the installment shown in the calculation is due and payable no later than the date which is five business days after the date of delivery of such computation to our Board. We have yet to pay our Manager or accrue any incentive fees. Termination Fee If we terminate the Management Agreement without Cause (as defined in the Management Agreement), we have agreed to pay our Manager a termination fee equal to three (3) times the sum of the asset management fee and incentive fee, in each case, earned by our Manager during the 12-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the effective date of the termination (the Termination Fee ). An election by us to terminate the Management Agreement will be deemed to have been made if our stockholders approve (i) a Transfer of Assets (as defined in Section 1-101(ee) of the Maryland General Corporation Law) or (ii) the voluntary dissolution of our company; provided, however , that, in either such circumstance, the Termination Fee will not be payable until the earlier of (a) the consummation of the Transfer of Assets or the voluntary dissolution of our company and (b) the effective date of the termination, which, will be the earlier of the date of the acceptance for record of articles of dissolution by the Department of Assessments and Taxation for the State of Maryland and the date specified by the our Board; provided further, however , that through the earlier of the dates provided for in (b) above, the Manager has not breached the 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 Management Agreement in the performance of its duties.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc. and Subsidiaries Richmond, Virginia Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medalist Diversified REIT, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively, the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes and schedule III (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017. March 10, 2023

 to . The Company reviews depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and makes adjustments to reflect a shorter economic life, when necessary. Capitalized leasing commissions and tenant improvements incurred and paid by the Company subsequent to the acquisition of the investment property are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease. Amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. Acquisition and closing costs are capitalized as part of each tangible asset on a pro rata basis. Improvements and major repairs and maintenance are capitalized when the repair and maintenance substantially extend the useful life, increases capacity or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable, but at least annually. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property s cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. The Company measures any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted cash flows plus its residual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the Company charges to income the excess of the carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using unobservable data such as projected future operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. The Company may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. Other than the tenant-specific losses on impairment and the impairment of assets held for sale described below, the Company did not record any impairment adjustments to its investment properties resulting from events or changes in circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, that would result in the projected value being below the carrying value of the Company s properties. During the year ended December 31, 2022, tenants defaulted on their leases and abandoned their premises. The Company determined that the carrying value of certain intangible assets and liabilities associated with these leases that were recorded as part of the purchase of these properties should be written off. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on impairment of for the year ended December 31, 2022. such tenant-related loss on impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.

 and , respectively, in unbilled rent. The Company s leases generally require the tenant to reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of its expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, insuring and managing the shopping center and common areas (collectively defined as Common Area Maintenance or CAM expenses). The Company includes these reimbursements, along with other revenue derived from late fees and seasonal events, on the consolidated statements of operations under the captions Retail center property revenues and Flex center property revenues. (See Recent Accounting Pronouncements, below.) This significantly reduces the Company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation or other outside factors. The Company accrues reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these expenses as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. The Company calculates the tenant s share of operating costs by multiplying the total amount of the operating costs by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of square feet being leased by the tenant, and the denominator of which is the average total square footage of all leasable buildings at the property. The Company also receives payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its tenants on a monthly basis throughout the year. The Company recognizes differences between previously estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the year in which the amounts become final. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company recognized and , in retail center and flex center property tenant reimbursement revenues resulting from differences between the final billed amounts and previously estimated recoveries. The Company includes these tenant reimbursement revenues on the consolidated statements of operations under the captions Retail center property revenues and Flex center property revenues. The Company recognizes lease termination fees in the period that the lease is terminated and collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, the Company provides for losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022 such termination fees were recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received a lease termination fee from a tenant in the Company s Franklin Square Property. The Company recorded this revenue as other income on the Company s consolidated statements of operation for the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon early lease termination, any unrecovered intangibles and other assets are written off as a loss on impairment. All unrecovered intangibles and other assets associated with the tenant in the Company s Franklin Square Property which terminated its lease had been fully depreciated or amortized prior to the termination. Accordingly, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, loss on impairment related to the Franklin Square tenant was recognized. However, during the year ended December 31, 2022, tenants defaulted on their leases and abandoned their premises. The Company determined that the book value of the intangible assets and liabilities, net, associated with these leases of that were recorded as part of the purchase of these properties should be written off. This amount is included in the loss on impairment reported on the Company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. such loss on impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. Hotel Property Revenues Hotel revenues from the Clemson Best Western Property (and for prior year periods, the Hampton Inn Property) were recognized as earned, which is generally defined as the date upon which a guest occupies a room or utilizes the hotel s services. Revenues from the Company s occupancy agreement with Clemson University were recognized as earned, which is as rooms are occupied or otherwise reserved for use by the University. The Clemson University occupancy agreement ended on May 15, 2022 and the Company sold the Clemson Best Western Property on September 29, 2022. The Clemson Best Western Property (and for prior year periods, the Hampton Inn Property) was required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit them back to the applicable governmental agencies on a periodic basis. The Clemson Best Western Property had a legal obligation to act as a collection agent. The Clemson Best Western Property did not retain these taxes and fees; therefore, they were not included in revenues. The Clemson Best Western Property recorded a liability when the amounts were collected and relieved the liability when payments were made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agency.

Management determined that no additional general reserve is considered necessary as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. of its taxable income to shareholders and meet certain other asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it fails to qualify. If the Company loses its REIT status it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for five years unless the Company s failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company s Clemson Best Western TRS entity generated a taxable loss, so income tax expense was recorded.

These members of the selling LLC invested in the Operating Partnership in exchange for Operating Partnership units. Additionally, as discussed above, effective on January 1, 2020, Operating Partnership units were issued in exchange for approximately of the noncontrolling owner s tenant in common interest in the Hampton Inn Property. On August 31, 2020, a unitholder converted Operating Partnership units into shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, respectively, there were Operating Partnership units outstanding. The Operating Partnership units not held by the REIT represent and of the outstanding Operating Partnership units as of the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively.

Debt With Conversion Options In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. The objective of ASU 2020-06 is to reduce the current complexity involved in accounting for convertible financial instruments by reducing the number of accounting models applicable to those instruments in the existing guidance. Following the adoption of ASU 2020-06, companies are expected to encounter fewer instances in which a convertible financial instrument must be separated into a debt or equity component and a derivative component for accounting purposes due to the embedded conversion feature. As a result of these revisions, debt instruments issued with a beneficial conversion feature will no longer require separation and thus will be accounted for as a single debt instrument under the updated guidance. In addition to those changes, ASU

 of the total annualized base revenues of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2022. The Company s geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company s retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants. Interest Rate Risk The value of the Company s real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates and fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees, all of which may affect the Company s ability to refinance property-level mortgage debt when balloon payments are scheduled. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. An increase in interest rates would likely cause the value of the Company s assets to decrease. Increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit profile of certain tenants. The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. To limit this exposure, the Company attempts to obtain mortgage financing on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. However, from time to time, the Company may obtain variable-rate mortgage loans and, as a result, may enter into interest rate cap agreements that limit the effective borrowing rate of variable-rate debt obligations while allowing participants to share in downward shifts in interest rates. These interest rate caps are derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the forecasted interest payments on the debt obligation. Our objective in using interest rate caps is to limit our exposure to interest rate movements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the Company s long-term debt either bore interest at fixed rates, or was capped to a fixed rate, or bore interest at fixed rates that were scheduled to convert to then-prevailing market fixed rates at certain future points during their term. The Company s debt obligations are more fully described in Note 5, Loans Payable, above. Other Risks and Uncertainties Since March 2020, the Company s investment properties have been significantly impacted by (i) measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders and (ii) significant changes in consumer behavior and business and leisure travel patterns.

 , depending on the amount of the abatement. In one case, the Company agreed to abate a portion of a tenant s base rent in exchange for future rent payments based on the tenant s monthly sales. Abated rent is excluded from future minimum rents in Note 6, above. While the Company s rent collections from its retail and flex center properties have stabilized, the extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 and its new variants on revenues from the Company s retail and flex center properties and tenants remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the continued efficacy of vaccines against new variants, development and deployment of treatments, and potential mutations of COVID-19 and the response thereto. Revenues will continue to be impacted by the deferral and abatement agreements that the Company has granted to various tenants and could continue to be negatively impacted until consumer demand for the goods and services of the Company s retail and flex center tenants returns to levels prior to the virus outbreak. Additionally, the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures and the potential for changes in consumer behavior and business and leisure travel patterns could continue to have a significant negative impact on consumer demand for the goods and services of the Company s retail tenants within its portfolio in the coming months. Hotel Properties The Company sold its Hampton Inn Property on August 31, 2021 and its Clemson Best Western Property on September 29, 2022 (see note 3, above). During the Company s ownership of these properties, both were specifically subject to significant decreases in occupancy and revenues due to the impact of COVID-19 on business and leisure travel and generally subject to seasonal variations in occupancy and revenues. Despite the Company s decision to sell its hotel properties, the Company has not removed hotel properties from its investment policy and will consider future opportunistic acquisitions of hotel properties in the future. Accordingly, should the Company make future investments in hotel properties, these investments could be subject to material impacts on occupancy and revenues from possible future outbreaks of COVID-19 and seasonality fluctuations in occupancy and revenues. Regulatory and Environmental As the owner of the buildings on its properties, the Company could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g.,

Exhibit 4.3 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 The following is a summary of the rights and preferences of our capital stock. While we believe that the following description covers the material terms of our capital stock, the description may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully our charter and bylaws and the relevant provisions of Maryland law for a more complete understanding of our capital stock. Copies of our charter and bylaws are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part, and the following summary, to the extent it relates to those documents, is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. See Additional Information. General Our charter provides that we may issue up to 750,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share, and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share. Common Stock All outstanding shares of our common stock are duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. Any additional common stock we issue will also be fully paid and nonassessable. Our common stock is not convertible or subject to redemption. Holders of our common stock: are entitled to receive distributions authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of legally available funds after payment of, or provision for, full cumulative distributions on and any required redemptions of shares of preferred stock then outstanding; 
 in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation or dissolution of our company, are entitled to share ratably in the distributable assets of our company remaining after satisfaction of the prior preferential rights of the preferred stock and the satisfaction of all of our debts and liabilities; and 
 do not have preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, or redemption rights or preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities and generally have no appraisal rights unless our board of directors determines that appraisal rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of shares, to one or more transactions occurring after the date of such determination in connection with which holders of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights. 
 Shares of our common stock will be held in uncertificated form, which will eliminate the physical handling and safekeeping responsibilities inherent in owning transferable stock certificates and eliminate the need to return a duly executed stock certificate to effectuate a transfer. V Stock Transfer, LLC acts as our registrar and as the transfer agent for our shares. Transfers can be effectuated simply by mailing to V Stock Transfer, LLC a transfer and assignment form, which will be provided to you at no charge upon written request. Stockholder Voting Subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of stock contained in our charter and except as may otherwise be specified in our charter, each share of common stock will have one vote per share on all matters voted on by stockholders, including election of directors. Because our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect our entire board of directors. Generally, the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast is necessary to take stockholder action, except that a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect a director and except as set forth in the next paragraph. 

Under Maryland law, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business, unless approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide in its charter for approval of these matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our charter provides for a majority vote in these situations. Our charter further provides that any or all of our directors may be removed from office for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. For these purposes, cause means, with respect to any particular director, conviction of a felony or final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holding that such director caused demonstrable material harm to us through bad faith or active and deliberate dishonesty. Each stockholder entitled to vote on a matter may do so at a meeting in person or by proxy directing the manner in which he or she desires that his or her vote be cast or without a meeting by a consent in writing or by electronic transmission. Any proxy must be received by us prior to the date on which the vote is taken. Pursuant to Maryland law and our bylaws, if no meeting is held, 100 of the stockholders must consent in writing or by electronic transmission to take effective action on behalf of our company, unless the action is advised, and submitted to the stockholders for approval, by our board of directors, in which case such action may be approved by the consent in writing or by electronic transmission of stockholders entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting of stockholders. Series A Preferred Stock Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, ranks: (a) Senior to all classes or series of common stock and to all other equity securities issued by our company expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock; (b) On parity with any future class or series of our company s capital stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock; (c) Junior to any class or series of our company s capital stock expressly designed as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company; and (d) Effectively junior to all of our company s existing and future indebtedness. Distributions. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any class or series of capital stock of our company expressly designed as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution rights, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the board and declared by our company, out of assets legally available for the payment of distributions, cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 8.0 per annum of the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to 2.00 per year). Distributions shall accrue and be cumulative from (but excluding) the original date of issuance of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock and shall be payable quarterly in equal amounts in arrears on or about the 25th day of each January, April, July and October of each year, beginning on April 25, 2020 provided, however, if any distribution payment date is not a business day, then the distribution which would payable on such distribution payment date may be paid on the next succeeding business day, and no interest or additional distributions or other sums shall accrue on the amount so payable from such distribution payment date to such next succeeding business day provided, further, that no holder of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive any distributions paid or payable on the Series A Preferred Stock with a distribution payment date before the date such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are issued. The amount of any distribution payable on the Series A Preferred Stock for any partial distribution period shall be prorated and computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Distributions shall be payable to holders of record as they appear in the stock records of our company at the close of business on the applicable record date, which shall be such date designated by the board for the payment of distributions that is not more than 90 nor less than 10 days prior to such distribution. 

Our company s board of directors will not authorize, pay or set apart for payment by our company any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock at any time that: the terms and provision of any of our company s agreements, including any agreement relating to our company s indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, payment, setting apart for payment or such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach of, or a default thereunder; or 
 the law restricts or prohibits the authorization or payment. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock accumulate whether or not: the terms and provisions of any of our company s agreements relating to our company s indebtedness prohibits such authorization, payment or setting apart for payment; 
 our company has earnings; 
 there are funds legally available for distributions; and the dividends are authorized or declared. 
 Our company will not pay or declare and set apart for payment any distributions, and no other distribution of cash or other property may be declared and made, directly or indirectly, on or with respect to, shares of parity stock or junior stock (other than a distribution paid in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, junior stock) for any period, nor shall shares of parity stock or junior stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (other than a redemption, purchase or acquisition of common stock made for purposes of and in compliance with requirements of any incentive, benefit or stock purchase plan of our company or any subsidiary thereof, or a redemption, purchase or acquisition of parity stock or junior stock as permitted under Article VI of the charter), nor shall any assets be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares by our company, directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or subscribe for shares of, junior stock, and except for purchases or exchanges pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of shares of parity stock), unless full cumulative distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock for all past distribution periods shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment. When cumulative distributions are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) on the Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all distributions declared on the Series A Preferred Stock and any other shares of parity stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of distributions declared per share of Series A Preferred Stock and per share of parity stock shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued distributions per share of Series A Preferred Stock and per share of parity stock (which shall not include any accrual in respect of unpaid distributions on any shares of parity stock for prior distribution periods if such parity stock does not have a cumulative distribution) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any distribution payment or payments on the Series A Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. Liquidation Preference. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company s affairs, before any distribution or payment may be made to holders of shares of any junior stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid, or have our company declare and set apart for payment, out of the assets of our company legally available for distribution to its stockholders, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and other liabilities of our company, a liquidation preference in cash or property at fair market value, as determined by the Board, of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid distributions(whether or not declared) to, but not including, the date of payment or the date the amount for payment is set apart. If, upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, our company s available assets are insufficient to pay the full amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of parity stock, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and such other shares of parity stock will share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to written notice of any liquidation no fewer than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the 

payment date. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our company s remaining assets. The consolidation or merger of our company with or into another entity, the merger of another entity with or into our company, a statutory share exchange by our company or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all the assets of the business of our company will not be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company. Redemption Term Redemption . Our company will redeem, out of the funds legal available, all shares of Series A Preferred Stock on February 19, 2025 at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred Stock accumulated to, but excluding, the term redemption date (whether or not earned or declared by our company but excluding interest). Optional Redemption. The Series A Preferred Stock was not redeemable prior to February 19, 2022. However, in order to ensure that our company will continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT, the Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to the transfer and ownership restrictions in our charter, including the provisions whereby shares of stock of our company owned by a stockholder in excess of the aggregate stock ownership limit will be transferred in trust pursuant to Article VI of our charter. On any business day beginning on February 19, 2022, our company may redeem in whole or from time to time in part, out of funds legally available therefor, the Series A Preferred Stock, at a redemption price per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to (x) the liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus (y) an amount equal to all unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred Stock accumulated to (but excluding) the optional redemption date (whether or not earned or declared by our company, but excluding interest). If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, then the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either; (a) pro rata; (b) by lot; or (c) in such other manner as the Board may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof and applicable law, the board will have the full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed. Change in Control. A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the company s assets and the assets of our company s subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than our company or one of our company s subsidiaries (b) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of our company s outstanding voting stock or other voting stock into which our company s voting stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares (c) our company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, our company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of our company s outstanding voting stock or the voting stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of our company s voting stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the voting stock of the surviving person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction 

(d) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board are not continuing directors, meaning they were not members of the board on the date the Series A Preferred Stock was issued or were not nominated for election, elected or appointed to the board with the approval of a majority of those directors or (e) the adoption of a plan relating to our company s liquidation or dissolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control triggering event if (a) our company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company; and (b) (i) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our company s voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (ii) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 of the voting stock of such holding company. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, unless our company has exercised the option to redeem such Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may require our company to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of payment (whether or not earned or declared by our company, but excluding interest). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or prior to any change of control triggering event, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event, a notice will be mailed to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to redeem such Series A Preferred Stock on the date specified in the applicable notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control triggering event, state that the change of control redemption is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the applicable change of control payment date. Our company will not be required to make a change of control redemption upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by our company and the third party purchases all Series A Preferred Stock properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. Our company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control redemption provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock, our company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our company s obligations under the change of control redemption provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock by virtue of any such conflict. Procedures for Redemption. If our company determines or is required to redeem, in whole or in part, shares of Series A Preferred Stock, our company will deliver a notice of redemption, by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or by electronic means to holders thereof, or request the redemption and paying agent, on behalf of our company, to promptly do so by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or by electronic means. A notice of redemption shall be provided not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice of redemption. Each such notice of redemption shall state: (a) the redemption date (b) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed (c) the CUSIP number for the Series A Preferred Stock (d) the applicable redemption price on a per share basis 

(e) if applicable, the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the board requires and the notice of redemption states) are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price (f) that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate after such redemption date and (g) the provisions hereof under which such redemption is made. If fewer than all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption delivered to such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder or the method of determining such number. Our company may provide in any notice of redemption relating to a redemption contemplated to be effected pursuant hereto that such redemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent and that our company shall not be required to effect such redemption unless each such condition has been satisfied at the time or times and in the manner specified in such notice of redemption. No defect in the notice of redemption or delivery thereof shall affect the validity of redemption proceeding, except as required by applicable law. If our company gives a notice of redemption, then at any time from and after the giving of such notice of redemption and prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date (so long as any conditions precedent to such redemption have been met or waived by our company), our company shall (i) deposit with the redemption and paying agent deposit securities having an aggregate market value on the date thereof no less than the redemption price of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the redemption date and (ii) give the redemption and paying agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the applicable redemption price to the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption on the redemption date. Our company may direct the redemption and paying agent with respect to the investment of any deposit securities consisting of cash so deposited prior to the redemption date, provided that the proceeds shall be available at the opening of business on the redemption date as same day funds. Upon the date of the deposit of such deposit securities, all rights of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease and terminate except the right of the holders thereof to receive the redemption price thereof and such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding for any purpose whatsoever (other than (A) the transfer thereof prior to the applicable redemption date and (B) the accumulation of dividends thereon in accordance with the terms hereof up to (but excluding) the applicable redemption date, which accumulated dividends, unless previously or contemporaneously declared and paid, shall be payable only as part of the applicable redemption price on the redemption date). Our company shall be entitled to receive, promptly after the redemption date, any deposit securities in excess of the aggregate redemption price of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption on the redemption date. Any deposit securities so deposited that are unclaimed at the end of 90 calendar days from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be repaid to our company, after which the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall look only to our company for payment of the redemption price thereof. Our company will be entitled to receive, from time to time after the redemption date, any interest on the deposit securities so deposited. On or after the redemption date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in certificated form (if any) that are subject to redemption shall surrender the certificate(s) representing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to our company at the placed designated in the notice of redemption and shall then be entitled to receive the redemption price for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, without interest, and in the case of a redemption of fewer than all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such certificate(s), a new certificate representing the shares of a Series A Preferred Stock that were not redeemed. Except as otherwise required by law, our company shall not redeem any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock (except by exchange for other stock of our company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of any class or series of parity preferred stock for all applicable past dividend periods (whether or not earned or declared by our company) (i) shall have been or are contemporaneously paid or (ii) shall have been or are contemporaneously declared and deposit securities or sufficient funds (in accordance with the terms of such parity preferred stock) for the payment of such dividends shall have been or are contemporaneously deposited with the redemption and paying agent or other 

applicable paying agent for such parity preferred stock in accordance with the terms of such parity preferred stock, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or acquisition of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to an otherwise lawful purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Preferred Stock for which all accumulated and unpaid dividends have not been paid. So long as no dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, our company shall be entitled at any time and from time to time to repurchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock in open-market transactions duly authorized by the board and effected in compliance with applicable laws. To the extent that any redemption for which notice of redemption has been provided is not made by reason of the absence of legally available funds, such redemption shall be made as soon as practicable to the extent such funds become available. No redemption default shall be deemed to have occurred if our company shall fail to deposit in trust with the redemption and paying agent the redemption price with respect to any shares where (1) the notice of redemption relating to such redemption provided that such redemption was subject to one or more conditions precedent and (2) any such condition precedent shall not have been satisfied at the time or times and in the manner specified in such notice of redemption. Notwithstanding the fact that a notice of redemption has been provided with respect to any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with their terms if deposit securities for the payment of the redemption price of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have been deposited in trust with the redemption and paying agent for that purpose. If a redemption date falls after a distribution record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock on such distribution record date shall be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such dividend payment date, and each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are redeemed on such redemption date shall be entitled to the dividends, if any, accruing after the end of the month to which such dividend payment date relates up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Redemption and Paying Agent as Trustee of Redemption Payments by Corporation . All deposit securities transferred to the redemption and paying agent for payment of the redemption price of shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption shall be held in trust by the redemption and paying agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock so to be redeemed until paid to such holders in accordance with the terms hereof to our company. Compliance with Applicable Law . In effecting any redemption, our company shall use its best efforts to comply with all applicable conditions precedent to effecting such redemption under any applicable Maryland law, but shall effect no redemption except in accordance with any applicable Maryland law. Modification of Redemption Procedures . Our company may, in its sole discretion and without a stockholder vote, modify the procedures set forth above with respect to notification of redemption for the Series A Preferred Stock provided that such modification does not materially and adversely affect the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or cause our company to violate any applicable law, rule or regulation and provided, further, that no such modification shall in any way alter the rights or obligations of the redemption and paying agent without its prior consent. Voting Rights. Whenever distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six consecutive quarterly periods, the number of directors then constituting the board shall be increased by two (if not already increased by reason of a similar arrearage with respect to any voting parity stock) and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class together with the holders of any other class or series of shares of parity stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors of our company at a special meeting of stockholders called by the holders of at least 33 of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or the holders of at least 33 of the outstanding shares of voting parity stock) if such request is received 90 or more days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders, or, if the request is received less than 90 days before the next annual meeting of stockholders, at the next annual meeting of stockholders, or at our company s sole discretion, a separate special meeting of stockholders to be held no later than90 days after our company s receipt of such request, and thereafter at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until all accumulated distributions on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the past distribution periods and the 

then-current distribution period shall have been fully paid. The Preferred Stock Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the outstanding shares of voting parity stock when they have voting rights (voting together as a single class) in the election to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until such directors right to hold the office terminates as described below, whichever occurs earlier. If and when all accrued distributions for past distribution periods and the distribution for the then-current distribution period on the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall immediately be divested of the voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each and every preferred distribution default) and, if all accumulated distributions for past distribution periods and the distribution for the then-current distribution period have been paid in full on all outstanding shares of voting parity stock, the term of office of each preferred stock director so elected shall immediately terminate and the number of directors shall be reduced accordingly. Any preferred stock director may be removed at any time, but only for cause, by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights and the holders of any outstanding shares of voting parity stock (voting together as a single class). So long as a preferred distribution default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a preferred stock director may be filled by written consent of the preferred stock director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights and the holders of any outstanding shares of voting parity stock (voting together as a single class). The preferred stock directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, our company shall not: (i) authorize or create, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of shares of capital stock of our company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, or reclassify any authorized shares of capital stock of our company into any such senior shares, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such senior equity securities, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of any outstanding shares of voting parity stock (voting together as a single class); or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter and articles supplementary, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock or the holders thereof, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class) provided, however, that with respect to the occurrence of any event, so long as shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged or the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock receive shares of, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or subscribe for shares of, capital stock or other securities with rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers substantially similar, taken as a whole, to the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, the occurrence of any such event shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock or the holders thereof and provided further that any increase in the amount of the authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the creation or issuance, or increase in the amounts authorized, of any other classes or series of parity stock or junior stock shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers or the holders thereof. In any matter in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote separately as a single class, each such holder shall have the right to one vote for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder. If the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of outstanding shares of voting parity stock are entitled to vote together as a single class on any matter, such holders shall each have one vote for each 25.00 of liquidation preference. The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient assets shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption. Information Rights. During any period in which our company is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, our company will (i) 

transmit by mail or other permissible means under the Exchange Act to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear in our company s record books and without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that our company would have been required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if our company were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required) and (ii) within 15 days following written request, supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of Series A Preferred Stock. Our company will mail (or otherwise provide) the reports to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which our company would have been required to file such reports with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Conversion. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of our company. Issuance of Additional Securities and Debt Instruments Our board of directors is authorized to issue additional securities, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt, for cash, property or other consideration on such terms as they may deem advisable and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock of our company into other classes or series of stock without approval of the holders of the outstanding securities. We may issue debt obligations with conversion privileges on such terms and conditions as the directors may determine, whereby the holders of such debt obligations may acquire our common stock or preferred stock. We may also issue warrants, options and rights to buy shares on such terms as the directors deem advisable, despite the possible dilution in the value of the outstanding shares which may result from the exercise of such warrants, options or rights to buy shares, as part of a ratable issue to stockholders, as part of a private or public offering or as part of other financial arrangements. Our board of directors, with the approval of a majority of the directors and without any action by stockholders, may also amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer In order to qualify as a REIT under the federal tax laws, we must meet several requirements concerning the ownership of our outstanding capital stock. Specifically, no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the federal income tax laws to include specified private foundations, employee benefit plans and trusts, and charitable trusts, during the last half of a taxable year, other than our first REIT taxable year. Moreover, 100 or more persons must own our outstanding shares of capital stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year, other than our first REIT taxable year. Because our board of directors believes it is essential for our company to qualify and continue to qualify as a REIT and for other corporate purposes, our charter, subject to the exceptions described below, provides that no person may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the federal income tax laws, more than 9.8 of: the total value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock; or 
 the total value or number (whichever is more restrictive) of outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 This limitation regarding the ownership of our shares is the 9.8 Ownership Limitation. Further, our charter provides for certain circumstances where our board of directors may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the 9.8 Ownership Limitation and establish or increase an excepted holder limit for such person. This exception is the Excepted Holder Ownership Limitation. Subject to certain conditions, our board of directors may also increase the 9.8 Ownership Limitation for one or more persons and decrease the 9.8 Ownership Limitation for all other persons. To assist us in preserving our status as a REIT, among other purposes, our charter also contains limitations on the ownership and transfer of shares of common stock that would: 

result in our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, determined without reference to any rules of attribution; 
 result in our company being closely held under the federal income tax laws; and 
 cause our company to own, actually or constructively, 9.8 or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of our real property, under the federal income tax laws or otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 Any attempted transfer of our stock which, if effective, would result in our stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be null and void, with the intended transferee acquiring no rights in such shares of stock. If any transfer of our stock occurs which, if effective, would result in any person owning shares in violation of the other limitations described above (including the 9.8 Ownership Limitation), then that number of shares the ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to violate such limitations will automatically result in such shares being designated as shares-in-trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer of such shares. The record holder of the shares that are designated as shares-in-trust, or the prohibited owner, will be required to submit such number of shares of capital stock to our company for registration in the name of the trust. We will designate the trustee, but it will not be affiliated with our company. The beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations that are named by our company. If the transfer to the trust would not be effective for any reason to prevent a violation of the limitations on ownership and transfer, then the transfer of that number of shares that otherwise would cause the violation will be null and void, with the intended transferee acquiring no rights in such shares. Shares-in-trust will remain shares of issued and outstanding capital stock and will be entitled to the same rights and privileges as all other stock of the same class or series. The trust will receive all dividends and other distributions on the shares-in-trust and will hold such dividends or other distributions in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid prior to our discovery that shares of stock have been transferred to the trust will be paid by the recipient to the trustee upon demand. Any dividend or other distribution authorized but unpaid will be paid when due to the trustee. The trust will vote all shares-in-trust and, subject to Maryland law, the trustee will have the authority to rescind as void any vote cast by the proposed transferee prior to our discovery that the shares have been transferred to the trust and to recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee will not have the authority to rescind and recast the vote. Within 20 days of receiving notice from us that shares of our stock have been transferred to the trust, the trustee will sell the shares to a person designated by the trustee, whose ownership of the shares will not violate the above ownership limitations. Upon the sale, the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold will terminate and the trustee will distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner and to the beneficiary as follows. The prohibited owner generally will receive from the trust the lesser of: the price per share such prohibited owner paid for the shares of capital stock that were designated as shares-in-trust or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price per share on the date of such transfer; or 
 the price per share received by the trust from the sale of such shares-in-trust. 
 The trustee may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by an amount equal to the dividends and other distributions that have been paid to the prohibited owner and are owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. The trust will distribute to the beneficiary any amounts received by the trust in excess of the amounts to be paid to the prohibited owner. If, prior to our discovery that shares of our stock have been transferred to the trust, the shares are sold by the proposed transferee, then the shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and, to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for the shares that exceeds the amount such prohibited owner was entitled to receive, the excess shall be paid to the trustee upon demand. In addition, the shares-in-trust will be deemed to have been offered for sale to our company, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of: the price per share in the transaction that created such shares-in-trust or, in the case of a gift or devise, the market price per share on the date of such gift or devise; or 
 the market price per share on the date that our company, or our designee, accepts such offer. 

We may reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by an amount equal to the dividends and other distributions that have been paid to the prohibited owner and are owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. We may pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary. We will have the right to accept such offer for a period of 90 days after the later of the date of the purported transfer which resulted in such shares-in-trust or the date we determine in good faith that a transfer resulting in such shares-in-trust occurred. Market price on any date means the closing price for our stock on such date. The closing price refers to the last quoted price as reported by the primary securities exchange or market on which our stock is then listed or quoted for trading. If our stock is not so listed or quoted at the time of determination of the market price, our board of directors will determine the market price in good faith. If you acquire or attempt to acquire shares of our capital stock in violation of the foregoing restrictions, or if you owned common or preferred stock that was transferred to a trust, then we will require you to give us immediate written notice of such event or, in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, at least 15 days written notice, and to provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such transfer on our status as a REIT. If you own, directly or indirectly, more than 5 , or such lower percentages as required under the federal income tax laws, of our outstanding shares of stock, then you must, within 30 days after January 1 of each year, provide to us a written statement or affidavit stating your name and address, the number of shares of capital stock owned directly or indirectly, and a description of how such shares are held. In addition, each direct or indirect stockholder shall provide to us such additional information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such ownership on our qualification as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limit. The ownership limit generally will not apply to the acquisition of shares of capital stock by an underwriter that participates in a public offering of such shares. In addition, our board of directors, upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel and upon such other conditions as our board of directors may direct, including the receipt of certain representations and undertakings required by our charter, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the ownership limit and establish or increase an excepted holder limit for such person. However, the ownership limit will continue to apply until our board of directors determines that it is no longer in the best interests of our company to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for REIT qualification. All certificates, if any, representing our common or preferred stock, will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above. The ownership limit in our charter may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction or change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for your shares or otherwise be in your interest as a stockholder. Our board of directors has exempted Alfred Lee Finley from the 9.8 ownership limit. In connection with that exemption, our board of directors set the Alfred Lee Finley s ownership limit at 15.05 of our issued and outstanding common stock. Distributions Some or all of our distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, such as from cash advances to us by our Manager, the sale of our assets, cash resulting from a waiver of asset management fees and borrowings (including borrowings secured by our assets) in anticipation of future operating cash flow until such time as we have sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund the payment of distributions therefrom. Generally, our policy is to pay distributions from cash flow from operations. Further, because we may receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year and because we may need cash flow from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures and other expenses, we expect that at least during the early stages of our development and from time to time during our operational stage, we will declare distributions in anticipation of cash flow that we expect to receive during a later period and we will pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt 

of these funds. We may fund such distributions from third party borrowings, offering proceeds, sale proceeds, advances from our Manager or sponsors or from our Manager s deferral of its base management fee. To the extent that we make payments or reimburse certain expenses to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement, our cash flow and therefore our ability to make distributions from cash flow, as well as cash flow available for investment, will be negatively impacted. In addition, to the extent we invest in development or redevelopment projects or in properties that have significant capital requirements, these properties will not immediately generate operating cash flow, although we intend to structure many of these investments to provide for income to us during the development stage. Our ability to make distributions may be negatively impacted, especially during our early periods of operation. We are required to make distributions sufficient to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT for tax purposes. Generally, distributed income will not be taxable to us under the Code if we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income. Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, in accordance with our earnings, cash flow, anticipated cash flow and general financial condition. Our board of directors discretion will be directed, in substantial part, by its intention to cause us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Many of the factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders are beyond our control, and a change in any one factor could adversely affect our ability to pay future distributions. There can be no assurance that future cash flow will support distributions at the rate that such distributions are paid in any particular distribution period. Under Maryland law, we may issue our own securities as stock dividends in lieu of making cash distributions to stockholders. We may issue securities as stock dividends in the future. Stock Exchange Listing Our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols MDRR and MDRRP, respectively. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is V Stock Transfer LLC. Their office is located at 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598.

 b. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is intended that any payment or benefit provided pursuant to or in connection with it shall be exempt from Code Section 409A as a separation pay plan (the Severance Exemption ).

 c.

 d. Except to the extent the Retention Benefits comply with another exemption from Code Section 409A under which no limit on the amount of payment would apply, in order to comply with the Severance Exemption, the payment of Retention Benefits provided in this Agreement shall not exceed the lesser of two (2) times Gunston-Employee s average annual compensation for the year prior to the year of separation from service, as adjusted for any increases intended to continue indefinitely but for the termination of employment, or the applicable Code Section 401(a)(17) limit on compensation, in each case as determined under the applicable guidance, and the benefit is paid by no later than December 31 of the second year following termination of employment. 
 e. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement, neither REIT nor Consultant shall be liable to Gunston-Employee if any payment or benefit which is to be provided pursuant to this Agreement and which is considered deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A otherwise fails to comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Code Section 409A or is otherwise subject to an excise tax imposed on Gunston-Employee.
