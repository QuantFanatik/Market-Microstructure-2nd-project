 PART I Item 1. Business Company Overview We are engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality wearable display and computing devices, also referred to as head mounted displays HMDs in the form of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. Our wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include a built-in computer, cameras, and sensors that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, enterprise data, social media or entertainment applications effectively connecting the metaverse to the real world. Our wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with our advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, less than half an inch diagonally, which when viewed through our Smart Glasses and AR glasses create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. This includes the representative forms such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) and the areas interpolated to all real-and-virtual combined environments. Our solutions are proven to help our customers improve their operational efficiency and allow users of our glasses to operate hands free. Today s near-eye or HMD products for AR, MR, XR and Virtual Reality are typically large goggles which are bulky and as a result, they have limited mass-market appeal. We have developed thin optics, called waveguides, that are fully see-through and enable miniature display engines to be mounted in the temples of the HMD which allows the form factor of the Smart Glasses to be near comparable to conventional eyeglasses. Our Smart Glasses and AR glasses are designed for all day use cases and are small enough to fit in a user s pocket or purse. No external cabling or tethering to an external computing device is required to use our current Smart Glasses unlike most competitors today. We believe that our waveguide optics and display engines offer a number of significant advantages over other wearable display solutions, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and high brightness images for use outdoors. We also believe that our waveguide optics give us a substantial advantage over competitors optics, including other waveguides, because our solution allows us to produce optics that are fully transparent when off while also delivering the high brightness required for AR and enterprise Smart Glasses applications. We believe that our compact display engine technologies coupled with our waveguides are a key differentiator for enabling next generation AR and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and many other market segments because they will ultimately allow us to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular fashion forward eyeglasses. We believe that key growth areas for us currently are the enterprise, medical, defense, and security and then ultimately will expand into broader consumer markets. We are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling our own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with our value-added resellers (VARs), distributors, software developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets that we are in the early stages of developing include the sale of components to Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs where we intend to supply mass production of our waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products or provide a white-labeled AR Smart Glasses reference design that select third parties can customize and sell as a branded product. We have developed our own intellectual property portfolio that includes not only patents, but also over 25 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials, and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. Our in-house waveguide manufacturing processes and equipment has the ability to produce in volume and at broad market price points. In 2022, we began investing in our own next generation micro-LED display technology with Atomistic SAS, a new entity based in France with whom we are engaged as a partner. We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and established position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in AR and Smart Glasses products, waveguide optics, micro LEDs and display engine technology.

 Our History Historically, we have focused on three markets: the consumer markets for VR, entertainment and mobile video; Smart Glasses products for enterprise; and night-vision display electronics and rugged mobile displays for defense markets. We introduced our first HMD products over 25 years ago and we have offered numerous product models and versions with ever-advancing features and capabilities that have served these three markets. In June 2012, we sold the assets that produced products and provided services to military organizations and defense organizations and exited the defense and security markets by giving that buyer a non-compete period of exclusivity for 10 years. Effective June 2022, all market restrictions in the defense and security space for the Company expired and, as a result, we have resumed marketing and sales initiatives directly into the defense and homeland security markets. Overall Strategy Our goal is to establish and maintain a leadership position as a worldwide supplier of wearable displays and computers including AR glasses and Smart Glasses solutions, as well as manufacturing related components needed to build such products, to third party OEMs. We strive to be an innovator in designing wearable display devices that can enable hands-free enterprise productivity applications, see-what-I see remote viewing and AR applications. We seek to generate top and bottom-line revenue growth through the continued introduction of new AR Smart Glasses, waveguides and display engines, and, to a lesser degree, software applications and solutions. To broaden our position as a leading provider of wearable display products for AR and hands-free computing, as well as waveguides and display engines for OEMs, we seek to: develop innovative products based on our unique technology for both specialized and large enterprise and medical markets, as well as for defense and security; develop a suite of software applications that can take advantage of our products, offering these solutions bundled with our hardware and through our app store promote and enhance the development of third-party software that can take advantage of our products, including offering apps and software through our own app store sell our products or license our technology to third-party companies that would incorporate and sell them as a new product with their own brand name (OEM partners); sell our waveguide products to OEMs as a standard product or on a custom order basis to meet their design requirements; develop new micro-display engine products utilizing third-party displays and ultimately our own micro LED displays to sell to third-party OEMs build or acquire our own internal capabilities to deliver SaaS-based solutions directly to our customers; extend our innovative and proprietary technology leadership; enhance and protect our intellectual property portfolio; broaden and develop strategic relationships and partnerships; establish multiple revenue sources; improve brand recognition; provide excellent products and service; and attract and retain highly qualified personnel. 
 Our strategy is also to create a leadership position as a worldwide supplier of waveguide optics and near-eye display technology solutions for applications in high growth segments of the enterprise and consumer electronics industry by capitalizing on our experience and expertise in wearable displays and computers. We aim to provide waveguides, display engines and complementary optics to enable OEM customers to serve a variety of markets with new enhanced display electronic products. Some key elements of our OEM strategy to achieve these objectives include: strengthening our technology leadership; optimizing waveguide manufacturing efficiencies while protecting proprietary processes;

 investing in new micro LED display technologies and products such as backplanes and the micro LEDs themselves; developing OEM and mass production partnerships in the AR Smart Glasses market; and leveraging third-party technology and marketing strategic relationships. 
 The Market The mobile phone has evolved into a ubiquitous, location-aware, and powerful smart mobile computing device. Mobile technology has redefined the way people interact with their world, both at work and play, and it has become an essential technology for most individuals around the globe. We believe that interactive AR content, Artificial Intelligence AI ), Edge Computing, internet of things (IoT), and speech-based cloud services will significantly further change the way such mobile computing devices are used and how content is delivered to the user, including the enabling of new experiences that cannot be experienced in any other way. We believe head-worn displays that are hands-free can connect the digital world to the real world and have the ability to change the future of the computing industry. Current mobile display technology is almost universally based upon direct view screens. These displays are designed to be handheld and small to make portability easy. Our products provide hands-free virtual large screens that are interactive and fit into eyeglass form factors. AR-based displays are designed to be see-through or see-around and allow the user to still see and interact with their surroundings. They may contain one (monocular) or two (binocular) displays. Our business for the last five years has primarily focused on enterprise, industrial and medical markets. We believe the demand for head-worn displays in these markets is being driven by such factors and expectations as: the continued growth of mobile computing devices; an increasing number of ready-to-go hands-free enterprise, commercial and medical applications for which our products are well-suited; increasing demand for Internet, and cloud services access anywhere, anytime the expansion of IoT that enables the exchange of information amongst smart connected devices to improve timeliness and visibility; the need for better efficiencies from training and on-boarding to the ROI created by having hands-free mobile computing allowing frontline workers to work more efficiently and accurately; the need to solve complex problems remotely ranging from medical technologists and doctors in a surgery to equipment in factories around the world; and the growing use of AR/XR applications that will drive the need for head-worn display solutions to replace the need to hold up handheld devices to use the applications. 
 As a result, we believe that our near-eye display technologies can significantly increase user satisfaction and allow for widespread AR adoption and applications. Target Markets We offer smart wearable display and computing products that enable the development and deployment of AR applications. AR Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. Our target markets and applications by sector are: Enterprise Our Smart Glasses products are currently focused on the enterprise market, including sectors such as industrial and medical. These Smart Glasses products run native Android applications within the glasses that, for example, allow them to stream video in real-time, scan bar codes, share visuals that are related to the work at hand and much more, all of

 which are highly useful for many enterprise applications. We believe that increasing demand for easy and instant data accessibility in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets offer significant opportunities for our products. The benefit of hands-free mobile displays and computers over a handheld device or laptop on a cart is significant. Most mobile workers need the use of their hands while working and having ready access to the information required while being hands-free can significantly improve their work performance, enhance safety, and reduce errors. Our Smart Glasses are being used for numerous applications including: remote service video support, wearable computer displays, viewing of wireless sensor data, quality assurance, hands-free access to work instructions such as assembly checklists and manuals, in-the-field maintenance, warehouse pick-and-pack, real-time viewing of remote images, and training and education. There are many reasons why enterprise users are adopting Smart Glasses, such as for: Increasing productivity; Eliminating travel costs; Improving worker safety; Lowering carbon footprint; Reducing worker errors; and Protecting worker health 
 Medical The healthcare industry continues to be an early adopter of Smart Glasses to deliver a variety of benefits in and outside of the operating room. Our Smart Glasses are being used in operating rooms to enable MedTech experts, assisting surgeons, medical student training, patient care, and other healthcare professionals to see and communicate with surgeons in real-time. This unique solution empowers surgeons, medical device specialists, and other experts to work together remotely without incurring costly expenses to commute on-sight for consultations and surgeries. Our Smart Glasses are also being used in telemedicine for remote calls made to provide a virtual presence within hospitals and senior care facilities that are video broadcast securely. Further, our Smart Glasses provide virtual training, health care for patients in the ICU and the operating room, and assistance in performing virtual patient rounds. Security and First Responders Our Smart Glasses, particularly the versions that have a sunglass look, have the potential to become disruptive and market changing products for security providers and first responders such as police and firefighters. We believe there are significant business opportunities in having the Vuzix smart glasses offering a traditional eyeglass unique form factor that can assist law enforcement and security personnel in keeping people safe or identifying suspicious persons or those associated with unlawful activities. The ability to deliver video feeds and real-time facial recognition and weapons detection alerts in a covert fashion to our smart glasses wearers literally provides security personnel and first responders with eyes in the back of their heads, allowing them to view and interact with their immediate surroundings while also staying remotely connected and informed. Consumer We believe that the most significant driver of longer-term wearable display market adoption that will change the future of computing and will result in broad adoption of AR smart glasses in smaller wearable packages will be the augmentation of the real world with cloud-based information. This capability will allow smart phone users to be able to keep their phones in their pocket and at the same time still receive location-aware content overlaid with their real-world view. These glasses are expected to be ideal for consumer needs such as language translation, closed captioning, messaging, directions, health reporting, and workout status, amongst many other things. The advent of AI programs such as OpenAI and ChatGPT are expected to, if anything, create awareness that could significantly accelerate this demand in the upcoming years. We believe that the keys to the consumer AR market are fashion forward light weight smart glasses that have the ability to support the user s prescription. Vuzix new OEM solutions offerings are pointed directly at solving for these needs.

 Applications for Smart Glasses Dozens of standard applications that are optimized for use with the growing lineup of Vuzix AR Smart Glasses are included on the devices and available for download from the Vuzix App Store. Many of these applications are similar to what is available to the customer with modern smart phones. These standard applications are designed to be simple to get started and easy-to-use, and we believe can immediately provide the fundamental benefits of Smart Glasses to novice and expert users alike. Vuzix also resells a variety of other applications, including TeamViewer Frontline and Vuzix Remote Assist (VRA), which provide remote telepresence capabilities, otherwise known as see-what-I-see video collaboration and work instructions, amongst other features. VRA enables an operator, mechanic, field technician or consultant to communicate in a hands-free manner with a remote expert to drive just-in-time video support of a process or repair. These applications increase productivity and customer satisfaction by sharing information between field technicians and remote support experts. The VRA app enables Vuzix Smart Glasses customers to multiply their expert workforce, eliminate the high costs of travel, improve customer service levels and equipment operation and accelerate knowledge transfer and training. We are offering the VRA app on a monthly or one-year subscription basis. We have also developed connector applications to enable third party applications like Zoom, Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Teams, BlueJeans and others, for use with our smart glasses. In some cases these applications will be free to the user and in others we will charge annual fees. Vuzix position as a Smart Glasses supplier fills a market need that can be long lasting and could be the basis of the future of computing if the glasses are developed into a much larger integration within current and future technology ecosystems. The idea that the Smart Glasses alone will lead to major innovations and use cases is a typical chicken and egg scenario that has played out in almost every massively disruptive technology advancement. The build it and they will come mentality works only when you build the whole thing or if you have a large enough ecosystem. Vuzix Smart Glasses have all the features and benefits consumers expect of a modern tablet or smart phone with the added benefit of being worn ergonomically on one s head, allowing for hands-free operation, and at the same time connecting the visuals in the glasses to the real world. The steady advances in the Smart Glasses hardware are impressive but this alone is not what is driving market adoption to date. The whole thing is the solution to solve the customer pain point, problems and/or inefficiencies while simultaneously creating another use case in the form of a toolbox that allows for new innovations or products. We believe Vuzix is gaining market awareness and has the opportunity to move up the value chain, increase market share and to create a sustainable higher software subscription margin business by: Properly implementing a digital solution strategy that retains more of the customer relationship across a wide range of industries; and Improving Vuzix participation in more areas of the customer relationship and having less reliance on VARs to deliver the full solution. When VARs are heavily involved in the middle of the relationship, Vuzix is primarily relegated to being a product manufacturer and seller. There is significant customer value that can be captured by adopting a solutions model including recurring revenue opportunities. 
 App Store for Smart Glasses We also have an app store on our website where users can download and purchase Smart Glasses applications, including third-party apps. We continue to foster the development of an ecosystem of third-party developers to offer applications and trials for their smart glasses apps, many of which will be sold on an industry common revenue share model, with the publisher receiving approximately 70 of the subscriptions collected. Supported by Vuzix new App Store, developers can offer or sell their applications to all Vuzix Smart Glasses users, expanding into an ecosystem of AR applications for real world use today. The app store supports free, one-time fee, and paid subscription monetization models. The Vuzix third-party developer community is able to leverage the open Android platform of the Vuzix M-Series and the Vuzix Blade to bring new and creative ideas to life.

 Waveguide Optics, Display Engines and Design Reference Kits We selectively offer waveguide optics and related coupling optics combined with our compact proprietary display engine to form a see-through display module. We sell limited numbers of our waveguide optic design reference kits to select qualified potential OEMs/ODMs, which include a projector, waveguide optics and associated electronics, to help these customers evaluate our technologies and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our proprietary solutions. Our strategy for addressing the broader mass market includes developing partnerships with both select consumer companies, including wireless communications carriers, and select high volume production manufacturing companies. Custom Solutions and Engineering Solutions Historically, we have provided fully-integrated wearable display systems, including head mounted displays, human computer interface devices, near-eye display-related engineering services and wearable computers to commercial, industrial and medical customers. Starting in June 2022 after the expiry of a 10-year non-compete, we are again able to market and sell to defense, first responders and security customers. Such potential customers include police, fire fighters, EMTs, other first responders, and homeland and border security personnel. We have an outward facing section of our website dedicated to offering our OEM and engineering services around our waveguides and display technologies. Waveguides require a display engine built for the purpose of the intended design. Vuzix is able to address most of these design specifications regardless of size, light coupling, power consumption, or resolution. Defense and Security Products As noted above, in June 2022, the 10-year non-compete restrictions with the buyer of our former defense division, TDG Acquisition LLC (DBA Six15 Technologies Six15 )) expired. This allows us to again pursue, on an unrestricted basis, opportunities related to the Company s smart glasses and waveguide optics technologies into these expanded market opportunities related to first responders, US Department of Defense, Security Organizations and the Military. Product Development We believe that the continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. Our products tend to have two to three-year life cycles. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with external consultants to continue our product development efforts. Our primary development efforts are focused on waveguide optics (and their manufacture), projection engines, new micro LED-display technologies, low-power electronic designs, firmware and wearable computing software, and the design and ergonomics of wearable displays. Our display product development efforts are focused towards continually enhancing the resolution, performance and manufacturability of our display products. We expect to increase our research and development expenditures in the future and as our revenues grow. We have also acquired and licensed technologies developed by third parties and we may continue to do so in the future. Technology We believe that it is important to make substantial investments in research and development to maintain our competitive advantage. The development and procurement of intellectual property rights relating to our technologies is a key aspect of our business strategy. We expect to continue to improve our products through our ongoing research and development and advancements made by our third-party suppliers of key components. We believe that the range of our proprietary technologies gives us a significant competitive advantage. Our technologies relate to advanced optics systems including passive and active see-through imaging waveguides, micro-

 projection display engines, investments in micro LED displays, and specialized software drivers and applications for wearable displays and computers. We also have a portfolio of trade secrets and expertise in nano-imprinting using high stability mold substrates, nano structure embossing, and engineering tool-sets for the design and manufacturing of diffractive waveguide optics. We believe that display engines are also important for commercializing wearable displays. We have developed a proprietary micro digital light processing (DLP) based engine and micro LED engines designed specifically for our waveguide optics solutions. We are currently working with multiple partners in the micro LED arena and unveiled our first micro LED display-based binocular AR Smart Glasses called the Shield as well as the Vuzix Ultralite at CES 2023. These next generation waveguides and Micro LED display engines have allowed us to shrink the entire assembly to fit in the space available in a typical off-the-shelf pair of sports sunglasses in the case of the Shield and reading glasses in the case of the Ultralite. We entered into a technology license agreement with Nokia Corporation in August 2011 for their Exit Pupil Expanding (EPE) optics technology. This agreement was amended in October 2017 to allow us greater flexibility with sub-licensing and preferable royalty terms. EPE technology is an important foundation of our diffraction-based waveguide optics technology. In October 2017 and June 2021, we acquired certain IP and patent applications from the inventor/seller related to holographic optics and display engines for image and wave field projection through a diffusive media . This technology is still in active development and we are making progress towards our first functional solution. On May 12, 2022, the Company signed a series of agreements with Atomistic SAS, a French company that is developing new micro LED displays and a related backplane. These agreements provided for an exclusive license by the Company of key micro LED technology and for the custom design of a backplane, for cash commitments totaling 30 million along with equity issuance commitments to be made by the Company relating to certain deliverables and the achievement of performance milestones by Atomistic. On December 16, 2022, the Company signed new agreements with Atomistic (the Atomistic Agreements that superseded the prior May 12, 2022 agreements, whereby the scope for the construction of a backplane was modified and the Company obtained an additional license in an alternative self-emissive micro LED technology. This multi-year project, if this new IP proves out, could result in industry-leading very efficient full color HD micro LED displays in an extremely small form-factor. Major technologies that we employ in our products include: Micro-display Optics: Optical components represent a significant cost of goods for both us and our competitors. This cost is a function of the physical size of the micro-display and the cost of the supporting optics. We have developed thin and lightweight optics that can be integrated with very small micro-displays where we can more closely match conventional eyewear frames in size and weight. These new optics and displays provide what we believe are significantly improved ergonomics compared to competing wearable display solutions. See-Through Waveguides: We have developed a range of patents and patents-pending around our see-through waveguides, as well as passive, dynamic and diffractive optics-based waveguides that are the basis for some of our future slim wearable display AR and smart glasses products. We are striving to develop ultra-compact micro-display engines to magnify and focus the light from a display into a user s eye. Our development goal with these waveguides is to create AR-based wearable displays that will appear to others as practically indistinguishable from today s conventional sunglasses by most measures, including comfort, size, weight and ergonomics. Nanoimprinting: We continue to develop a portfolio of trade secrets and expertise in nanoimprinting for use in our waveguide optics. We believe these technologies are essential to the production of our approximately 1.2 mm thick see-through lenses which we believe are the cornerstone to making fashionable eyeglass-styled Smart Glasses. We have developed technology for waveguide design and production, including: tool design and creation, custom designed software for grating structures and layout, lithography processes, high index low shrinkage polymers and other materials, mold treatments, automation equipment and test/QA processes and procedures, to name a few.

 Custom Display Engines: We have patents and patents-pending on intellectual property around micro DLP display engines. We have also worked on very compact micro LED projectors and are also working on micro LED engines designed specifically for our waveguide optics solutions. We are currently working with multiple partners on micro LED engines, both monochrome and color, and have delivered preliminary evaluation systems to select partners and potential OEM customers. Patents and other Intellectual Property We have an intellectual property policy which has as its objectives: (i) the development of new intellectual property to further our intellectual property position in relation to personal display technology; and (ii) the maintenance and protection of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. We seek to achieve these objectives through the education and training of our engineering staff and the adoption of appropriate systems, policies and procedures for the creation, identification, and protection of intellectual property. Our general practice is to file patent applications for our technology in the United States, Europe, Japan, and in additional countries, including Canada and China for inventions which we believe have the greatest potential. We file and prosecute our patent applications in pursuit of the most extensive fields of protection possible including, where appropriate, the application of the relevant technology to the broader display industry. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our supplier relationships and accumulated experience in the near-eye display field, gives us an advantage over potential competitors. We also believe our copyrights, trademarks, and patents are critical to our success and we intend to maintain and protect these. We also rely on proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how, including manufacturing processes and procedures, which are not patented. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees and, where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality, invention assignment, and non-competition agreements with us. Our technologies enable us to provide low-cost, small form factor, high-resolution wearable display products. To protect our technologies, we have developed a patent portfolio which currently consists of 148 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 130 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We are also currently preparing several invention disclosures for the purposes of submitting design and utility patent applications. Our U.S. and foreign patents expire on various dates to January 24, 2040. In addition, in connection with the sale of our defense division in 2012, we received a worldwide, royalty-free, assignable grant-back license to all the patents and other intellectual property sold for use in the manufacture and sale of products in the consumer markets. In addition to our various patents, we have 7 registered U.S. trademarks and 79 trademark registrations worldwide. Competitors The near-eye wearable computer or personal display and mobile device industry in which we operate is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. We compete against both direct view display technology in smart phones and tablets and wearable display technology. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the personal display industry include image size, image quality, image resolution, power efficiency, manufacturing cost, weight and dimension, feature implementation, AR capabilities, ergonomics, style, hands-free capabilities and, lastly, the interactive capabilities of the overall display system. Aside from direct view displays, we also have competitors who produce near-eye personal displays or wearable displays. For the past decade, most of these products were mainly low-resolution, bulky in size, ergonomically deficient, costly, and heavy in their power requirements.

 Competition Binocular Wearable Display Products Vuzix AR Smart Glasses competitors include binocular wearable displays and virtual reality systems, using micro-displays or smaller flat panels. Examples of such companies include or have included Carl Zeiss, Seiko Epson (Epson), Sony Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Avegant Corp., Meta (formerly Oculus/Facebook), HTC Corporation, Razer Inc., HP, Lenovo and many others. Some of these firms have discontinued their efforts while others continue to introduce new products. We believe that most these competitive products have received limited customer acceptance, except for Meta s products, due to their being bulky, limited operating time, and when connected to a computer, extra cables. Despite their size, VR headsets from companies like Meta and Sony have been selling in the millions of units, primarily for game applications. VR systems are either standalone devices or require a wire to be connected to a PC to operate. To date, the most popular units have been standalone devices from Meta which incorporate a computer similar to the ones used in our smart glasses products. Competition AR Glasses In the AR markets, there are currently few competitors with most of this market currently aimed at the high-end and research markets. Companies that have offered or are offering products or intend to do so in this area include Microsoft Corporation, Sony Corporation, Epson, Lenovo, Magic Leap, Nreal and CastAR. Further, industry watchers have speculated that companies such as Apple, Google, Snap, and Meta may offer or support AR wearable display products in the future, but to date, no specific product launch details have been officially announced. Today, many of these products are fairly bulky and are typically tethered to an external controller. Some are using external view cameras to simulate an AR environment where the wearer can see the outside world in effectively a pair of VR goggles with limited success thus far. The Meta Quest Pro announced in fall of 2022 is an example of this and it retails for 1,500. Many are being sold as AR Smart Glasses and are currently targeted at enterprise and academic researchers. The most complete and functional systems today are the Microsoft Hololens II and the Magic Leap Two, both of which cost 2,295 - 3,500 per unit. And Magic Leap 2 for Enterprise starts at 4,999 and higher based upon features purchased. Competition Monocular Smart Glasses and Wearable Display Products Although several companies produce monocular wearable displays, we believe that the market opportunity for these products, other than night vision products, has been limited primarily to trial tests and smaller rollouts in enterprise markets rather than broad commercial volume purchases. Competitors in these markets include or have included: Google/Alphabet, Lenovo, RealWear, Iristick, Liteye Systems, Inc., Lumus, Zebra Technologies (inclusive of the business unit formerly part of Motorola), Six-15 Technologies, LLC (the purchaser of our defense division), Optinvent, Shimadzu Corporation, Sony Corporation, Kopin Corporation, tooz technologies GmbH, Creative Display Systems, Brother, Garmin, BAE Systems, Focals by North (acquired by Google), and Rockwell Collins. Several Japanese electronics companies including Hitachi, Murata Manufacturing Co., Sony Corporation, WESTUNITIS, and Olympus have or had announced monocular smart glasses systems for industry and many have exited the business over the last three years. There are also several China-based companies that have been showing monocular smart glasses products, including Lenovo but their sales activities thus far have been somewhat limited and focused primarily on Asia. We expect that we will encounter competition in the future from major consumer electronics companies and suppliers of imaging and information products for defense applications. There is competition in all types of products we manufacture, from both large and small companies. The principal points of competition for these products include, among other factors: price, product performance, the availability of supporting applications, and the experience and brand name of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. We believe that our monocular products match or exceed the display products currently offered by our competitors. Competition Waveguides and Display Engines There are a limited number of manufacturers of waveguide optics, all targeted at OEM producers of AR and smart glasses. Competitors to our waveguide products include Lumus, WaveOptics (acquired by Snap), Digilens,

Table of Contents 
 Dispelix, Optinvent and several others. In addition, several new waveguide manufacturers from China have begun demonstrating their solutions at recent trade shows. Snap Inc. recently purchased WaveOptics and it appears that Snap is planning to use such waveguides for their own internal solutions and likely no longer will be competitive as a waveguide component supplier. Sales and Marketing Sales Our strategy is to sell our products and components both directly and through distributors and value-added resellers (VARs also referred to as Vuzix Integration Partners or VIPs), and on a select basis to OEMs. As a result, we have distinct strategies for the sales of our products. In the Smart Glasses and AR markets, we are currently focused on the enterprise space and as such are building strategic marketing relationships with software firms and distributors to address and support enterprise customers. We are, in parallel, supporting a VAR network with leading companies in various vertical markets from warehousing to field service to medical. These VARs provide their software and services offerings to their respective customer bases. We are also supporting select larger key accounts and distributors with our in-house direct sales team. For our Smart Glasses, we continue to foster an ecosystem with application developers from around the world. We also have our own hosted application store where our Smart Glasses customers can download and purchase applications and software developer kits. We currently sell our products internationally through resellers, distributors, direct to commercial customers, and via online stores and various Vuzix operated web stores in the USA, Europe and Japan. Our international focus is currently on Japan and the EMEA (including the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa). In Japan, we have a branch sales and service office and a small warehouse in Tokyo. We have a wholly-owned subsidiary, Vuzix (Europe) Limited, through which we conduct our business in the EU and Middle Eastern markets. We maintain small European sales offices in Oxford, England and Munich, Germany that are staffed by full-time sales consultants or employees. For warehousing, we have contracted with a third-party fulfillment center based in the UK and the Netherlands to service our customers in the EMEA. We also currently serve other APAC customers through North American West Coast and Tokyo sales offices. For customer support for the EMEA, we have contracted with a third-party end-user technical support firm that provides sixteen (16) hours of customer and technical support daily. We intend to primarily provide our Vuzix Ultralite OEM platform, waveguide and miniature display engine modules and optics components to select OEMs to incorporate into their branded products and sell through their own well-established distribution channels. An OEM/ODM design cycle typically requires between 6 and 24 months, depending upon the uniqueness of the market, and the complexity of the end product. Because our waveguides and display engines are the main functional component that define the imaging as well as look and feel of many of our potential OEM customers end products, we intend to work closely with these customers to provide technical assistance throughout their product evaluation and any eventual integration process. We believe that the technical nature of our OEM products, including waveguides and display projectors with micro-displays, demands close relationships with such customers. Our sales and marketing staff, assisted by our technical staff and senior management, visit prospective and existing customers worldwide on a regular basis. We believe these contacts are vital to the development of a close, long-term working relationship with our OEM customers, and in securing accurate and regular forecasts, market updates and information regarding technical and market trends. We also participate in industry specific trade shows and conferences. Marketing Our marketing and sales group, in conjunction with external firms, is responsible for product management, planning, advertising, marketing communications, and public relations. We have both internal and external public 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 relations efforts in the U.S. and UK. We also employ marketing firms to help prepare brochures, packaging, tradeshow messaging and advertising campaigns, focused on either the enterprise or consumer end markets. Most of our products are currently sold under the Vuzix brand name. We seek to have Vuzix become known as one of the premier suppliers of wearable display products for enterprise applications and AR smart glasses. We currently undertake specific marketing activities as needed, including, but not limited to: product reviews, case studies and promotions in trade publications; case studies and white papers on successful enterprise uses of Smart Glasses and AR; product and technology views for our website and social media; internet search engine ads and social media advertising and targeted emails; public relations; and trade shows and event sponsorships. 
 We engage in select marketing efforts that are intended to drive customers to our products and to help to grow awareness of our AR Smart Glasses and wearable displays in general. Public relations and product videos are an important aspect of our marketing and we intend to continue to distribute samples of our products to key industry participants. Our Smart Glasses are sold through distributors, valued-added resellers, direct to end customers, through our webstore, and through a limited number of third-party online stores, such as Amazon. Our website, www.vuzix.com, is an important part of our direct sales efforts. Engineering Services and OEM Products We primarily respond to sales inquiries for our engineering services programs and OEM component requests directly and usually in response to inbound inquiries. We do not offer works for hire services at Vuzix but rather offer our services to opportunities that could result in advancing our technology or develop into a long-term supply or OEM relationship. We believe that we have established a strong reputation for quality, performance, and innovation for wearable near-eye display systems, waveguides, and display engines that will be attractive to many types of commercial users who want to leverage our services and products within their businesses. We continue to receive inbound requests for engagement related to our proprietary waveguide optics and miniature display engines from some of the world s largest consumer and mobile electronics firms. Our business strategy is to commercialize our waveguide and display engine technologies and products to permit select ODMs and OEMs to integrate and embed our technologies and products in a way that best matches their unique capabilities and timeline for bringing their products to market. Our design and engineering staff are actively involved with customers during all phases of prototype design through to production by providing engineering data, up-to-date product application notes, regular follow-up and technical assistance. Manufacturing We purchase product components from our suppliers, engage third-party contract manufacturing firms to perform electronic circuit board and cable assemblies, and now do the final assembly of our products primarily in our West Henrietta, New York facility. We are experienced in the successful production of our products in moderate volumes. Our current facilities are capable of producing tens of thousands of finished products annually, and we believe producing out of these facilities at these levels is more economical and easier to manage than through third parties. We also manufacture all of our waveguide optics in our cleanroom environments at our West Henrietta, New York facility. We evaluate contract manufacturers and component suppliers on an ongoing basis, including whether or not to utilize new or alternative contract manufacturers or component suppliers. However, we also expect to manufacture all of our 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 waveguide optics only at our West Henrietta, New York facility. In October 2022, we announced the signing of a new lease agreement for additional floor space in a building adjacent to our West Henrietta facility for the express purpose of expanding our waveguide production capacity. We currently purchase almost all of the micro-displays used in our products from Sony Corporation, Jade Bird Display and Texas Instruments. Our relationship with these micro-display suppliers is generally on a purchase order basis and none have a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing to us on a long-term basis, nor do we have any contractual obligation to purchase micro-displays from them. We have operated this way for over a decade with these suppliers. Our Cobra II display engine is based on our proprietary design and is exclusively manufactured for us by a firm in Asia and it incorporates a DLP engine from Texas Instruments. We generally procure our other non-micro-display components and products from our vendors on a purchase order basis without any long-term commitments. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics and computer industry. We provide forecasts that allow our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials and plan capacity. Our contract manufacturers procure raw materials in volumes consistent with our forecasts, manufacture and/or assemble the products and perform tests according to our specifications. In some cases, we procure specific components and either sell them or consign them to our contract manufacturers. Products are either shipped to our customers or shipped to our West Henrietta, New York facility to be inventoried as finished goods. We currently use several manufacturing sources in Asia where we have located some of our tooling. While we do not manufacture our components, other than waveguides, we do own the tooling that is used to make our custom components. Some of our accessory products are sourced from third parties as finished goods. We typically have them print our Vuzix brand name on these products if they are co-branded. Such third-party products represented less than 5 of our sales in last three fiscal years. Our manufacturing is not currently subject to seasonal variations, but in the future, depending upon our customers product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands. Backlog There is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment of our product sales. Most purchase orders we receive are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties. In regard to sales of custom products and waveguides to our OEM customers, we believe that the backlog metric is currently of limited utility in predicting future sales because all these OEM customers operate on a ship-to-order basis. Therefore, we believe at this time that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business. Employees As of March 1, 2023, we had 105 full-time employees in North America, of which 50 are in research and development and engineering services support. In Japan we have 2 full-time employees to manage our Asian sales activities. In Europe we have 2 full-time employees and 2 full-time contractors to manage our European sales and marketing activities. Available Information We make available free of charge through our website, www.vuzix.com, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our proxy statements and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished, as well as certain of our corporate governance policies, including the charters for the Board of Directors audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees and our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and whistleblower policy. We will also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of any of the foregoing materials. Any such request must be made in writing to us, c/o Investor Relations, Vuzix Corporation, 25 Hendrix Road, West Henrietta, NY, 14586.

 Information about Geographic Revenue Information about geographic revenue is described in Note 19, Geographic and Other Financial Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. History - Corporate We were incorporated in Delaware in 1997 as VR Acquisition Corp. In 1997, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Forte Technologies, Inc. (Forte), which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of Virtual Reality headsets and the development of related technologies. Forte was originally owned and controlled by Kopin Corporation, one of our prior micro-display suppliers. Most of the technologies developed by Forte are now owned and used by us. Reference in this report to Vuzix , the Company , we, us, our and similar words refer to Vuzix Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary. Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer as a result of these risks. In that case, the market value of our securities could decline, and an investor may lose all or part of his or her investment. Summary of Risk Factors: We have incurred net losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses. We operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources and brand name of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability. We depend on advances in technology by other companies and if those advances do not materialize or are not accessible to us, some of our anticipated new products could be delayed or cancelled. Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. If we lose our rights under our third-party technology licenses, our operations could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Business We have incurred net losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses. We reported a net loss of 40,763,573 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a net loss of 40,377,160 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a net loss of 17,952,172 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have an accumulated deficit of 243,835,716 as of December 31, 2022. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We will need to increase sales in order to achieve and maintain profitability. In addition, we expect that our expenses relating to product development and research, sales and marketing, as well as our general and administrative costs, may increase as our business grows. If we do not achieve and maintain profitability, our financial condition will ultimately be materially and adversely affected and we would eventually be required to raise additional capital. We may not be able to raise any necessary capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the timeframe expected by investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.

 We operate in a highly competitive market and the size, resources and brand name of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability. The market for head-worn display devices, including AR and Smart Glasses, is highly competitive. Further, we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors introduce new and more competitive offerings alongside their existing products, and as new market entrants introduce new products into our markets. We compete against established, well-known diversified consumer electronics manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corporation, LG Electronics (LGE), HTC, Lenovo, and large software and other products companies such as Alphabet Inc. (Google), Microsoft Corporation, Meta (Facebook) and Snap. Many of our current competitors have substantial market share, longer operating histories, larger intellectual property portfolios, diversified product lines, ability to bundle competitive offerings with our products and services, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. Moreover, smartphones, tablets, and new wearable devices with ever-expanding video display screens, including foldable and expandable screens, and ever-increasing computing power have significantly improved the mobile personal computing experience. In the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc., Samsung, LGE, Lenovo, Google, Snap, Garmin, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft and others may design or develop products similar to ours. In addition to competition or potential competition from large, established companies, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products. Further, our current and prospective competitors may consolidate with each other or acquire companies that will allow them to develop products that better compete with our products, which would intensify the competition that we face and may also disrupt or lead to termination of our distribution, technology and content partnerships. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures and reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to increase the sales of our products, any one of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Our lack of long-term purchase orders and commitments from our customers may lead to a rapid decline in our sales. All of our customers issue purchase orders solely at their own discretion, often shortly before the requested date of shipment. Our customers are generally able to cancel orders (without penalty) or delay the delivery of products on relatively short notice. In addition, our current customers may decide not to purchase products from us for any reason. If those customers do not continue to purchase our products, our sales volume could decline rapidly with little or no warning. We cannot currently rely on long-term purchase orders or commitments to protect us from the negative financial effects of a decline in demand for our products. We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels and the amounts we invest in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. As a result of our lack of long-term purchase orders and purchase commitments, we may experience a rapid decline in our sales. As a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially. If we do not effectively maintain and further develop our sales channels for our products, including developing and supporting our value added resellers (VARs), distributors and retail sales channels, our business could be harmed. We depend upon effective sales channels to assist us in reaching the customers who are the ultimate purchasers of our Smart Glass and AR products. We primarily sell our products either through distributors and VARs or from our in-house sales team directly to enterprise, medical and end users or through our website.

Table of Contents 
 Our distributors, third-party online resellers and VARs generally offer products from several different manufacturers. Accordingly, we are at risk that these distributors, resellers and VARs may give higher priority to selling other companies products. If we were to lose the services of a distributor, online reseller or VAR, we might need to find another in that area, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so in a timely manner or on favorable terms. Further, our resellers and distributors can at times build inventories in anticipation of future sales, and if such sales do not occur as rapidly as they anticipate, our resellers and distributors will decrease the size of their future product orders. We are also subject to the risks of our distributors, resellers and VARs encountering financial difficulties, which could impede their effectiveness and also expose us to financial risk if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. Any reduction in sales by our current distributors or VARs, loss of key distributors and VARs or decrease in revenue from our distributors and VARs could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Our products require ongoing research and development and we may experience technical problems or delays, which could lead our business to fail. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, for example, unexpected technical problems or the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. If we experience technical problems or delays, further improvements in our products and the introduction of future products could be adversely impacted, and we could incur significant additional expenses and our business may fail. We depend on advances in technology by other companies and if those advances do not materialize, some of our anticipated new products could be delayed or cancelled. We rely on and will continue to rely on technologies (including micro-displays, mobile computing electronics and operating systems) that are developed and produced by other companies. The commercial success of certain of our planned future products will depend in part on advances in these and other technologies by other companies. We may, from time to time, contract with and support companies developing key technologies in order to accelerate the development of them for our specific uses. Such activities might not result in useful technologies or components for us. We are attempting to mitigate this risk by exploring ways to develop our own micro-display technologies using micro LED and laser scanning displays, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. If micro-display-based personal displays or near-eye displays do not gain greater acceptance in the market for mobile displays, our business strategy may fail. The mobile display market is dominated by displays larger than one-inch, most of which are based on direct view liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light emitting display (OLED) technology. A number of large established global companies have made and continue to make substantial investments in, and are conducting research to improve characteristics of, handheld direct view LCDs and OLED displays. Advances in direct view LCD and OLED technology, micro LED or other technologies, including foldable and stretchable displays may overcome current market limitations and permit them to remain or become more attractive technologies for personal viewing applications, which could limit the potential market for our near-eye display and computing technology and cause our business strategy to fail. It is difficult to assess or predict with any certainty the potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities for our micro-display-based AR Smart Glasses products or their level of market acceptance. Market acceptance of AR and Smart Glasses technology will depend, in part, upon end-user acceptance of near-to-eye displays and upon micro-display technology providing benefits comparable to or greater than those provided by alternative direct view display technology at a competitive price. Smart Glasses and AR products work best when used close to the eye, which may not be acceptable to consumers. Such acceptance may depend on the relative complexity, reliability, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of our near-eye display products compared to other display products available in the market or that may be developed by our competitors. In addition, our products are not designed for a shared experience amongst multiple viewers at the same time. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt our Smart Glasses and AR products because of concerns surrounding perceived risks relating to use and the fact that it is a new technology. Further, over half the world s adult population needs some level of vision correction which adds complexities in the design and ergonomics of any AR Smart Glasses products. If end-users fail to accept near-to-eye displays in the numbers we

Table of Contents 
 anticipate or as soon as we anticipate, the sales of our Smart Glasses and AR products and our results of operations would be adversely affected and our business strategy may fail. There are a number of competing providers of micro-display-based personal display technology, including smart glasses, and we may fail to capture a substantial portion of the personal wearable display market. In addition to competing with direct view displays, we also compete with micro-display-based personal display technologies that have been developed by other companies. Our primary personal display competitors are or have included Carl Zeiss, Inc., Sony, Epson, Alphabet (Google), Brother International, 5DT Inc., eMagin Corporation, Meta/Facebook (Oculus), Avegant, Kopin Corporation, Magic Leap, Lenovo, Microsoft, HTC, MicroVision, Inc., Lumus Ltd., Kaiser Electro Optics Inc., Garmin, Optinvent, HTC Valve, LGE, N-Real, Epson, Zebra and Accupix. Numerous other start-up companies have announced their intentions to offer smart glasses and AR products and developer kits in the near future. Further, industry blogs have speculated that companies such as Apple may offer AR glasses in the near future. Most of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, distribution and technical resources than we do. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new micro-display-based personal display technologies and near-eye display products that are more affordable or have more desirable features than our technology. If our products are unable to capture a reasonable portion of the smart wearable display market, our business strategy may fail. Product quality issues and a higher-than-expected number of warranty claims or returns could harm our business and operating results. The products that we sell could contain defects in design or manufacture. Defects could also occur in the products or components that are supplied to us. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all defects in the hardware and software we sell, which could result in product recalls, product redesign efforts, loss of revenue, reputational damage and significant warranty and other remediation expenses. Similar to other mobile and consumer electronics, our products with batteries have a potential risk of overheating in the course of usage or upon malfunction. Any such defect could result in harm to property or in personal injury. If we determine that a product does not meet product quality standards or may contain a defect, the launch of such product could be delayed until we remedy the quality issue or defect. The costs associated with any protracted delay necessary to remedy a quality issue or defect in a new product could be substantial. We generally provide a one-year warranty on all of our products, except in certain European countries where it can be two years if it is deemed a consumer-focused product. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could expose us to liability for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, and we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems. In addition, if any of our product designs are defective or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall campaign. In part due to the terms of our warranty policy, any failure rate of our products that exceeds our expectations may result in unanticipated losses. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could affect our brand image and decrease VAR, distributor and end customer confidence and demand, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, accidental damage coverage and extended warranties are regulated in the United States at the state level and are treated differently within each state. Additionally, outside of the United States, regulations for extended warranties and accidental damage vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the regulations concerning extended warranties and accidental damage coverage on a federal, state, local or international level may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to continue to offer our support services. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. Our products could likely experience declining unit prices and we may not be able to offset that decline with production cost decreases or higher unit sales. In the markets in which we compete, prices of established consumer electronics displays, personal computers, and mobile products tend to decline significantly over time or as new enhanced versions are introduced, frequently every 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 12 to 24 months. In order to maintain adequate product profit margins over the long term, we believe that we will need to continuously develop product enhancements and new technologies that will either slow price declines of our products or reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products. While we anticipate many opportunities to reduce production costs over time, we may not be able to reduce our component costs. We expect to attempt to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling price by introducing new products, increasing our sales volumes or adjusting our product mix. If we fail to do so, our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Companies in the consumer electronics, wireless communications, semiconductor, IT and display industries steadfastly pursue and protect intellectual property rights, often times resulting in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, other companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, it could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property rights and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products. Our commercial success will depend substantially on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for our products in the United States and other countries. We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that these assets are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. As of the date of this filing, we have 148 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 130 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We apply for patents covering our products, services, technologies and designs, as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Even if patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies, or designs. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from developing competing products, services technologies, or designs. Intellectual property protection and patent rights outside of the United States are even less predictable. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, we cannot be certain whether: we were the first to conceive, reduce to practice, invent, or file the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications; others will independently develop similar or alternative products, technologies, services or designs or duplicate any of our products, technologies, services or designs; any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties; we will develop additional proprietary products, services, technologies or designs that are patentable; or the patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business. 
 The patents we own or license and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 proprietary protection or competitive advantages. Moreover, third parties could replicate our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection or in territories where they could obtain a compulsory license to our technology where patented. Such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the United States or other territories. We cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, predict the breadth, validity and enforceability of the claims upheld in our and other companies patents. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our processes and products that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology is difficult and can be costly, and our efforts to do so may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with our products and, if unsuccessful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key technologies on which our business strategy depends. We rely in part on unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. We require employees, contractors, consultants, financial advisors, suppliers and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements (as appropriate), but these agreements may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our products, services, technologies and designs adequately against unauthorized third-party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. To protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate proceedings or litigation against third parties. Such proceedings or litigation may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or know-how, products, technologies, designs, brands, reputation, likeness, authorship works or other intellectual property rights. Such proceedings or litigation may also be necessary to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any proceedings or lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management s attention from other business concerns. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us, which could invalidate or narrow the scope of our own intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any proceedings or lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may be significant. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have registered and applied to register certain of our trademarks in several jurisdictions worldwide. In some jurisdictions where we have applied to register our trademarks, other applications or registrations exist for the same, similar or otherwise related products or services. If we are not successful in arguing that there is no likelihood of confusion between our marks and the marks that are the subject of the other applications or registrations owned by third parties, our applications may be denied, preventing us from obtaining trademark registrations and adequate protection for our marks in the relevant jurisdictions, which could impact our ability to build our brand identity and market our products and services in those jurisdictions. Whether or not our application is denied, third parties may claim that our trademarks infringe their rights. As a result, we could be forced to pay significant settlement costs or cease the use of these trademarks and associated elements of our brand in the United States or other jurisdictions. Even in those jurisdictions where we are able to register our trademarks, competitors may adopt or apply to register similar trademarks to ours, may register domain names that mimic ours or incorporate our trademarks, or may purchase keywords that are identical or confusingly similar to our brand names as terms in Internet search engine advertising programs, which could impede our ability to build our brand identity and lead to confusion among potential customers of our products and services. If we are not successful in proving that we have prior rights in our marks and arguing that there is a likelihood of confusion between our marks and the marks of these third parties, our inability to prevent these third parties from using such may negatively impact the strength, value and effectiveness of our brand names and our ability to market our products and prevent consumer confusion.

 If we lose our rights under our third-party technology licenses, our operations could be adversely affected. Our business depends in part on technology rights and software licensed from third parties. We could lose our exclusivity or other rights to use the technology under our licenses if we fail to comply with the terms and performance requirements of the licenses. In addition, certain licensors may terminate a license upon our breach and have the right to consent to sublicense arrangements. If we were to lose our rights under any of these licenses, or if we were unable to obtain required consents to future sublicenses, we could lose a competitive advantage in the market, and may even lose the ability to commercialize certain products or technologies completely. Either of these results could substantially decrease our revenues. Our business depends in part on access to third-party platforms or technologies, and if the access is withdrawn, denied, or is not available on terms acceptable to us, or if the platforms or technologies change without notice to us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. With the growth of mobile devices and personal voice assistants, cloud services and AI, the number of supporting platforms has grown, and with it the complexity and increased need for us to have business or contractual relationships with the platform owners in order to produce products compatible with these platforms and enable access to and use of these platforms with our products. Our product strategy includes current and future products designed for use with third-party platforms or software, such as iPhone, Android phones, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Our business in these categories relies on our access to the platforms of third parties, some of whom are our competitors. Platform owners who are competitors may limit or decline access to their platforms, and in any case have a competitive advantage in designing products for their own platforms and may produce products that work better, or are perceived to work better, than our products in connection with those platforms. As we expand the number of platforms and software applications with which our products are compatible, we may not be successful in launching products for those platforms or software applications and/or we may not be successful in establishing strong relationships with the new platform or software owners, which could negatively impact our ability to develop and produce high-quality products on a timely basis for those platforms and software applications. We may otherwise fail to navigate various new relationships, which could adversely affect our relationships with existing platform or software owners. Our access to third-party platforms may also require paying a royalty or licensing fee, which lowers our product margins or may otherwise be on terms that are not acceptable to us. In addition, the third-party platforms or technologies used to interact with our product portfolio can be delayed in production or can change without prior notice to us, which can result in our having excess inventory, lower margins, or customer support issues. If we are unable to access third-party platforms or technologies, or if our access is withdrawn, denied, or is not available on terms acceptable to us, or if the platforms or technologies are delayed or change without notice to us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and could subject us to possible litigation. We incorporate open source software into our products. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our licensed software. If an author or other third-party that distributes open source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against those allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from offering or selling our products that contained the open source software and be required to comply with the foregoing conditions. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business and financial condition.

 Our dependence on sales to distributors, VARs, and resellers increases the risks of managing our supply chain and may result in excess inventory or inventory shortages. Many of our various reseller relationships for our Smart Glasses and AR products and their accessories could involve them taking inventory positions and reselling to multiple customers. Under some possible distributor relationships, we would not recognize revenue until the distributors sell the product to their end user customers and receive payment thereon; however, at this time we do not currently enter into these types of arrangements. Our distributor and VAR relationships may reduce our ability to forecast sales and increase risks to our business. Since our distributors and VARs would act as intermediaries between us and the end user customers or resellers, we would be required to rely on our distributors to accurately report inventory levels and production forecasts. This may require us to manage a more complex supply chain and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors and VARs and their major end user customers. Our failure to manage one or more of these risks could result in excess inventory or shortages that could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. We may lose the services of key management personnel and may not be able to attract and retain other necessary personnel. Changes in our management could have an adverse effect on our business, and in particular, while our staff is relatively small with just over 100 employees and full-time foreign contractors globally, we are dependent upon the active participation of several key management personnel, including Paul Travers, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Travers is critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process. The loss of Mr. Travers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our senior management or other key personnel. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Grant Russell, a Canadian citizen, currently has his principal residence in Vancouver, Canada and a second residence in West Henrietta, New York. If he becomes unable to legally or efficiently travel to, and work in, the United States, his ability to perform some of his duties could be materially adversely affected. We need to hire and retain highly skilled technical personnel as employees and independent contractors in order to develop our products and grow our business. The competition for highly skilled technical, managerial and other personnel is at times intense. Our human capital and labor issues related to recruiting and retention success is substantially dependent upon our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to our employees. We must compete with companies that possess greater financial and other resources than we do and that may be more attractive to potential employees and contractors. To be competitive, we may have to increase the compensation, bonuses, stock options and other fringe benefits we offer to employees in order to attract and retain such personnel. Further, during COVID-19, many employees began working remotely and many now want to make it a permanent arrangement, which can further complicate the management of such personnel. The costs of retaining or attracting new personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel required to be successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Manufacturing The manufacture of waveguides encompasses several complex processes and several steps of our production processes are dependent upon certain critical machines and tools which could result in delivery interruptions, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our product technology and manufacturing processes are evolving which can result in production challenges and difficulties. We may be unable to produce our products in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, we may experience manufacturing problems which could result in delays in delivery of orders or product introductions. We currently do not have full equipment redundancy in our manufacturing facility. If we experience any significant disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facility or a serious failure of a critical piece of equipment, we may be unable to supply products to our customers in a timely manner. Interruptions in our manufacturing could be caused by equipment problems, the introduction of new equipment 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 into the manufacturing process or delays in the delivery of new manufacturing equipment. Lead-time for delivery, installation, testing, repair and maintenance of manufacturing equipment can be extensive. We have experienced production interruptions in the past and no assurance can be given that we will not lose potential sales or be able to meet production orders due to future production interruptions in our manufacturing lines. Our waveguide and display engine products are subject to lengthy OEM development periods. We intend to sell some of our waveguide and display engines with micro-displays to OEMs with the objective that they then incorporate them into products they sell. To date, this business has not been a material contributor to our overall revenues, but it could become so in the future. OEMs determine during their product development phase whether they will incorporate our products. The time elapsed between initial sampling of our products by OEMs, the custom design of our products to meet specific OEM product requirements, and the ultimate incorporation of our products into OEM products is significant, often with a duration of between one to two years or even longer. If our products fail to meet our eventual OEM customers cost, performance or technical requirements or if unexpected technical challenges arise in the integration of our products into OEM consumer products, our operating results could be significantly and adversely affected. Long delays in achieving customer qualification and incorporation of our products also could adversely affect our business. We depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components for use in our products. We do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets, microprocessors, wireless chips, optics, micro-displays, backlights, projection engines, printed circuit boards or other electronic components which are used in our products. Instead, we purchase them from third-party suppliers or rely on third-party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components, some of which are customized or custom made for us. We also may use third parties to assemble all or portions of our products. Some of these third-party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, any partial or full government-mandated shutdowns resulting from health epidemics like COVID-19 may cause supply chain disruptions. If any of these third-party contractors or suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply these integrated circuit chip sets or other critical components to us, we would be unable to manufacture and sell our products until a suitable replacement supplier could be found. We may be unable to find, if and when needed, a replacement third-party contractor or supplier on reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our products could cause our business to be unsuccessful. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The rights of holders of common stock may be impaired by the possible future issuance of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the right, without approval of the holders of our common stock (subject to the rules of any exchange on which our securities are then listed), to issue additional preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation and other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change-of-control. The possible negative impact of takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, we may issue these shares in the future. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future on our common stock. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition, and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on a stockholders investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.

 Our stock price may be volatile in the future. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations, announcements of technological innovations or new products introduced by us or our competitors, general conditions in the wireless communications, consumer electronics, semiconductor and display markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors. In addition, the public stock markets recently have experienced high price and trading volatility. The risks related to rising inflation and rising interest rates could have a material impact on our revenues and costs. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. There is uncertainty regarding the exclusive forum clause in our amended and restated bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws include a clause that provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain types of actions that may be brought against us. There is uncertainty as to whether we would seek to, or whether we could successfully, apply this exclusive forum provision to any actions that may be brought against us under the Securities Act. Additional stock offerings in the future may dilute then existing stockholders percentage ownership of our company. Given our capital plans, needs and expectations, we may issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of common stock, including convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options or warrants. The issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage ownership of the then existing stockholders. General Risk Factors Our future growth and profitability may be adversely affected if our marketing initiatives are not effective in generating sufficient levels of our product and brand awareness. Our future growth and profitability from our enterprise, industrial and medical markets focused products will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing efforts, including our ability to: create awareness of our brand and products; convert customer awareness into actual product purchases; effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) in order to maintain acceptable operating margins and return on marketing investment; and successfully offer to sell our products or license our technology to third-party companies for sale under their own brand name as OEM partners. 
 Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased total sales or generate sufficient levels of product and brand name awareness. We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis. If we fail to keep pace with changing technologies or are unable to anticipate customer preferences, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Rapidly changing customer requirements, evolving technologies and industry standards characterize the consumer electronics, IT, mobile devices, smart phone, wearables and display industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences.

 Our success depends on our ability to originate new products and to identify product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing customer demands in a timely manner. If we are unable to introduce new products or novel technologies in a timely manner or our new products or technologies are not accepted by customers, our competitors may introduce more attractive products, which could hurt our competitive position. Our new products might not receive customer acceptance if customer preferences shift to other products, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower revenue and excess inventory levels. Our business and products are subject to government regulation and we may incur additional compliance costs or, if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, may incur fines or be forced to suspend or cease operations. In our current business and as we expand into new markets and product categories, we must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations, standards and other requirements governing, among other things, electrical safety, wireless emissions, health and safety, e-commerce, consumer protection, export and import requirements, hazardous materials usage, product-related energy consumption, packaging, recycling and environmental matters. Compliance with these laws, regulations, standards and other requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (including from country to country), further increasing the cost of compliance and conducting business activities. Our products may require regulatory approvals or satisfaction of other regulatory concerns in the various jurisdictions in which they are manufactured, sold or both. These requirements create procurement and design challenges that require us to incur additional costs identifying suppliers and manufacturers who can obtain and produce compliant materials, parts and products. Failure to comply with such requirements can subject us to liability, additional costs and reputational harm and, in extreme cases, force us to recall products or prevent us from selling our products in certain jurisdictions. If there is a new regulation, or change to an existing regulation, that significantly increases our costs of manufacturing or causes us to significantly alter the way that we manufacture our products, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. Our products must comply with certain requirements of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulating electromagnetic radiation in order to be sold in the United States and with comparable requirements of the regulatory authorities of the EU, Japan, China and other jurisdictions in order to be sold in those jurisdictions. Our AR smart glasses products include wireless radios and receivers which require additional emission testing. We are also subject to various environmental laws and governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, and other hazardous chemicals used in the third-party components incorporated into our products, including the Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or the WEEE Directive, as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states, which directive restricts the distribution of products within the EU that exceed very low maximum concentration amounts of certain substances, including lead. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, Japan, and numerous countries around the world and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations. From time to time, our products are subject to new domestic and international requirements. Compliance with regulations enacted in the future could substantially increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. Any inability by us to comply with regulations in the future could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations or sales in the applicable jurisdictions. Any such inability by us to comply with regulations may also result in our not being permitted, or limit our ability, to ship our products which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve or maintain profitability. Although we have policies and procedures in place requiring our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with the supply chain transparency requirements, such as RoHS Directive, we cannot provide assurance that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new related laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics. The WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows and, although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. While we may incur increasing costs to comply with such other government regulations, we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, consolidated results of operations, earnings, or cash flows. Nonetheless, we believe that certain environmental, social and governance ESG regulations could potentially materially impact our business. We are subject to risks related to environmental, social and governance activities and disclosures (ESG) and sustainability requirements. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation and other cost increases that could adversely affect our business. Compliance with such requirements could also require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations, supply chain and products are not currently subject to carbon pricing or other legally required carbon taxation or penalties. Our operations, supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines. We intend to strive to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio. In addition, ESG reporting and disclosure requirements are continuing to evolve, with increasing global regulation and heightened investor expectations. Companies must develop an expanded set of metrics and measures, data collection and processing, controls, and reporting processes in order to meet regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. Failure to promptly and accurately meet these expectations and requirements may result in reputational and brand damage, regulatory penalties and litigation, among other things. Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products. As a public company, we are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, that require us to determine, disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we have and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used in, or necessary for the production of, our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. We also may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals

 not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials. If our customers are not satisfied with our technical support, firmware or software updates on some of our products, they may choose not to purchase our products, which would adversely impact our business and operating results. Our business relies, in part, on our customers satisfaction with the technical support, firmware, software and security updates we provide to support our products. If we fail to provide technical support services and necessary updates that are responsive, satisfy our customers expectations and resolve issues that they encounter with our products, customers may choose not to purchase additional products and we may face brand and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political, economic, public health uncertainties, wars and specific conditions in the markets we address. Any worsening of global economic, financial, or public health conditions, including global pandemics, such as COVID-19, could materially adversely affect (i) our ability to raise, or the terms of needed capital; (ii) demand for our current and future products; and (iii) the supply of components for our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or such impact on the display industry. Our results of operations may suffer if we are not able to successfully manage our increasing exposure to foreign exchange rate risks. A majority of our sales and cost of components are denominated in U.S. dollars. As our business grows, both our sales and production costs may increasingly be denominated in other currencies. Where such sales or production costs are denominated in other currencies, they are converted to U.S. dollars for the purpose of calculating any sales or costs to us. Our sales may decrease as a result of any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies. The majority of our current expenditures are incurred in U.S. dollars and many of our components come from countries that currently peg their currency against the U.S. dollar. If the pegged exchange rates change adversely or are allowed to float up, additional U.S. dollars will be required to fund our purchases of these components. Although we do not currently enter into currency option contracts or engage in other hedging activities, we may do so in the future. There is no assurance that we will undertake any such hedging activities or that, if we do so, they will be successful in reducing the risks to us of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Due to our significant level of international operations, including the use of foreign suppliers and contract manufactures, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal, political and public health risks which could harm our operating results. We purchase product components from our suppliers and engage third-party contract manufacturing firms to perform electronic circuit board and cable assemblies. We assemble our finished products to our plant in West Henrietta, New York. Additionally, we use our West Henrietta, New York facility for the production of waveguides and their related display engines and intend to do so for some time. In the future, our mature products could have their final assembly performed outside the United States. Accordingly, a substantial part of our operations, including manufacturing of certain components used in our products, could be outside of the United States and many of our customers and suppliers have some or all of their operations in countries other than the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include: compliance burdens and costs with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, particularly labor, environmental and other laws and regulations that govern our operations in those countries; 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 legal uncertainties regarding foreign taxes, tariffs, border taxes, quotas, export controls, export licenses, import controls and other trade barriers; economic instability and high levels of inflation in the countries of our suppliers and customers, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our sales; political or public health instability, including global pandemics, such as COVID-19, in the countries in which our suppliers operate; changes or volatility in currency exchange rates; and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles. 
 Any of these factors could harm our own, our suppliers and our customers international operations and businesses and impair our and/or their ability to continue expanding into international markets. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate. The global nature of our business and the significance of our international revenue create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. We operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anticorruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import and export to and from several countries, which geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (U.K. Bribery Act), and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing an advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets. The U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies. Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Commerce Department s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our customers despite such precautions. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.

 If significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed and maintained on Chinese imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. If additional significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. Since July 2018, the US Administration introduced a list of thousands of categories of goods that began facing tariffs of up to 25 , inclusive of many components and services we have sourced or have performed for us in China by suppliers there. These tariffs currently affect most of our products and we may be required to raise our prices on those products due to the tariffs, which may result in a loss of customers and harm our operating performance. If the existing tariffs are expanded or interpreted by a court or governmental agency to apply to any of our other products, we may be required to raise our prices on those products also, which may further result in a loss of customers and harm our operating performance. It is possible further tariffs will be imposed on imports of our products, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. Changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries, including changes in trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. government has indicated and demonstrated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy through the renegotiation, and potential termination, of certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements and treaties with, and the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of products and other goods from China, countries in EMEA and other countries. Given our manufacturing in those countries, and our lack of manufacturing elsewhere, policy changes in the United States or other countries, such as the tariffs already proposed, implemented and threatened, present particular risks for us. Tariffs already implemented are having an adverse effect on certain of our products and threatened additional tariffs could adversely affect more or all of our products. There are also risks associated with retaliatory tariffs and resulting trade wars. We cannot predict future trade policy, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business. A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or components or materials used in our products imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the sales, cost or gross margin of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished. Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending. If we deem it necessary to alter all or a portion of our activities or operations in response to such policies, agreements or tariffs, our capital and operating costs may increase. Our ongoing efforts to address these risks may not be effective and may have long-term adverse effects on our operations and operating results that we may not be able to reverse. Such efforts may also take time to implement or to have an effect, and may result in adverse quarterly financial results or fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements and tariffs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any significant disruption to our ecommerce business could result in lost sales. Our sales through our ecommerce channel have been growing. Sales through vuzix.com and our related EU, UK and Japanese web stores generally have higher profit margins than sales through resellers, VARs and distributors. Online sales are subject to a number of risks. System interruptions or delays could cause potential customers to fail to purchase our products and could harm our brand. The operation of our direct-to-consumer ecommerce business through vuzix.com depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Our ecommerce operations subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including risks related to the computer systems that operate our website and related support systems, such as system failures, viruses, identity information thefts, denial-of-services attacks, computer hackers and similar disruptions. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, system interruptions or delays could occur that would adversely affect our operating results.

 We utilize third-party vendors for our customer-facing ecommerce technology, portions of our order management system and fulfillment internationally. We depend on our technology vendors to manage up-time of the front-end ecommerce store, manage the intake of our orders, and export orders for fulfillment. Any failure on the part of our third-party ecommerce vendors or in our ability to transition third-party services effectively could result in lost sales and harm our business. We collect, store, process and use portions of our customers personally identifiable information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security and data protection. Any cybersecurity breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations by us, or by our third-party service providers or partners, could harm our business. We collect, store, process and use our customers personally identifiable information and other data in our transactions with them, and we rely on third parties who are not directly under our control to do so as well. While we take reasonable measures intended to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the personal information and other sensitive information we collect, store or transmit, we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur, or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information. While our privacy policies currently prohibit such activities, our third-party service providers or partners may engage in such activity without our knowledge or consent. If we or our third-party service providers were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our customers data, or if one of our third-party service providers or partners were to access our customers personal data without our authorization, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data collection, use of data and data protection is intensifying globally, and the personal information and other data we collect, store, process and use is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, especially in Europe. These laws often develop in ways we cannot predict and may materially increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand the nature and types of products we offer. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), which came into effect in the EU, and the State of California enacted California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA ), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, impose more stringent data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. These regulations require companies that process information to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties while providing a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. The burdens imposed by these and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and/or to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply. Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. The threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, unauthorized access to user data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to obtain our or our users data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative publicity, adversely affect our brand, decrease demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

 Our failure to effectively manage growth could harm our business. We intend to expand the number and types of products we sell. We will need to replace and regularly introduce on a timely basis new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded or enhanced versions of our existing products. The replacement and expansion of our products places a significant strain on our management, operations and engineering resources. Specifically, the areas that are strained most by these activities include the following: New Product Launches : With the changes in and growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in coordinating product development, manufacturing, and shipping. As this complexity increases, it places a strain on our ability to accurately coordinate the commercial launch of our products with adequate supply to meet anticipated customer demand and effectively market to stimulate demand and market acceptance. We have experienced delays in the past. If we are unable to scale and improve our product launch coordination, we could frustrate our customers and lose possible retail shelf space and product sales; Existing Products Impacted by New Introductions : The introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. We may also provide price protection to some of our retailers as a result of our new product introductions and reduce the prices of existing products. If we fail to effectively manage new product introductions, our revenue and profitability may be harmed; and Forecasting, Planning and Supply Chain Logistics : With the changes in and growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in forecasting customer demand, in planning for production, and in transportation and logistics management. If we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose product sales or accumulate excess inventory. 
 Our facilities and information systems and those of our key suppliers could be damaged as a result of disasters or unpredictable events, which could have an adverse effect on our business operations. We operate the majority of our business from one location in West Henrietta, New York (a suburb of Rochester). We also rely on third-party manufacturing plants in the United States and Asia and third-party logistics, sales and marketing facilities in Japan and Europe, and in other parts of the world to provide key components for our products and services. If major disasters such as earthquakes, pandemics, fires, floods, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, transportation disasters or other events occur in any of these locations, or our information systems or communications network or those of any of our key component suppliers breaks down or operates improperly as a result of such events, our facilities or those of our key suppliers may be seriously damaged, and we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may also incur expenses relating to such damages. If production or shipment of our products or components is stopped or delayed or if we incur any increased expenses as a result of damage to our facilities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We do not control our component suppliers, service providers and contract manufacturers or currently require them to comply with a formal code of conduct, and actions that they might take could harm our reputation and sales. We do not control our component suppliers, service providers and contract manufacturers, including their labor, environmental or other practices, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct. Though we conduct periodic visits to some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers, these visits are not frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance with applicable laws and good industry practices. A violation of labor, environmental or other laws by our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm our reputation. In addition, we may choose to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers if 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 these violations or failures were to occur. Identifying and qualifying new manufacturers or suppliers can be time consuming and we might not be able to substitute suitable alternatives in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Other consumer products companies have faced significant criticism for the actions of their manufacturers and suppliers, and we could face such criticism ourselves. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products and harm our ability to meet demand if we need to identify alternative manufacturers or suppliers. We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any one of which could disrupt our supply chain, may increase our costs, and we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users on a timely basis. Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our smart glasses products and accessories, other than waveguide optics, are sourced from third-party suppliers. The availability of certain of the components that we require to produce our AR Smart Glasses and other near-eye display products may decrease. Some of the key components used to manufacture our products come from a limited or single source of supply, or by a supplier that could potentially become a competitor. Our contract manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf from approved suppliers. We are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. The potential of partial or full government mandated shutdowns resulting from COVID-19 or other pandemics may increase these risks. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. Further the electronic components we utilize can go end-of-life due to technological changes, which can require us to invest in implementation costs of alternatives and the potential for the forced obsolescence of other related items. We have in the past experienced end-of-life issues and expect to see more shortages in the future. As such, the availability of these components may be unpredictable. As the availability of components decreases, the cost of acquiring those components ordinarily increases. High growth product categories such as the consumer electronics and mobile phone markets have experienced chronic shortages of components during periods of exceptionally high demand. If we do not properly anticipate the need for or procure critical components, we may pay higher prices for those components, our gross margins may decrease and we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users, which could reduce our competitiveness, cause a decline in our market share and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we lose access to components from a particular supplier or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a current supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect not to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Developing suitable alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may adversely affect our ability to meet our development requirements or to fill our orders in a timely or cost-effective manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the supplier s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor and other ethical practices, and if we seek to source materials from new suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could do so in a manner that does not disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Our reliance on single source, or a small number of suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to supplier capacity constraints, price increases, timely delivery, component quality, failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions, delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies; and natural disasters, fire, wars, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, including global pandemics.

 We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for any types of micro-displays, one of the key components in our products. Certain other components and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are available from only a limited number of sources, and other components and services are only available from a single source. We currently purchase almost all of the micro-displays used in our Smart Glasses products from Sony Corporation and Texas Instruments. Our relationship with these companies generally is on a purchase order basis and these firms do not have a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing to us on a long-term basis. These firms could discontinue sourcing components for us at any time. If any of these firms were to discontinue its relationship with us, or discontinue providing specific products to us, and we are unable to contract with a new supplier that can meet our requirements, or if they or such other supplier were to suffer a disruption in their production, we could experience disruption of our inventory flow, a decrease in sales and the possible need to re-design our products. Any such event could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Several new LCOS, alternative OLED, as well as micro-LED suppliers have begun offering micro-displays suitable for use in our products. With new tooling and electronics, any one of these alternative displays could be incorporated into our products but our costs of production could be higher, they may offer less performance, and, as a result, may make our products too costly and less desirable. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, inventories, product warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties We lease approximately 39,000 square feet as our main facility at 25 Hendrix Road, West Henrietta, New York, 14586 (a suburb of Rochester). This facility houses our headquarters office, R D and manufacturing space under an operating lease for the facility that we began occupying in October 2015. In October 2022, we leased an additional 12,000 square feet for our new waveguide manufacturing facility at 30 Becker Road, also in West Henrietta, New York. The base rent contractual payment obligations under these operating leases is currently 698,000 per year. The lease at 25 Hendrix Road has an original five-year term with an option by the Company to renew for two additional three-year terms at pre-agreed to lease rates. As of June 25, 2020, the Company exercised the first of the two renewal terms, extending our current lease expiration date to January 31, 2024. The lease at 30 Becker Road has an original three-year term with an option by the Company to renew for two additional one-year terms at pre-agreed to lease rates. We believe that our West Henrietta facilities are in good operating condition and currently adequately serves our needs. Note, our new expansion space at 30 Becker Road is currently under construction and its planned completion is May or June of 2023. In Oxford, England, we rent 400 square feet of office space at a cost of approximately 9,700 per year. The lease for this location expired on September 30, 2021 and is currently on a month-to-month basis.

 Item 7 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. See the discussion under Forward Looking Statements beginning on page 1 of this annual report. Overview We are engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality wearable display devices also referred to as head mounted displays (or HMDs, but also known as near-eye displays), in the form of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. Our wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include cameras, sensors, and a computer that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, social media or entertainment applications. Our wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with our advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, less than half an inch diagonally, which when viewed through our smart glasses products create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. With respect to our Smart Glasses and AR products, we are focused on the enterprise, industrial, medical and commercial markets. All of the mobile display and mobile electronics markets in which we compete have been subject to rapid technological change over the last decade including the rapid adoption of tablets, larger screen sizes and display resolutions along with declining prices on mobile phones and other computing devices, and as a result we must continue to improve our products performance and lower our costs. We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in AR and Smart Glasses products, waveguide optics, micro LEDs and display engine technology. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Developments and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The preparation of these statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, including the statement of operations, balance sheet, cash flow and related notes. We continually evaluate our estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, warranty reserves, product warranty, carrying value of long-lived assets, derivatives, valuation of stock compensation awards, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Since we cannot determine future events and their impact with certainty, the actual results may differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. We periodically re-evaluate these accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate, and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates. Our accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are: Valuation of inventories;

 Valuation of Inventories Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted average first-in, first-out method. Inventory includes purchased parts and components, work in process and finished goods. Provisions for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales, current economic trends, forecasted sales, estimated product life cycles and estimated inventory levels. Purchasing practices, electronic component obsolescence, accuracy of sales and production forecasts, introduction of new products, product life cycles, product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks. Exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks, minimum purchase lots, managing product and end-of-life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions, and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor-managed inventories. The accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period-to-period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors, ranging from purchasing to sales, production, and after-sale support. If actual demand, market conditions or product life cycles differ from estimates, inventory adjustments to net realizable values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory, an increase in inventory write-offs and a decrease to gross margins. The write-down and obsolescence provision for finished goods and components totaled 290,405, 519,950 and 1,273,835 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These provisions are included in Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Business Combinations The Company applied the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions for its business acquisition, described in further detail in Note 2. Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration transferred are measured at their acquisition-date fair value. The Company used an income approach to determine the fair values, described in further detail in Note 2. We relied upon the use of reports from third-party valuation specialists to assist in the estimation of fair values. Purchase price allocations are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Costs to acquire a business may include, but are not limited to, fees for accounting, legal and valuation services, and are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Each reporting period, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets If facts and circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset, including a products mold tooling and equipment, may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360-10 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. Impairment losses are dependent on a number of factors such as general economic trends and major technology advances, and thus could be significantly different from historical results. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a loss on fixed asset disposal of 35,350 and 183,614, respectively, upon the retirement of certain tooling and manufacturing equipment assets no longer in use. No loss on fixed asset disposal charges on tooling and equipment were recorded in 2020. We perform a valuation of our patents and trademark assets when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may be unrecoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there was an impairment charge of 97,675, 80,163 and 73,532, respectively. The value of the remaining intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks, was valued (net of accumulated amortization) at 2,220,094 as of December 31, 2022, because management believes that this value is recoverable. Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining and developing its software once technological feasibility has been determined by management or of purchased software solutions when placed into service. Such costs are accumulated and capitalized. These projects could take several years to complete. The capitalized costs are then amortized over 3 years on a straight-line basis. Unsuccessful or discontinued software projects are written off and expensed in the fiscal period where the application is abandoned or discontinued. The unamortized software development costs remaining were valued (net of accumulated amortization) at 500,000 as of December 31, 2022. Management believes that this value is recoverable. Revenue Recognition The Company adopted the guidance on Revenue from Contracts with Customers under FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as of January 1, 2018. Product sales represent the majority of the Company s revenue. The Company recognizes revenue from these product sales as performance obligations are satisfied and transfer of control to the customer has occurred, typically upon physical shipment. Revenue is recognized in the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange from the sale of our products. FOB shipping point is our standard shipping term and revenue is recognized as our products ship to customers, as control is transferred at that time. All of our standard product sales include a 30-day money back guarantee and expected returns are estimated at each reporting period date and a portion of revenue is deferred for all estimated returns. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue associated with our expected returns was immaterial. The Company collects and remits sales taxes in certain jurisdictions and reports revenue net of any associated sales taxes. Revenue from engineering consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered. The Company accounts for its longer-term development contracts, which to date have all been firm fixed-priced contracts, on

 the percentage-of-completion method, whereby income is recognized as work on contracts progresses, but estimated losses on contracts in progress are charged to operations immediately. The percentage-of-completion is determined using the cost-to-cost method. To date, all such contracts have been less than one calendar year in duration. Product Warranty Warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of our products. The warranty period for these products is generally one year and up to 18 months for certain distributors. Customers may also purchase an additional twelve (12) month extended warranty. Warranty costs are accrued, to the extent that they are not recoverable from third-party manufacturers, for the estimated cost to repair or replace products for the balance of the warranty periods. We provide for the costs of expected future warranty claims at the time of product shipment or over-builds to cover replacements. The adequacy of the provision is assessed at each quarter end and is based on historical experience of warranty claims and costs. The costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Our Board of Directors approves grants of stock awards and options to employees to purchase our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option or stock award at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted pursuant to ASC Topic 718. The application of this pricing model involves assumptions that are judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The fair market value of our common stock on the date of each option grant is determined based on the most recent quoted sales price on our primary trading stock exchange, currently the NASDAQ Capital Market. For stock options awards under the Company s LTIP (Long-term Incentive Plan), options vest upon the achievement of certain equity market conditions and performance-based milestones. The fair value of options granted under this program were calculated by using a Monte Carlo simulation for the equity market condition tranches and the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing method for the performance-based tranches. The equity market condition awards are expensed over their derived service periods, which is an output of the Monte Carlo model. Upon the achievement of any market condition milestone, any unrecognized expense to-date would be expensed immediately. The performance-based tranches, that are currently considered probable of achievement, are expensed over their respective implicit service periods. We may experience significant catch-up or reversal of expense in the future in a period when any performance-based milestones first are determined to be probable of achievement or when any that are currently deemed probable are considered no longer probable. Income Taxes We have historically incurred operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint. We provide deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based upon currently enacted tax laws. Any future recorded value of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These assets consist primarily of credit carry-forwards and net operating loss carry-forwards and the future tax effects of temporary differences between balances recorded for financial statement purposes and for tax return purposes. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur. The accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income, including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance. To date, we have determined a 100 valuation allowance is required and accordingly no deferred tax asset has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is more likely than not to be realized, an adjustment (reduction) of the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made.

 In addition, the calculation of our deferred taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed by GAAP. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. The Company currently has no uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, financial statements, revenues or expenses.

Smart glasses revenues declined primarily due to a combination of higher average sales discounts due to larger volume reseller sales, negative foreign exchange comparatives and to a lesser extent, a decrease in overall unit sales. Sales of waveguides and display engines for our engineering services customers included in product sales rose by 394,150 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Sales of engineering services for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 1,330,119, as compared to 380,333 in the same period of 2021, an increase of 250 . Cost of Sales and Gross Profit (Loss). Cost of product revenues and engineering services are comprised of materials, components, labor, warranty costs, freight costs, manufacturing overhead, software royalties, the non-cash depreciation for our tooling and manufacturing equipment and amortization of software development costs related to the production of our products and rendering of engineering services. The following table reflects the components of our cost of goods sold:

Manufacturing overhead costs, not already added in Cost of Sales, decreased by 184,545 or 8 for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the 2021 comparable period to 19 as a percentage of total sales as compared to 18 in 2021. The decrease in the net dollar amount of these unapplied overhead costs in the current period versus the prior period is primarily due to more absorption of fixed costs being allocated directly to Product Cost of Sales and inventory. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 522,150 or 40 for the year ended December 31, 2022, over the 2021 comparable period to 7 as a percentage of total sales as compared to 10 in 2021. The decrease was due to some of our tooling and manufacturing equipment becoming fully depreciated in the first half of 2022. Research and Development. Our research and development costs consist primarily of compensation costs for personnel, related stock-based compensation expenses, third-party services, purchase of research supplies and materials, and consulting fees related to research and development.

Sales revenues from our M-Series Smart Glasses were 10,254,905, a 22 increase of 1,848,282 over the prior year. Revenues of Blade Smart Glasses decreased by 395,529 or 23 in the year ended December 31, 2021 versus the comparable period in 2020 primarily driven by component shortages required to make Blade projector engines in the second half of 2021 and higher unit sales in the prior year s comparable quarter when we offered lower selling prices on the previous Blade model, which we discontinued in the fall of 2020. Sales of Engineering Services for the year ended December 31, 2021, were 380,333 as compared to 1,500,287 in the 2020 comparable period. The revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2021 for engineering services was primarily a result of waveguide and display engine development projects which commenced in 2020 and were completed in the first quarter of 2021. We believe that ongoing and new engineering services programs have been deferred to give customers time to evaluate and present to their end customers the solutions we helped to design and delivered in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, which has been made more difficult by the ongoing disruptions caused by COVID-19. Cost of Sales and Gross Profit. Cost of product revenues and engineering services are comprised of materials, components, labor, warranty costs, freight costs, manufacturing overhead, software royalties, and the non-cash depreciation for our tooling and manufacturing equipment and amortization of software development costs related to the production of our products and rendering of engineering services. The following table reflects the components of our cost of goods sold:

Manufacturing overhead costs, not already added in Cost of Sales, increased by 781,857 or 48 for the year ended December 31, 2021, over the 2020 comparable period to 18 as a percentage of total sales as compared to 14 in 2020, primarily due to manufacturing supply chain additional personnel and increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

The decrease in depreciation expense is primarily due to leasehold improvements in our West Henrietta, New York, location, which became fully amortized in October 2020. Other Income (Expense), Net . Total other expense, net was 397,053 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to income of 1,175,292 in the period in 2020. The overall decrease of 1,572,345 in other income was primarily the result of no gain from debt extinguishment in the year ended December 31, 2021, whereas we had a net gain on debt extinguishment of 1,305,900 in 2020; an increase of 203,535 in income, foreign enterprise and other taxes; and an increase of 75,301 in foreign exchange losses.

 As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any current or long-term debt obligations outstanding other than licensing fee commitments totaling 11,500,000 related to the Atomistic Agreements described in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as part of the Atomistic Agreements, the Company entered a Stock Purchase Agreement with the stockholders of Atomistic under which the Company will buy Series B Preferred shares of Atomistic through the issuance of Vuzix common shares based on certain deliverables and the achievement of milestones as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement. This will result, depending upon Vuzix share price at the time of each issuance, in the Company s issuance of a minimum of 1,750,000 to a maximum of 2,843,750 common shares to Atomistic stockholders in exchange for convertible preferred shares of Atomistic over approximately the next six to 24 months. Once Atomistic has achieved all its milestones or has them waived by the Company, and the Company issues the required number of Vuzix common shares, in exchange for Series B Preferred shares in Atomistic that could ultimately be converted into common shares of Atomistic , the Company would ultimately own just under 99.9 of Atomistic. The Company s cash requirements are primarily for funding operating losses, working capital, research and development, capital expenditures, and license fee commitments. We incurred a net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 of 40,763,573 (of which 15,775,553 was related to non-cash stock-based compensation primarily due to our LTIP), 40,377,160 (of which 17,302,833 was related to non-cash stock-based compensation primarily due to our LTIP), and 17,952,172 in 2020, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 243,835,716 as of December 31, 2022. On March 2, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase by the Company of up to an aggregate of 25 million of our common stock by open market or privately negotiated transactions under the Share Buyback Program. This program is in effect for one year, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company s sole discretion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 464,672 shares of our common stock at an average cost of 4.32. As of December 31, 2022, 464,672 shares of our common stock were held in treasury. Our operations have historically been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 72,563,943. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2022: 

Less than More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Operating Lease Obligations 1,021,753 1,021,753 Licensing Fees Commitment 11,500,000 11,500,000 Open Purchase Obligations 8,082,184 8,082,184 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We invest our excess cash in short-term highly rated corporate debt instruments or commercial paper, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrecognized gain or loss on interest rate securities. Our portfolio of marketable debt securities is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments may be affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. Our investment policy generally directs our investment managers to select investments to achieve the following goals: principal preservation, adequate liquidity, and return.

 We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through the translation of our foreign subsidiary s financial positions, results of operations, and transaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows related to business activities in Asia and the United Kingdom, and re-measurement of U.S. dollars to the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries. We are also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials whose price is in U.S. dollars but the price on future purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to pages F-1 through F-29 of this annual report and is indexed under Item 15(a)(1) and (2). Item 9 . Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures The information contained in this section covers management s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is properly recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is properly accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As a result of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. (b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized use, acquisition, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, and they concluded that our

Table of Contents 
 internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C., who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the management s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This report states that the internal control over financial reporting was effective and appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well-conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, that the objectives of the control system are met. Such controls may not prevent or detect every misstatement. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (d) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2022, except for the full remediation of the material weakness the Company reported for the year ended December 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Vuzix Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vuzix Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity, operations, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively, the financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Estimate for excess, obsolete and slow-moving inventory reserve Critical Audit Matter Description As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average first-in, first-out method. The Company records provisions for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors. The Company s products have product life cycles that range on average from two to three years. At both the product introduction and product discontinuation stage, there is a higher degree of risk of inventory obsolescence. The excess, obsolete or slow-moving reserve serves to reduce the Company s inventory balance through a charge to cost of sales products sold. The Company s reserve for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory is based upon estimates on the evaluation of changes in customer demand, technology developments, and expected future product sales, which can be difficult to forecast. If the actual realization of excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory does not meet the Company s assumptions future inventory adjustments would result in a decrease in gross profit. Due to the magnitude of the inventory, and the subjectivity involved in estimating the reserve we identified the evaluation of the reserve as a critical audit matter, which required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Addressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connecting with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. The primary procedures we performed include, performing a retrospective review of prior year-estimates used to identify potential bias of management judgments; obtaining an understanding of the process and assumptions used by management to develop the reserve for excess, obsolete and slow-moving inventory; testing the operating effectiveness of controls over management s estimate of reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory; and testing management s calculation of the reserve for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory by: testing the completeness and accuracy of the source information used, testing the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations, and evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of methodology and assumptions applied by management. Accounting for Atomistic Agreements Critical Audit Matter Description As discussed in Notes 1, 5, 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements the Company has a series of agreements with a Variable Interest Entity VIE ), Atomistic. The agreements provide for an exclusive license by the Company of key technology which includes cash commitments of 30 million. Upon achievement or acceleration of performance milestones contained in the agreements, the Company is committed to pay 2.5 million and issue a minimum of 1,750,000 shares of common stock of Company to the stockholders of Atomistic as consideration for certain shares of Atomistic. In the event the fair market value of Company stock, which is determined based upon the trailing 10-day volume weighted average price of the Company s common shares, is between a floor of 8.00 and a ceiling of 13.00, the Company may opt, at its sole discretion, to pay any fair market valuation shortfall with up to 1,093,754 additional Vuzix common stock or cash to the Atomistic owners. The Company determined based upon interactions with Atomistic, review of agreements as well as the assessment of the activity of Atomistic that most significantly impacts its economic performance, that the operating and governance structure of Atomistic does not allow the Company to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance as of December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company accounted for the series of agreements under other relevant accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. If the facts and circumstances change and the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, the Company would consolidate Atomistic into their consolidated financial statements.

The unvested balance of options as of December 31, 2020 were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share. The weighted average remaining contractual term on the vested options was years. The aggregate intrinsic value of the options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately , and , respectively.

The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards under FASB ASC Topic 718. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and share price volatility. The expected term of options granted was estimated to be the average of the vesting term, historical exercise and forfeiture rates, and the contractual life of the option. The share price volatility at the grant date is estimated using historical stock prices based upon the expected term of the options granted. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the assumed expected dividend yield is . The following summary table shows the assumptions used to compute the fair value of stock options granted, excluding LTIP, during 2022, 2021 and 2020 and their estimated value: to to Volatility to to to Risk-free interest rate to to to Expected annual dividends Value of options granted: Number of options granted Weighted average fair value per share Fair value of options granted Under FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.

 , , and , respectively. shares of common stock to its officers and certain other members of its management team. The options were granted under the Company s existing 2014 Incentive Stock Plan. The options have an exercise price of , with options vesting immediately and the remaining portion vesting upon the achievement of certain equity market capitalization milestones, and revenue and EBITDA operational milestones. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of and , respectively, for options that vested or are probable to vest. There was stock-based compensation expense related to the Company s LTIP in the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value of option grants was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation for the equity market capitalization tranches and the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing method for the operational milestone tranches. As of December 31, 2022, we had of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the portion of options tied to equity market capitalization milestones and the portion of options tied to operational milestones that were considered probable of achievement, all of which will be recognized over a service period of up to three to . The probabilities of the milestone achievements are subject to catch-up adjustments in each instance where an equity market capitalization milestone is achieved or when an operational milestone becomes probable to be achieved or is achieved. Compensation costs could be reversed in subsequent periods if an awardee leaves the Company prior to the expiration of the option life for market capitalization milestone or performance award vesting of a performance award no longer determined to be probable. If such milestones are achieved earlier in their expected service periods, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to that particular milestone would be accelerated and recognized in full during the period where that achievement is affirmed by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, and going forward, should all of the operational milestones which are currently not yet deemed probable of achievement become probable of achievement or are achieved, then the Company could ultimately recognize up to an additional million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense at such time. The unvested remaining equity market and operational milestones under the LTIP with their total related option grants and criteria achievement weightings of the options available for meeting a target are shown in the following table. Of the total unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2022, there are options unvested for the achievement of Equity Market Capitalization targets, unvested options for the achievement of annual Revenue targets, and unvested options for the achievement of annual EBITDA Margins Before Non-Cash Charges targets. of Options Available of Options Available of Options Available Options Available (Subject to Vesting) Equity Market Capitalization Target Last Twelve Months Revenue Target Last Twelve Months EBITDA Margin before Non-Cash Charges Target
