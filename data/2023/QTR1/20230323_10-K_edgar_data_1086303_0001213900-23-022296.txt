New
Business Initiative Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized Space Therapy Chamber Project 

Since
the beginning of 2019, Mr. Xu has led the core research and development team of Kangzi to develop and manufacture a new medical product,
the Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized Space Therapy Chamber (the Chamber ). Utilizing submillimeter waves, the Chamber
is a medical equipment designed to treat cancer through cold nuclear fusion caused by cosmic ray muons in an enclosed chamber. Specifically,
we believe that exposure to an appropriate amount of submillimeter waves could accelerate the generation of a large number of cosmic
ray muons inside the human body and that such cosmic ray muons could further facilitate cold nuclear fusion, which could reverse the
cancering process through which selenium is converted into nickel inside cells. 

2 

The
team consists of researchers whom have extensive experience in medicine and physics. The lead scientist of the team, Mr. Xu, had served
as the deputy chief engineer of the New Energy Base of the National Defense-Science and Technology Commission in 1995, as the chairman
and chief scientist of Shanghai Guangcon New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. from 2011 to 2019, and the director of Shanghai Hengbian New
Energy Research Institute from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Mr. Xu was rewarded the Harmony-Person of the Year in China at the
 2011 Harmony China Annual Summit in Beijing and recognized as Leaping China: One of the Most Influential People
of the Year in 2011 by China International Economic and Technical Cooperation Promotion Association, China Elite Culture Promotion
Association, and China Outstanding Chinese Merchants Association. In 2013, the Organizing Committee of Boau Forum on Asian SME Development
awarded Mr. Xu 2013 China Economic Outstanding Contribution Award. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Share Transfer Agreement entered into by JSEL and Kangzi on January 17, 2019, JSEL has the right to monitor and manage
all aspects of operation of Kangzi, including its research and development activities relating to the Chamber. As the development of
the Chamber enters its final stage at Kangzi, JSEL started accepting pre-orders for the Chamber in September. Subsequently, on October
15 2019, JSEL entered into a clinical cooperation agreement (the Clinical Cooperation Agreement with Shenzhen Saikun Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. Saikun ). Pursuant to the Clinical Cooperation Agreement, Saikun agreed to pay JSEL 5.5 million RMB as the total
preordering payment. 1.5 million RMB and 1.5 million RMB were delivered to JSEL respectively on September 7 and September 27, 2019. The
parties are working on the timing for payment of the remaining 2.5 million RMB due under the Clinical Cooperation Agreement. In exchange,
JSEL is obligated to purchase all the components of a Chamber from Kangzi, fully assemble it, and conduct a clinical trial with Saikun,
third-party hospital partners, and patients using the Chamber. Specifically, after receiving the full amount of payment from Saikun,
JSEL shall transport the Chamber to its preferred location, properly install it, and conduct a clinical trial that lasts at least one
month. During the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide training sessions regarding the proper operation of the Chamber to Saikun s
employees. Both Saikun and JSEL are obligated to find third-party hospitals whom will agree to act as partners to co-host the clinical
trial and patients whom will be voluntarily willing to undergo treatment provided by the Chamber. While Saikun is responsible for various
expenses related to the clinical trial, JSEL is responsible for communicating with patients receiving treatment and other patient-related
administrative matters. When JSEL determines that Saikun is capable of properly operating the Chamber and managing activities related
to the Chamber, Saikun may request JSEL to move the Chamber to a location designated by Saikun and reinstall it. Furthermore, upon the
successful completion of the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide Saikun governmental permits necessary for the operation of the Chamber,
and Saikun shall operate the Chamber and provide related services to patients under the supervision of JSEL. In addition, JSEL shall
transfer the right of using the Chamber and any beneficiary right affiliated to using the Chamber to Saikun upon receiving the full amount
of payment from Saikun. JSEL, nevertheless, owns all the intellectual property rights affiliated with the Chamber. If the two parties
decide to terminate the Clinical Cooperation Agreement prior to the expiration of the term, Saikun s right of using the Chamber
during the term is still effective as long as its use of the Chamber does not infringe any of JSEL s intellectual property rights
affiliated with the Chamber. The two parties agreed that the term of the Clinical Cooperation Agreement would not end until Kangzi successfully
obtains permits issued by relevant government entities supervising development and sale of medical equipment. 

To
prepare for the mass production of Chambers, Kangzi is conducting clinical experiments to make further improvements on Chamber and adjusting
features of the mass-production mold for Chamber. Kangzi is also in the process of obtaining official governmental permits from relevant
government authorities to produce and sell Chambers on a national scale. As its long-term business strategy, Kangzi focuses on researching,
developing, and manufacturing high-technology medical equipment while targeting both individual and institutional customers. It plans
to massively manufacture Chambers in small and medium sizes, establish operation centers to sell Chambers in various cities across China,
and initiate advertising and marketing campaigns on different media platforms. Kangzi will also monetize on services provided to customers
who use Chambers and other medical products. 

In
addition to business activities related to Chamber, the Company will commit to the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of
healthcare equipment and various health products containing natural plants, including cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and drugs.
In the near future, the Company aims to standardize and internationalize the production and sale of healthcare equipment and health products,
while increasing its brand awareness in the healthcare and consumer-product markets.

There
is limited public trading market for our Common Stock; our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol HYBT. 

The
market price of our Common Stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results,
general trends in the market, and other factors, over many of which we have little or no control. In addition, broad market fluctuations,
as well as general economic, business, and political conditions, may adversely affect the market for our Common Stock, regardless of
our actual or projected performance. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink Market is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations
in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with a company s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure
you that there will be a market for our Common Stock in the future. 

The
following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales price per share of our Common Stock for the periods indicated. The prices

of Ditiantai subject to certain adjustment provisions (the Ditiantai Acquisition ). The letter of intent has been terminated,
and the Company is not pursuing this proposed acquisition any further. 

On
January 17, 2019, Jiashierle (Xiamen) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. JSEL ), a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of the People s Republic of China (the PRC ), and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the Share Transfer Agreement with Mr. Yu Xu Mr. Xu ), an individual
who owned 90 of the equity interests of Shanghai Kangzi Medical Technology Co., Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the
laws of the PRC Kangzi ). Pursuant to the Share Transfer Agreement, Mr. Xu transferred 60 of the equity interests of Kangzi
to JSEL on January 17, 2019 for the purpose of developing a joint venture in the business of selling medical equipment. In return, JSEL
would fund the operations of Kangzi in proportion to its equity interest in Kangzi. Kangzi owned no assets and conducts no business operation
of its own. As a result, as of January 17, 2019, Kangzi became an indirect subsidiary of the Company. 

On
March 15, 2019, the Company, with the approval of the Board, entered into a Share Cancellation Agreement (the Share Cancellation
Agreement with Mr. Ban Siong Ang, the President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of the Company. Pursuant
to the Share Cancellation Agreement, the Company and Mr. Ang agreed to cancel 109,006,861 shares of Common Stock previously issued to

In
March 2019, the Company entered into a Raspberry Purchase Agreement and a Raspberry Juice Processing Agreement with Ditiantai. Pursuant
to these two agreements, the Company purchased six tons of raspberry from Ditiantai, which were processed by Ditiantai into raspberry
juice and delivered to the Company. The Company then sold the raspberry juice to a corporate buyer and five individual buyers. The Company,
however, does not plan to engage in the business of selling raspberry juice in the long term. 

Since
the beginning of 2019, Mr. Xu has led the core research and development team of Kangzi to develop and manufacture a new medical product,
the Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized Space Therapy Chamber (the Chamber ). Utilizing submillimeter waves, the Chamber
is a medical equipment designed to treat cancer through cold nuclear fusion caused by cosmic ray muons in an enclosed chamber. Specifically,
we believe that exposure to an appropriate amount of submillimeter waves could accelerate the generation of a large number of cosmic
ray muons inside the human body and that such cosmic ray muons could further facilitate cold nuclear fusion, which could reverse the
cancering process through which selenium is converted into nickel inside cells. 

The
team consists of researchers whom have extensive experience in medicine and physics. The lead scientist of the team, Mr. Xu, had served
as the deputy chief engineer of the New Energy Base of the National Defense-Science and Technology Commission in 1995, as the chairman
and chief scientist of Shanghai Guangcon New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. from 2011 to 2019, and the director of Shanghai Hengbian New
Energy Research Institute from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Mr. Xu was rewarded the Harmony-Person of the Year in China at the
 2011 Harmony China Annual Summit in Beijing and recognized as Leaping China: One of the Most Influential People
of the Year in 2011 by China International Economic and Technical Cooperation Promotion Association, China Elite Culture Promotion
Association, and China Outstanding Chinese Merchants Association. In 2013, the Organizing Committee of Boau Forum on Asian SME Development
awarded Mr. Xu 2013 China Economic Outstanding Contribution Award.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Share Transfer Agreement entered into by JSEL and Kangzi on January 17, 2019, JSEL has the right to monitor and manage
all aspects of operation of Kangzi, including its research and development activities relating to the Chamber. As the development of
the Chamber enters its final stage at Kangzi, JSEL started accepting pre-orders for the Chamber in September. Subsequently, on October
15 2019, JSEL entered into a clinical cooperation agreement (the Clinical Cooperation Agreement with Shenzhen Saikun Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. Saikun ). Pursuant to the Clinical Cooperation Agreement, Saikun agreed to pay JSEL 5.5 million RMB as the total
preordering payment. 1.5 million RMB and 1.5 million RMB were delivered to JSEL respectively on September 7 and September 27, 2019. The
parties are working on the timing for payment of the remaining 2.5 million RMB due under the Clinical Cooperation Agreement. In exchange,
JSEL is obligated to purchase all the components of a Chamber from Kangzi, fully assemble it, and conduct a clinical trial with Saikun,
third-party hospital partners, and patients using the Chamber. Specifically, after receiving the full amount of payment from Saikun,
JSEL shall transport the Chamber to its preferred location, properly install it, and conduct a clinical trial that lasts at least one
month. During the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide training sessions regarding the proper operation of the Chamber to Saikun s
employees. Both Saikun and JSEL are obligated to find third-party hospitals whom will agree to act as partners to co-host the clinical
trial and patients whom will be voluntarily willing to undergo treatment provided by the Chamber. While Saikun is responsible for various
expenses related to the clinical trial, JSEL is responsible for communicating with patients receiving treatment and other patient-related
administrative matters. When JSEL determines that Saikun is capable of properly operating the Chamber and managing activities related
to the Chamber, Saikun may request JSEL to move the Chamber to a location designated by Saikun and reinstall it. Furthermore, upon the
successful completion of the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide Saikun governmental permits necessary for the operation of the Chamber,
and Saikun shall operate the Chamber and provide related services to patients under the supervision of JSEL. In addition, JSEL shall
transfer the right of using the Chamber and any beneficiary right affiliated to using the Chamber to Saikun upon receiving the full amount
of payment from Saikun. JSEL, nevertheless, owns all the intellectual property rights affiliated with the Chamber. If the two parties
decide to terminate the Clinical Cooperation Agreement prior to the expiration of the term, Saikun s right of using the Chamber
during the term is still effective as long as its use of the Chamber does not infringe any of JSEL s intellectual property rights
affiliated with the Chamber. The two parties agreed that the term of the Clinical Cooperation Agreement would not end until Kangzi successfully
obtains permits issued by relevant government entities supervising development and sale of medical equipment. 

To
prepare for the mass production of Chambers, Kangzi is conducting clinical experiments to make further improvements on Chamber and adjusting
features of the mass-production mold for Chamber. Kangzi is also in the process of obtaining official governmental permits from relevant
government authorities to produce and sell Chambers on a national scale. As its long-term business strategy, Kangzi focuses on researching,
developing, and manufacturing high-technology medical equipment while targeting both individual and institutional customers. It plans
to massively manufacture Chambers in small and medium sizes, establish operation centers to sell Chambers in various cities across China,
and initiate advertising and marketing campaigns on different media platforms. Kangzi will also monetize on services provided to customers
who use Chambers and other medical products. 

In
addition to business activities related to Chamber, the Company will commit to the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of
healthcare equipment and various health products containing natural plants, including cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and drugs.
In the near future, the Company aims to standardize and internationalize the production and sale of healthcare equipment and health products,
while increasing its brand awareness in the healthcare and consumer-product markets.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as a result of a material weakness primarily related to a lack of a sufficient number of personnel with appropriate training and experience
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. To remediate the material weakness, our Chief Financial
Officer, as a member of CPA Australia, hence a Certified Public Accountant in Australia, has attended professional trainings regarding
applying GAAP on a regular basis. In the near future, we also intend to hire more personnel with sufficient training and experience in
GAAP. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such item is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our current chief executive officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under
this framework, current management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation
dates due to the same reasons illustrated in Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures above. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

We
believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within any company have been detected.

Family
Relationships 

Our
Executive Director, Mr. Tan, is the brother in law of our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Mr. Ang. None
of our other directors or executive officers has a family relationship as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To
the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years: 

been
 convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 

had
 any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business
 association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years
 prior to that time; 

been
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction
 or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in
 any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be
 associated with persons engaged in any such activity; 

14 

been
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

been
 the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently
 reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged
 violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions
 or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution,

 Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons
 associated with a member. 

Director
Independence 

After
review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, our Board has determined
that Ms. Kwee Huwa Tan, Mr. Stephan Truly Busch, Mr. Senad Busatlic, and Mr. Zengqiang Lin are independent directors as
defined under the NASDAQ listing standards. Pursuant to the applicable NASDAQ listing standards, an independent director 
refers to a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 

Board
Meetings 

The
Board did not hold any meeting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 

Committees
of the Board of the Company 

We
do not have a standing nominating, compensation, or audit committee. Rather, our full Board performs the functions of these committees.
We do not believe it is necessary for our Board to appoint such committees because the volume of matters that come before our Board for
consideration permits the directors to give sufficient time and attention to such matters to be involved in all decision making. Additionally,
because our Common Stock is not listed for trading or quotation on a national securities exchange, we are not required to have such committees. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined
that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business
conduct, and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event that our operations, employees, and directors expand in the
future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and greater than 10 beneficial owners of our Common Stock to file
reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers, and greater than 10 stockholders are required
by the rules and regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on the Company s
review of the copies of such forms it has received and written representations from certain reporting persons with respect to the period
from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022, the Company believes that all of its officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial
owners, complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them during the Company s most recently completed fiscal
year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To: The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of 

Heyu Biological Technology
Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Heyu Biological Technology Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss, statement of stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had
incurred substantial losses during the year, and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters are described in Note 2. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 1 

Operating lease 

As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements,
the Company recognized right-of-use assets and liabilities for certain operating lease. Determining the value of right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities requires management to make judgements over key estimates and assumptions. Addressing the matter involved performing
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. The audit engagement
team performed procedures, which includes, among others, evaluating the accuracy of the calculation and assessing the inputs used in the
calculation.

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

Exhibit 4.1 

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
REGISTERED PURSUANT TO 

 SECTION 12 OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED 

 General 

The following description summarizes the most
important terms of our securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This summary
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation Articles of Incorporation ). For a complete description of our securities, you should refer to our Articles of Incorporation
and the applicable provisions of Chapters 78 and 92A of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the Nevada Statutes ). 

We are incorporated as a Nevada company, and
our affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Nevada. As used in this section, we, 
 us, our, and the Company mean Heyu Biological Technology Corporation and its successors, but
not any of its subsidiaries. 

Authorized Capital Stock 

Under our Articles of Incorporation, our
authorized capital stock consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share. As of March 23, 2023, we had
1,032,466,000 shares of common stock outstanding, held of record by 669 stockholders. This number excludes any estimate by us
of the number of beneficial owners of shares held in street name, the accuracy of which cannot be guaranteed. 

Common Stock. 

Our common stock is listed on The OTC Pink
Market, under the symbol HYBT. 

Voting. Holders of common stock are
entitled to one vote per share. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. 

Dividends. Except as provided by
law or in our articles of incorporation, the holders of common stock will be entitled to such cash dividends as may be declared from
time to time by the board of directors of the Company (the Board of Directors from funds available . 

Liquidation. Upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all assets available for distribution
to such holders after payment of our liabilities. 

Other Terms. Holders of common stock
are not entitled to preemptive rights, nor is the common stock subject to redemption. 

Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws with Anti-Takeover Implications 

Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws Bylaws deal with matters of corporate governance and the rights of stockholders. Under
our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors may set the voting rights, preferences and other terms thereof. Our Bylaws provide
that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the President, or by the President or Secretary at the request of a majority
of the directors or stockholders owning not less than 25 of our issued and outstanding voting stock. Such provisions, together with
certain provisions of the Nevada Statutes (see Nevada Anti-Takeover Statutes ), could be deemed to have an anti-takeover
effect and discourage takeover attempts not first approved by our Board of Directors. This may include takeovers that certain stockholders
may deem to be in their best interest. Any such discouraging effect on takeover attempts could potentially depress the market price of
our common stock or inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored
takeover attempts. 

Nevada Anti-Takeover Statutes 

Business Combinations Act 

We are subject to Nevada s anti-takeover
law because we have not opted out of the provisions of Sections 78.411-78.444 of the Nevada Statutes under the terms of our Articles
of Incorporation. This law provides that specified persons who, together with affiliates and associates, own, or within two years did
own, 10 or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation cannot engage in specified business combinations with the corporation
for a period of two years after the date on which the person became an interested stockholder. The law defines the term business
combination to encompass a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested stockholder, including mergers, asset
sales and other transactions in which the interested stockholder receives or could receive a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with
other stockholders. This provision may have an anti-takeover effect for transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors,
including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. 

Control Share Statute 

A corporation is subject to Nevada s control
share law if it has more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and if the corporation
does business in Nevada, including through an affiliated corporation. This control share law may have the effect of discouraging corporate
takeovers. We currently have less than 100 stockholders of record who are residents of Nevada. 

The control share law focuses on the acquisition
of a controlling interest, which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares that would be sufficient, but for the operation
of the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation
in the election of directors: (1) one-fifth or more but less than one-third; (2) one-third or more but less than a majority; or (3) a
majority or more. The ability to exercise this voting power may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others. 

The effect of the control share law is that an
acquiring person, and those acting in association with that person, will obtain only such voting rights in the control shares as are
conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control
share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to take
away voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant
voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The acquiring
person is free to sell the shares to others. If the buyer or buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest,
the shares are not governed by the control share law. 

If control shares are accorded full voting rights
and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, a stockholder of record, other than
the acquiring person, who did not vote in favor of approval of voting rights, is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder s
shares. 

Transfer Agent 

The transfer agent for our capital stock is Standard
Registrar and Transfer Company, Inc., located at 440 East 400 South, Suite 200, Salt Lake City, UT 84111. Their telephone number is (801)
