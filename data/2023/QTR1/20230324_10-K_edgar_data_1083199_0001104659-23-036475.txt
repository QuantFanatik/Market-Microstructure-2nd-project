ITEM 1117 OF REGULATION AB. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

The following events have been brought to our attention by U.S. Bank
National Association, in its capacity as indenture trustee: 

U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other
large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed
securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions,
allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to
comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees 
purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties,
notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and
abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 

U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations
under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and
it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to
the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 

On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware
statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit
in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other
institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The
National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al. , C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del.
Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result
of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans.
Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing
that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 

U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint
in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of
the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court
ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court
entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery
concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending. 

U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has
performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the
plaintiffs claims vigorously. 

Except as described in the previous paragraphs,
no other legal proceedings are pending (or known to be contemplated by governmental authorities) against any of World Omni Financial Corp.
(the Sponsor ), World Omni Auto Receivables LLC (the Depositor ), U.S. Bank National Association (the Indenture
Trustee ), the Trust or the other parties described in Item 1117 of Regulation AB nor is any property of any of the foregoing entities
subject to any such proceedings, that are material to holders of the Notes or the Certificates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To Management and the Board of Directors of World
Omni Financial Corp. 

We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that World Omni Financial Corp. (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation
AB for all asset-backed securities transactions of automobile and light duty truck retail installment sale contracts sponsored by World
Omni Financial Corp. since January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (the Platform ), as of
December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(ix),
1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable
to the activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and
the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted
by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted
under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion,
and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. World Omni
Financial Corp. s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated,
in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related
to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed
by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors
that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that
World Omni Financial Corp complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022
for all asset-backed securities transactions of automobile and light duty truck retail installment sale contracts sponsored by World Omni
Financial Corp. since January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission is fairly stated, in all material respects.

of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed
those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although
the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there
were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to
be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of the Company
and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that
the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the U.S. Bank Corporate
Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
