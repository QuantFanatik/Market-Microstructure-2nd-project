 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Annual Report Report (including, but not limited to, the information contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans, and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used, statements which are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as anticipate, estimate, should, expect, believe, intend, and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

This data involves several assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties and contained in this report, and accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described under the headings Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. 
 These forward-looking statements are subject, but not limited to, various risks and uncertainties, including those relating to: 
 defaults on the mortgage loans securing our mortgage revenue bonds MRBs and governmental issuer loans GILs ); 

the competitive environment in which we operate;

general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; 

uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; 

adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; 

general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which we operate, which may be unfavorably impacted by increases in mortgage interest rates, slowing economic growth, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; 

changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies we may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on our investments and our cost of financing; 

persistent inflationary trends, spurred by multiple factors including expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, higher commodity prices, a tight labor market, and low residential vacancy rates, which may result in further interest rate increases and lead to increased market volatility; 

our ability to access debt and equity capital to finance our assets; 

current maturities of our financing arrangements and our ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; 

potential exercising of redemption rights by the holders of the Series A Preferred Units; 

local, regional, national, and international economic and credit market conditions; 

recapture of previously issued Low Income Housing Tax Credits LIHTCs in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC );

Item 1. B usiness. 
 Organization 
 The Partnership was formed in 1998 for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds MRBs that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily housing, seniors housing and commercial properties. We also invest in governmental issuer loans GILs ), which are similar to MRBs, to provide construction financing for affordable multifamily properties. We expect and believe the interest received on our MRBs and GILs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate and may make property loans to multifamily properties which may or may not be financed by MRBs or GILs held by us and may or may not be secured by real estate. 
 We also make noncontrolling equity investments in unconsolidated entities for the construction, stabilization, and ultimate sale of market-rate multifamily properties JV Equity Investments ). We are entitled to distributions if, and when, cash is available for distribution either through normal operations, a refinance, or a sale of the property. In addition, we may acquire and hold interests in multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties MF Properties until the highest and best use can be determined by management. 
 The conduct of the Partnership s business and affairs is governed by the Partnership s Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated December 5, 2022 (the Partnership Agreement ). Our sole general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two AFCA 2 or the General Partner ). The general partner of AFCA 2 is Greystone AF Manager LLC Greystone Manager ), which is an affiliate of Greystone Co. II LLC Greystone Co. ). Greystone Co., together with its affiliated companies (collectively Greystone ), is a real estate lending, investment, and advisory company with an established reputation as a leader in multifamily and healthcare finance, having ranked as a top Federal Housing Administration FHA ), Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae ), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac lender in these sectors. 
 The Partnership has issued Beneficial Unit Certificates BUCs representing assigned limited partnership interests to investors BUC holders ). Our BUCs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol GHI. The Partnership has designated three series of non-cumulative, non-voting, non-convertible preferred units (collectively, the Preferred Units that represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership consisting of the Series A Preferred Units, the Series A-1 Preferred Units, and the Series B Preferred Units. There are currently no Series B Preferred Units issued and outstanding. The holders of the BUCs and Preferred Units are referred to herein as Unitholders. Our Unitholders will incur tax liability if any interest earned on our MRBs or GILs is determined to be taxable, for gains related to our MRBs or GILs and for income and gains related to our taxable investments such as our investments in unconsolidated entities and property loans. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Report for additional details. 
 On November 29, 2022, the Partnership filed an Amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the Certificate Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change the name of the Partnership from America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. to Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP. The name change became effective on December 5, 2022. The Certificate Amendment and name change were approved by the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager and did not require the approval of the Partnership s BUC holders. 
 Investment Types 
 Mortgage Revenue Bonds MRBs 
 We invest in MRBs that are issued by state and local governments, their agencies, and authorities to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of income-producing multifamily rental properties. An MRB does not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on an MRB. An MRB is a non-recourse obligation of the property owner. Each MRB is collateralized by a mortgage on all real and personal property of the secured property, which it may share with a corresponding taxable MRB owned by the Partnership. Typically, the sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on an MRB is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the secured property. We may commit to provide funding for MRBs on a draw-down basis during construction and/or rehabilitation of the secured property, and we may require recourse to the borrower during the construction or rehabilitation period in certain instances. 
 We expect and believe that the interest received on our MRBs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We primarily invest in MRBs that are senior obligations of the secured properties, though we may also invest in subordinate MRBs. Our MRBs predominantly bear interest at fixed interest rates and require regular principal and interest payments on either a monthly or semi-annual basis. The majority of our MRBs have initial contractual terms of 15 years or more. MRBs may have optional call dates 
 6 

that may be exercised by the borrower or us that are earlier than the contractual maturity. Such optional calls may be at either par or a premium to par. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we reported 77 MRBs on our consolidated balance sheet with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately 771.0 million. The MRBs are secured by 66 multifamily residential properties containing a total of 10,976 rental units located in 13 states in the United States. One MRB is secured by a mortgage on the ground, facilities, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility in Tennessee. One MRB is secured by a mortgage on the ground, facilities, and equipment of a seniors housing property currently under construction in Michigan. Our MRBs are either owned directly by us or are held in trusts created in connection with debt financing transactions that are consolidated VIEs. 
 The four types of MRBs which we may acquire as investments are as follows: 
 Private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code IRC ); 

Bonds issued under Section 145 of the IRC on behalf of not-for-profit entities qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC; 

Essential function bonds issued by a public instrumentality to finance a multifamily residential property owned by such instrumentality; and 

Existing 80/20 bonds that were issued under Section 103(b)(4)(A) of the IRC. 

Each of these structures permit the issuance of MRBs under the IRC to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with tax-exempt MRBs (other than essential function bonds as described in the third bullet above) must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area. Those rental units of the multifamily residential project not subject to tenant income restrictions may be rented at market rates (unless there are restrictions otherwise imposed by the bond issuer or a governmental entity). With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the IRC, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the MRBs are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20 of the units for tenants making less than 50 of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40 of the units for tenants making less than 60 of the area median income (as adjusted for household size). State and local housing authorities may require additional tenant income or rent restrictions that are more restrictive than those required by Treasury Regulations. There are no Treasury Regulations related to MRBs that are secured by a commercial property owned by a non-profit borrower. 
 The borrowers associated with our MRBs are either syndicated partnerships formed to receive allocations of LIHTCs or not-for-profit entities. We do not directly or indirectly invest in LIHTCs but invest in MRBs that are issued in association with federal LIHTC allocations because such MRBs bear interest that we expect and believe is exempt from federal income taxes. LIHTC-eligible projects are attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing. Under the LIHTC program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing. To be eligible for federal LIHTCs, a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated, and therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term as compared to an older property. There are various requirements to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions, which vary by property. Our borrowers that are either non-profit entities or owned by non-profit entities typically have missions to provide affordable multifamily rental units to underserved populations in their market areas. The affordable housing properties securing 501(c)(3) bonds also must comply with the IRS safe harbors for tenant incomes and rents. The following table summarizes the amount of our MRB investments with LIHTC-associated borrowers and non-profit borrowers based on principal outstanding as of December 31, 2022:

We may also invest in taxable MRBs secured by the same properties as our MRBs. Interest earned on our taxable MRBs is taxable for federal income tax purposes. Our taxable MRBs may share senior mortgage interest in the property with the MRBs or may be subordinate to the MRBs. 
 Governmental Issuer Loans GILs 
 We invest in governmental issuer loans GILs that are issued by state or local governmental authorities to finance the construction of affordable multifamily properties. A GIL does not constitute an obligation of any government, agency or authority and 
 7 

no government, agency or authority is liable for them, nor is the taxing power of any government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the GIL. Each GIL is secured by a mortgage on all real and personal property of the to-be-constructed affordable multifamily property. The GILs may share first mortgage lien positions with property loans and/or taxable GILs also owned by us. Sources of the funds to pay principal and interest on a GIL consist of the net cash flow of the secured property, proceeds from the sale or refinancing of the secured property, and limited-to-full payment guaranties provided by affiliates of the borrower. We typically commit to fund our GIL investment commitments on a draw-down basis during construction. 
 We expect and believe the interest earned on our GILs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The GILs are senior obligations of the secured properties and bear interest at variable interest rates. The GILs have initial terms of two to four years, though the borrower typically may prepay all amounts due at any time without penalty. At the closing of each GIL, Freddie Mac, through a servicer, has forward committed to purchase the GIL at maturity at par if and when the property has reached stabilization and other conditions are met. Upon stabilization, the servicer will purchase our GIL at par and then immediately sell the GIL to Freddie Mac pursuant to a financing commitment between the servicer and Freddie Mac. As of December 31, 2022, the servicer for eleven of our GILs is an affiliate of Greystone. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we reported 13 GILs on our consolidated balance sheet with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately 300.2 million. In addition, we had remaining funding commitments of 103.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Such GILs are secured by 13 affordable multifamily properties containing a total of 2,419 rental units located in six states in the United States. All our GILs are held in trusts created in connection with debt financing transactions that are consolidated VIEs. 
 Our GILs have been issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code IRC and are subject to the same set aside and tenant income restrictions noted in the Mortgage Revenue Bonds description above. The borrowers associated with our GILs are syndicated partnerships formed to receive allocations of LIHTCs. 
 JV Equity Investments 
 We invest in non-controlling membership interests in unconsolidated entities for the construction of market-rate multifamily real estate properties. Our JV Equity Investments are passive in nature. Operational oversight of each property is controlled by our joint venture partner according to the entity s operating agreement. All properties are managed by a property management company affiliated with our joint venture partner. Decisions on when to sell an individual property are made by our joint venture partner based on its view of the local market conditions and current leasing trends. 
 We account for our JV Equity Investments using the equity method and recognize a preferred return on our contributed equity during the hold period. The accrued preferred return for our JV Equity Investments held through our wholly owned subsidiary, ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC (the Vantage JV Equity Investments ), is guaranteed by an unrelated third party through the fifth anniversary of construction commencement up to a certain dollar amount on an individual project basis. 
 Our ownership of the membership interests entitles us to shares of certain cash flows generated by the JV Equity Investments from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinancing or sale. Upon the sale of a property, net proceeds will be distributed according to the entity operating agreement. Sales proceeds distributed to us that represent previously unrecognized preferred return and gain on sale are recognized as income upon receipt. Historically, the majority of our income from our JV Equity Investments has been recognized at the time of sale. As a result, we may experience significant income recognition in those quarters when a property is sold and our equity investment is redeemed. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned membership interests in 11 unconsolidated entities located in three states in the United States. Seven of the 11 JV Equity Investments are located in Texas. In addition, one JV Equity Investment in San Marcos, Texas is reported as a consolidated VIE. 
 8 

MF Properties Segment 
 The Partnership has and may acquire controlling interests in multifamily, student or senior citizen residential properties. We operate the MF Properties in order to position ourselves for a future investment in MRBs issued to finance the acquisition and/or rehabilitation of the properties by new owners or until the opportunity arises to sell the MF Properties at what we believe is their optimal fair value. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned one MF Property, the Suites on Paseo, containing a total of 384 rental units located in California. 
 Property Loans 
 We also invest in property loans to finance the construction, finance capital improvements, or otherwise support property operations of multifamily residential properties. Multifamily residential properties financed with property loans may or may not be properties securing our MRB and GIL investments. Such property loans may be secured by property, other collateral, or may be unsecured. 
 General Investment Matters 
 Our investments are categorized as either Mortgage Investments, Tax Exempt Investments or Other Investments as defined in our Partnership Agreement. Mortgage Investments, as defined, consist of MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans to borrowers associated with our MRBs and GILs. Tax Exempt Investments, as defined, are securities, other than Mortgage Investments, for which the related interest income is exempt from federal income taxation and must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Other Investments, as defined, are generally all other investments that are not Mortgage Investments or Tax Exempt Investments. We may acquire additional Tax Exempt Investments and Other Investments provided that the acquisition may not cause the aggregate book value of all Tax Exempt Investments plus Other Investments to exceed 25 of our total assets at the time of acquisition. We currently own no Tax Exempt Investments as of December 31, 2022. Our Other Investments primarily consist of MF Properties, other real estate assets, JV Equity Investments and certain property loans as of December 31, 2022. 
 We rely on an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which has certain restrictions on the types and amounts of securities owned by the Partnership. See the Regulatory Matters section included within this Item 1 below for further information. 
 Business Objectives and Strategy 
 Investment Strategy 
 Our primary business objective is to manage our portfolio of investment to achieve the following: 
 Generate attractive, risk-adjusted total returns for our Unitholders; 

Create streams of recurring income to support regular cash distributions to Unitholders; 

Pass through tax-advantaged income to Unitholders; 

Generate income from capital gains on asset dispositions; 

Use leverage effectively to increase returns on our investments; and 

Preserve and protect Partnership assets. 

We are pursuing a strategy of acquiring additional MRBs, GILs and other investments on a leveraged basis to achieve our objective, as permitted by our Partnership Agreement. In allocating our capital and executing our strategy, we seek to balance the risks of owning specific investments with the earnings opportunity on the investment. 
 The Partnership believes there continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily and seniors residential housing in the United States. Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents have not kept up with demand. Therefore, investment programs that promote private sector development and support for affordable housing through MRBs, GILs, tax credits and grant funding to developers, have become more prominent. The types of MRBs and GILs in which we invest offer developers of affordable multifamily housing a low-cost source of construction and/or permanent debt financing. We plan to continue investing in additional MRBs and GILs issued to finance affordable multifamily and seniors residential rental housing properties. 
 9 

We continue to evaluate opportunities for MRB investments to fund seniors housing properties and/or skilled nursing properties issued as private activity or 501(c)(3) bonds similar in legal structure to those issued for traditional affordable multifamily housing properties. We will continue to leverage the expertise of Greystone and its affiliates and other reputable third parties in evaluating independent living, assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing properties prior to our MRB acquisitions. During 2021, we acquired our first senior citizen housing MRB, Meadow Valley, that will finance the construction and stabilization of a combined independent living, assisted living and memory care facility in Traverse City, MI. 
 We continually assess opportunities to expand and/or reposition our existing portfolio of MRBs, GILs and other investments. Our principal objective is to improve the quality and performance of our portfolio of MRBs, GILs and other investments with the intent to ultimately increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders. In certain circumstances, we may allow the borrowers of our MRBs to redeem the MRBs prior to the final maturity date. Such MRB redemptions will usually require a sale or refinancing of the underlying property. We may also elect to sell MRBs that have experienced significant appreciation in value. In other cases, we may elect to sell MRBs on properties that are in stagnant or declining real estate markets. The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives. We anticipate holding our GILs until maturity as the terms are typically for two to four years and have defined forward purchase commitments from Freddie Mac, acting through a servicer. 
 We also continue to make additional strategic JV Equity Investments for the development of market-rate multifamily residential properties, through noncontrolling membership interests. We are also evaluating potential JV Equity Investments for the development of market-rate seniors housing properties. We believe such equity investments diversify our investment portfolio while also providing attractive risk-adjusted returns for our Unitholders. 
 Financing Strategy 
 We finance our assets with what we believe to be a prudent amount of leverage, the level of which varies from time to time based upon the characteristics of our investment portfolio, availability of financing, cost of financing, and market conditions. This leverage strategy allows us to generate enhanced returns and lowers our net capital investment, allowing us to make additional investments. We currently obtain leverage on our investments and assets through various sources that include: 
 Our secured line of credit facilities with BankUnited, N.A. and Bankers Trust Company; 

Tax-Exempt Bond Securitization TEBS programs with Freddie Mac; 

Tender Option Bond TOB trust securitizations with Mizuho Capital Markets Mizuho and Barclays Bank PLC Barclays ); 

Term TOB trust securitizations with Morgan Stanley; and 

Secured notes Secured Notes issued to Mizuho. 

We may utilize other types of secured or unsecured borrowings in the future, including more complex financing structures and diversification of our leverage sources and counterparties. 
 We refer to our TEBS, TOB trust, and term TOB trust securitizations and our Secured Notes as our debt financings. The TEBS, TOB trust and term TOB trust securitizations are accounted for as consolidated VIEs for reporting purposes. These arrangements are structured such that we transfer our investment assets to an entity, such as a trust or special purpose entity, which then issues senior securities and residual interests. The senior securities are sold to third-party investors in exchange for debt proceeds. We retain the residual interests which entitle us to certain rights to the investment assets and to residual cash proceeds. We generally structure our debt financings such that principal, interest, and any trust expenses are payable from the cash flows of the secured investment assets, and we are generally entitled to all residual cash flows for our general use. As the residual interest holder, we may be required to make certain payments or contribute certain assets to the VIEs if certain events occur. Such events include, but are not limited to, a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities issued by the VIEs, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the VIEs, increases in short term interest rates beyond pre-set maximums, an inability to re-market the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity support for the senior securities. If such an event occurs in an individual VIE, we may be required to deleverage the VIE by repurchasing some or all of the senior securities. Otherwise, the secured investment asset will be sold and we will be required to fund any shortfall in funds available to pay the principal amount of the senior securities after payment of accrued interest and other trust expenses. If we do not fund the shortfall, default and liquidation provisions will be invoked against us. Each of the TEBS financings are non-recourse to the Partnership such that our shortfall funding for each TEBS financing is limited to the stated amount of our residual interests. The TOB trust and term TOB trust financings are recourse obligations of the Partnership. 
 The TOB trusts and Secured Notes with Mizuho and the TOB trust with Barclays are subject to ISDA master agreements with each counterparty that contain certain covenants and requirements. The TOB trust financings with Mizuho and Barclays require that the Partnership's residual interests in each TOB trust maintain a certain value in relation to total assets in each TOB trust. The Mizuho and 
 10 

Barclays ISDA master agreements also require the Partnership s partners capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold and that the BUCs remain listed on a national securities exchange. The ISDA master agreement with Barclays also puts limits on the Partnership s Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Partnership below). In addition, both the Mizuho and Barclays ISDA master agreements specify that default(s) on the Partnership s other senior debts above a specified dollar amount, in the aggregate, will constitute a default under such agreement. If the Partnership is not in compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facilities would be triggered. 
 We may also be required to post collateral, typically cash, related to the TOB trust financings under the terms of the ISDA master agreements with Mizuho and Barclays. The amount of collateral posting required is dependent on the valuation of the securitized assets and any interest rate swap entered into as a hedge in relation to certain thresholds set by Mizuho and Barclays. 
 The willingness of leverage providers to extend financing is dependent on various factors such as their underwriting standards, regulatory requirements, available lending capacity, and existing credit exposure to the Partnership. An inability to access debt financing at an acceptable cost may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of MRBs, GILs and other investments through additional debt financings. 
 We set target constraints for each type of debt financing utilized. Those constraints are dependent upon several factors, including the investment assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to mark-to-market based collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financed assets. The Board of Managers of Greystone Manager establishes an overall maximum leverage level (the Leverage Ratio and retains the right to change the Leverage Ratio in the future based on the consideration of factors the Board of Managers considers relevant. In February 2023, the Board of Managers approved an increase in the maximum leverage ratio from 75 to 80 . We calculate our Leverage Ratio as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using cost (adjusted for paydowns) for MRBs, GILs, property loans, taxable MRBs and taxable GILs, and initial cost for deferred financing costs and real estate assets. As of December 31, 2022, our overall Leverage Ratio was approximately 73 . 
 Hedging Strategy 
 We actively manage both our fixed and variable rate debt financings and our exposure to changes in market interest rates. When possible, we attempt to obtain fixed-rate debt financing for our fixed-rate investment assets such that our net interest spread is not exposed to changes in market interest rates. Similarly, we attempt to obtain variable-rate debt financing for our variable-rate investment assets such that we are largely hedged against rising interest rates without the need for separate hedging instruments. 
 We leverage certain fixed-rate investment assets with variable-rate debt financings, such as the TOB trusts, Secured Notes and one TEBS financing. When deemed appropriate, we will enter into derivative based hedging transactions in connection with our risk management activities for these assets to hedge against rising interest rates, which may include interest rate caps, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, swaptions, futures, options or other available hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2022, we held interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling 194.7 million and one interest rate cap with a notional amount of 75.0 million. 
 Preferred Units and BUCs Issuances 
 In addition to leverage, we may obtain additional capital through the issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units or other Partnership securities which may be issued in, among other things, one or more additional series of preferred units, and/or BUCs. We filed a registration statement on Form S-3 for the registration of up to 3,500,000 of Series A-1 Preferred Units, which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 9, 2021, and subsequently amended pursuant to a Post-Effective Amendment to the Form S-3, which was declared effective by the Commission on April 13, 2022. The Series A-1 Preferred Units are subject to optional redemption by the holder upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series A-1 Preferred Units and the holders are entitled to distributions at a fixed rate of 3.0 per annum. The Partnership is able to issue Series A-1 Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series A-1 Preferred Units, is no less than three times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. As of December 31, 2022, we have not issued any Series A-1 Preferred Units under the registration statement on Form S-3. 
 In addition, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 for the registration of up to 10,000,000 of Series B Preferred Units, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 9, 2021, and subsequently amended pursuant to a Post-Effective Amendment to the Form S-3, which was declared effective by the Commission on April 13, 2022. The Series B Preferred Units are subject to optional redemption by the holder upon the eighth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series B Preferred Units and the holders are entitled to distributions at a fixed rate of 3.4 per annum. The Partnership is able to issue Series B Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series B Preferred Units, is no less than two times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. We have not yet issued any Series B Preferred Units as of December 31, 2022. 
 11 

We have previously issued Series A Preferred Units totaling 94.5 million. The Series A Preferred Units are subject to optional redemption by the holder upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series A Preferred Units and the holders are entitled to distributions at a fixed rate of 3.0 per annum. We filed a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offering and issuance of up to 9,450,000 of Series A-1 Preferred Units under a shelf registration process that was declared effective by the SEC on July 6, 2021, and subsequently amended pursuant to a Post-Effective Amendment to the Form S-4, which was declared effective by the Commission on April 13, 2022. Under this offering, the Partnership may issue up to 9,450,000 Series A-1 Preferred Units in exchange for the Partnership s outstanding Series A Preferred Units. If unitholders elect to exchange Series A Preferred Units for Series A-1 Preferred Units, the new Series A-1 Preferred Units will not be eligible for redemption until the sixth anniversary of the date of the exchange, except in certain limited circumstances. During 2022, two Series A Preferred Unit holders elected to exchange 3,000,000 existing Series A Preferred Units for 3,000,000 newly issued Series A-1 Preferred Units. As of December 31, 2022, we had 6,450,000 Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding. 
 We may also obtain capital through the issuance of additional BUCs, Preferred Units or debt securities pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 Registration Statement ), which was declared effective by the SEC in December 2022. Under the Registration Statement we may offer up to 300.0 million of BUCs, Preferred Units or debt securities for sale from time to time. The Registration Statement will expire in December 2025. 
 In July 2021, we entered into a Capital on Demand TM Sales Agreement to offer and sell, from time to time at market prices on the date of sale, BUCs up to an aggregate offering price of 30 million via an at the market offering. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any BUCs under this program. We will continue to assess if and when to issue BUCs under this program going forward. 
 Reportable Segments 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had four reportable segments: (1) Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments, (2) Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments, (3) Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments, and (4) MF Properties. The Partnership separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments. 
 Competition 
 We compete with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and other entities with objectives similar to ours for the acquisition of MRBs, GILs and other investments. These competitors often have greater access to capital and can originate investments with interest rates and terms that do not meet our return requirements. This competition may reduce the availability of investments for acquisition and may reduce the interest rate that issuers are willing to pay on our future investments. 
 Through our various investments, we may be in competition with other real estate investments in the same geographic areas. Multifamily residential rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants. To compete effectively, the properties underlying our investments must offer quality rental units at competitive rental rates. To maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the properties may offer rental concessions, such as reduced rent to new tenants for a stated period. These properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages, services and pleasant landscaping.

Regulatory Matters 
 We conduct our operations in reliance on an exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). In this regard, we believe that we and our wholly owned subsidiaries will not be considered investment companies under either Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is not deemed to be an investment company if it neither is, nor holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, nor proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is not deemed to be an investment company if it neither is engaged, nor proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. For these purposes, investment securities excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company for private funds under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. In addition, we and our wholly owned subsidiaries operate our business under an exclusion from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the SEC staff, a company is required to invest at least 55 of its assets in mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, and other real estate-related interests, which are deemed to be qualifying interests, and at least 80 of its assets in qualifying interests plus a broader category of real estate-related assets in order to qualify for this exception. We monitor our compliance with the foregoing provisions and the holdings of our subsidiaries to ensure that we and each of our subsidiaries are in compliance with an applicable exemption or exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We believe each of the properties related to our investment assets comply, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters. We are not aware of any environmental contamination at any of these properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof. 
 Management 
 We are managed by our General Partner, AFCA 2, which is controlled by its general partner, Greystone Manager. The members of the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager act as the managers (and effectively as the directors) of the Partnership, in compliance with all NYSE listing rules and SEC rules applicable to the Partnership. In addition, certain employees of Greystone Manager act as executive officers of the Partnership. Certain services are provided to the Partnership by employees of Greystone Manager and the Partnership reimburses Greystone Manager for its allocated share of their salaries and benefits. The Partnership s initial limited partner, which has the obligation to perform certain actions on behalf of the BUC holders under the Partnership Agreement, is Greystone ILP, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 
 AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45 per annum of the average outstanding principal balance of any MRBs, GILs, property loans, Tax Exempt Investments or Other Investments for which an unaffiliated party is not obligated to pay. When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all interest due to us for the MRB, GIL or property loan associated with the property. The Partnership Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by us with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that we will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed MRBs. 
 AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage and investment placement fees resulting from the identification and evaluation of additional investments that are acquired by the Partnership. Any fees related to the origination of our investment assets are paid by the property owner. The fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2 and such property owners. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership had no employees. Fourteen employees of Greystone Manager are responsible for the Partnership s operations, inclusive of the Partnership s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Such employees are subject to the policies and compensation practices of Greystone. 
 Greystone has implemented evaluation and compensation policies designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees that provide services to the Partnership to achieve superior results. Such policies are designed to balance both short-term and long-term performance of the Partnership. Annual incentive compensation is based on defined performance metrics and certain employees earn discretionary bonuses based upon various quantitative and qualitative metrics. Employees providing services to the Partnership are eligible for awards under the Amended and Restated Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ), which is designed to provide incentive compensation awards that encourage superior performance. The Plan is also intended to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential for the Partnership s growth and profitability and to encourage those individuals to devote their 
 15 

best efforts to advancing the Partnership s business. Greystone also supports employees with an annual confidential employee survey, Employee Assistance Program and ethics hotline. 
 Greystone provides formal and informal training programs to enhance the skills of employees providing services to the Partnership and to instill Greystone s corporate policies and practices. The Partnership also reimburses the cost of formal training for those programs that are directly related to the tasks and responsibilities of the employees related to operations of the Partnership. 
 Greystone and the Partnership are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion DEI ). Specific Greystone DEI initiatives include formal diversity training and employee resources groups to support a diverse workforce as well as a formal DEI committee and DEI Leadership Council to lead and advise all DEI related work, events, and learning. Of the 14 employees of Greystone Manager responsible for the Partnership s operations, three are women and one employee identifies as ethnically diverse. 
 Greystone Manager is responsible for filling open positions as it relates to the Partnership and considers both internal and external candidates. Greystone Manager may contract with third party search firms to identify candidates for open positions as needed. 
 Tax Status 
 We are a partnership for federal income tax purposes. This means that we do not pay federal income taxes on our income. Instead, our profits and losses are allocated to our partners, including the holders of Preferred Units, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The distributive share of income, deductions and credits is reported to our Unitholders on Internal Revenue Service IRS Schedule K-1 and Unitholders should include such amount in their respective federal and state income tax returns. 
 We hold certain property loans through a wholly owned subsidiary that is a C corporation for income tax purposes. This subsidiary files separate federal and state income tax returns and is subject to federal and state income taxes. 
 We consolidate separate legal entities that record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. We do not believe the consolidation of these entities for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP will impact our tax status, amounts reported to Unitholders on IRS Schedule K-1, our ability to distribute income to Unitholders that we believe is tax-exempt or the current level of quarterly distributions. 
 All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, with the exception of identified Non-GAAP information disclosed in Item 7 of this Report. 
 General Information

Risks Related to our Business and Investments 
 We are managed by our general partner and engage in transactions with related parties. 
 The Partnership is managed by its sole general partner, which is controlled by affiliates of Greystone. In addition, employees of Greystone Manager are responsible for the Partnership s operations, including the Partnership s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. The Partnership s general partner manages our investments, performs administrative services for us and earns administrative fees that are paid by either the borrowers related to our MRBs, GILs or by us, subject to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The general partner does not have a fiduciary duty or obligation to any limited partner or BUC holder. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the activities of the Partnership and Greystone and its affiliates by virtue of the fact that the general partner is controlled by Greystone. The general partner may be removed by a vote of limited partners holding at least 66.7 of outstanding limited partnership interests, voting as a single class. Such removal shall be effective immediately following the admission of a successor general partner. 
 We may also enter into various arrangements for services provided by entities controlled by or affiliates of Greystone. Our arrangements with Greystone and its affiliates are considered related party transactions. By their nature, related party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm s length. These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Greystone or its affiliates. See Note 22 of the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Downgrades by rating agencies of the U.S. government s credit rating or concerns about its debt and deficit levels in general, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with our investment portfolio and our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. Interest rates have risen in recent months, and the risk that they may continue to do so is pronounced. In addition, a decreased U.S. government credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may weigh heavily on our financial performance and the market value of our BUCs. 
 The current global financial market situation, as well as various social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world, including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, adverse effects of climate crisis and global health epidemics, may contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. In particular, the consequences of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, including comprehensive international sanctions, the impact on inflation and increased disruption to supply chains may impact our counterparties with which we do business, and specifically our financing counterparties and financial institutions from which we obtain financing for the purchase of our MRBs, GILs, and other investments, result in an economic downturn or recession either globally or locally in the U.S. or other economies, reduce business activity, spawn additional conflicts (whether in the form of traditional military action, reignited cold wars or in the form of virtual warfare such as cyberattacks) with similar and perhaps wider ranging impacts and consequences and have an adverse impact on the Partnership s returns, net income, and Cash Available for Distribution CAD ). We have no way to predict the duration or outcome of the situation, as the conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, military activities, or broad-based sanctions may increase our funding costs or limit our access to the capital markets. 
 Additionally, the U.S. government s debt and deficit concerns, the European geopolitical and economic environment, and any continuing macroeconomic uncertainty with respect to China could cause interest rates to be volatile, which may negatively impact our ability to obtain debt financing on favorable terms. In this period of rising interest rates, our cost of funds may increase except to the extent we have obtained fixed rate debt, issued Preferred Units with a fixed distribution rate, or sufficiently hedged our interest rate risk, which hedging could reduce our net income and CAD. 
 We are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment, and changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and, consequently, our net income and CAD. 
 In 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates by a total of 4.25 and has suggested additional interest rate increases may be possible. Changing interest rates may have unpredictable effects on markets, may result in heightened market volatility and may detract from our performance to the extent we are exposed to such interest rate increases and/or volatility. In periods of rising interest rates, such as the current interest rate environment, to the extent we borrow money subject to a variable interest rate, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net income. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with variable interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates (such as a London Interbank Bank Offering Rate LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR floor, as applicable), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to variable interest rates not subject to such minimums. In such a scenario, rising 
 19 

interest rates may increase our interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates. 
 A further increase in interest rates during this period of rising interest rates may make it more costly for us to service the debt under our financing arrangements. Rising interest rates could also cause the developers of the projects we finance through MRBs, GILs, and property loans to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to delays in construction, leasing and stabilization of properties, and corresponding increased defaults. Properties securing our MRB, GIL and property loan investments that have variable interest rates may also experience higher construction costs that may exceed established capitalized interest reserves and other contingency reserves, potentially resulting in shortfalls in contractual debt service payments. Similarly, our JV Equity Investments have variable-rate construction loans and have established capitalized interest reserves during construction. Higher interest rates may result in higher than anticipated construction costs, resulting in ultimately lower amounts available for distribution during the operating period and upon sale. 
 We finance the purchase of a significant portion of our investment assets, including our purchases of MRBs and GILs. As a result, our net income and CAD will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the yields on our investments in those instruments. If debt financing is unavailable at acceptable rates, we may not be able to purchase and finance additional investments at an acceptable levered return. If we have previously financed the acquisition of an investment, we may be unable to refinance such debt at maturity or may be unable to refinance at acceptable terms. If we refinance our debt at higher rates of interest, our interest expense will increase and our cash flows from operations will be reduced. We can offer no assurance that continued significant changes in market interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our net income and CAD. In this period of rising interest rates, our cost of funds may further increase, which could reduce our net income and CAD. 
 We are subject to risks related to inflation. 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value or purchasing power of money. Inflation rates may change frequently and significantly as a result of various factors, including unexpected shifts in the domestic or global economy and changes in economic policies. The yields on our investments may not keep pace with inflation, which may result in losses to our unitholders. This risk is greater for fixed-income investments with longer maturities. 
 Inflation could cause increases in our general and administrative costs causing a decrease in our operating cash flows. Inflation may also increase the operating expenses for multifamily properties underlying our investment assets. Such cost increases may result in lower debt service coverage for properties related to our MRB, GIL and property loan investments. Such cost increases may result in less distributable operating cash from our JV Equity Investments and may also result in lower property sales prices causing a reduction in distributions upon capital events. The majority of tenant leases related to various investment assets are for terms of one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent such properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses. Rental rates for set-aside units at affordable multifamily properties are typically tied to certain percentages of the area median income. Increases in area median income are not necessarily correlated to increases in property operating expenses. A significant mismatch between area median income growth and property operating expense increases could negatively impact net operating cash flows available to pay debt service. 
 Inflation may cause increases in construction costs for properties under construction that secure our MRB and GIL investments. Our borrowers typically enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts at closing to mitigate potential increases in construction costs. However, change orders and general costs increases could be impacted by inflation and cause cost overruns that negatively impact property performance. Inflation may increase the interest rate of our GILs, certain MRBs and property loans, increasing the cost of construction. Each property has established capitalized interest reserves as part of the construction financing structure, but such reserves may be insufficient if the interest rate is significantly higher than anticipated and may cause cost overruns, which could negatively impact the borrower s ability to make contractual debt service payments. 
 Inflation typically is accompanied by higher interest rates, which could adversely impact borrowers ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby causing a decrease in the number of MRBs, GILs and property loan investment opportunities. In addition, during any periods of rising inflation, interest rates on our variable rate debt financing arrangements would likely increase, which would tend to further reduce returns to Unitholders. Higher interest rates due to inflation may also depress investment asset values due to a decrease in demand or increasing cost of operations, such that we may record charges against earnings for asset impairments that may be material. 
 Our investment assets are generally illiquid and our valuation estimates are subject to inherent uncertainty. 
 Our investment assets are relatively illiquid as there are no existing trading markets for them. There are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed secondary trading market for these investments. In addition, no rating has been issued on any of our investment assets. Accordingly, any buyer of these investment assets would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase. Our ability to sell investment assets and the price we may receive upon sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, 
 20 

the number of similar securities on the market at the time and by other market conditions. As a result, a sale of an investment could result in a loss to the Partnership. 
 We estimate values of our investment assets in the preparation of our financial statements. While the determination of the fair value of our investment assets generally takes into consideration data from third-party pricing services or internally developed models using commonly accepted valuation techniques, the final determination of fair values for our investment assets is based on our judgment, and such valuations may differ from those provided by other pricing services and the true exit price for such investments. Due to the illiquid nature of our investments, valuations may be difficult to obtain, may not be reliable, or may be sensitive to assumptions used in our valuation processes. Depending on the complexity and illiquidity of an asset, valuations of the same asset can vary substantially from one market participant to another. Our results of operations, financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected if our fair value determinations of these assets are materially higher than what could actually be realized in the market. 
 The market value of our investment assets may be adversely impacted by increasing interest rates. 
 In general, the valuation of our investment assets with fixed interest rates is dependent on the relation of the stated interest rate to the market interest rate for similar assets. Increasing market interest rates will generally result in declining investment asset valuations, which may decrease the amount realized on the sale of our investments or the amount of debt financing that can be obtained from lenders, each resulting in lower returns on our investment assets. 
 The receipt of contractual interest and principal payments on our MRBs, GILs and property loans will be affected by the economic results of the secured properties. 
 Our MRBs require the borrower to make regular principal and interest payments during their contractual term. Although our MRBs are issued by state or local governments, their agencies, and authorities, they are not general obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority. Instead, each MRB is backed by a non-recourse obligation of the owner of the secured property. Because of the non-recourse nature, the sole source of cash to make regular principal and interest on the MRB is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the secured property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property (except in cases where a property owner or its affiliates has provided a limited guaranty of certain payments). This makes our investments in these MRBs subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in such properties. If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our MRB, a default may occur. Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a property are applied only to debt service payments of the MRB secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other MRBs that we hold. In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability. Therefore, the amount of interest that we earn on our MRBs, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the MRBs as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the secured properties. 
 Our GILs and related property loans require regular interest payments during their contractual term. Although our GILs are issued by state or local governments, their agencies, and authorities, they are not general obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority. Instead, each GIL is a non-recourse obligation of the owner of the secured property. In addition, the property loans related to properties securing our GILs are on parity with the related GILs and share a first mortgage lien position on all real and personal property. Contractual interest payments during the contractual term are initially paid using capitalized interest in the property s development budget. However, once the capitalized interest has been exhausted for each property, interest is payable from net operating cash flows of the secured property, which is dependent to a large degree on the property s operating results. 
 The net cash flow from the operation of a multifamily property may be affected by many factors, such as the number of tenants, rental and fee rates, payroll costs, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other similar multifamily or student residential properties, mortgage rates for single-family housing, adverse developments or conditions resulting from or associated with climate change, and general and local economic conditions. In most of the markets in which the properties securing our investment assets are located, there is significant competition from other multifamily and single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants. Lower mortgage interest rates and federal tax deductions for interest and real estate taxes make single-family home ownership more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments. 
 The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties securing our MRBs and GILs may limit the revenues of such properties. 
 Properties securing our MRB and GIL investments are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants. Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, tenant rents are limited in the LIHTC properties to 30 of the related tenant income for the designated portion of the property s units. The issuing state or local government, agency or authority may also impose additional rent restrictions as a condition to the allocation of LIHTCs and private activity bond volume cap. As a result, the income from these restricted rents in combination with rents on market rate units may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs of the property and debt service on the applicable MRB or GIL investment. 
 21 

There are risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the MRBs, GILs and property loans secured by these properties. 
 We acquire MRBs, GILs and property loans to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation. As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase. The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk of default versus investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased. The properties may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels. While we may require owners and their affiliates to provide certain payment guaranties during the construction and lease-up phases, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guaranties may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased to an adequate level of rents or economic occupancy as anticipated. In addition, Freddie Mac, through a servicer, has forward committed to purchase our GILs at maturity at par if the property has reached stabilization and other conditions are met. If the lease-up of the related properties is either not completed on schedule or rent levels are less than anticipated, then proceeds from Freddie Mac may be less than anticipated or may not meet the conditions for execution of the commitment. In such instances, we will pursue enforcement of payment guaranties from owners and their affiliates. 
 The repayment of principal of our MRBs, GILs, and property loans is principally dependent upon proceeds from the sale or refinancing of the secured properties. 
 The principal balance of most of our MRBs does not fully amortize by their stated maturity dates such that there is a lump-sum balloon payment due at maturity. The ability of the property owners to repay the MRBs with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our MRBs or obtain adequate refinancing proceeds. The MRBs are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these MRBs for collection. Accordingly, if an MRB goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property. If the value of the underlying property securing the MRB is less than the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest on the MRB, we will incur a loss. 
 Our GILs and related property loans require interest only payments during their contractual term, so all principal will be repaid at the end of the contractual term. The GILs are primarily repaid through a conversion to permanent financing pursuant to a forward commitment from Freddie Mac, through a Freddie Mac-approved seller/servicer. Freddie Mac will purchase each of our GILs once certain conditions are met, at a price equal to the outstanding principal plus accrued interest and convert the GIL into a Freddie Mac Tax Exempt Loan TEL financing. The execution of Freddie Mac s forward commitments is dependent on completion of construction and various other conditions that each property must meet. If such conditions are not met, then Freddie Mac is not required to purchase the GIL and we will pursue collection via other means. Alternatively, Freddie Mac may purchase the GIL at a value lower than par, which would then require the borrower to use additional sources to repay the principal on our GIL investment. The property loans related to our GILs are primarily to be repaid from future equity contributions by investors and other forward financing commitments provided by various parties. If Freddie Mac is not required to purchase the GIL and payment of the property loans from available sources is not made, the GIL and property loan will have defaulted and our recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property. We will also enforce our available recourse guaranty provisions against affiliates of the borrower. If the value of the property is less than the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest on the GIL and related property loan, and we are unable to recoup any shortfall through enforcement of guaranties against affiliates of the borrower, then we will incur a loss. If there is a default, we are entitled to the borrower's original allocation of LIHTCs, which we can monetize through sales to third party investors. The value of the LIHTCs is dependent on market demand and the underlying properties ability to cover debt service during the permanent financing phase, which is uncertain. 
 We are subject to various risks associated with our MRB and property loan investments secured by seniors housing and skilled nursing properties. 
 We have acquired MRBs and property loans secured by seniors housing and skilled nursing properties. By their nature, such properties have different operational and financial risks than traditional affordable multifamily properties. The financial and operational risks of such properties may negatively impact a property s ability to pay contractual debt service on our MRB or property loan investment. Such differences will also impact the availability and interest rates for debt financing associated with such investments. 
 The net cash flow from the operation of a seniors housing property may be affected by many factors, such as the number of tenants, rental rates, service revenues, payroll costs, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other seniors housing properties, the availability of alternative housing options such as single-family housing, adverse developments or conditions resulting from or associated with climate change, and general and local economic conditions. In most of the markets in which the properties securing our investment assets are located, there is significant competition from other multifamily and single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants. 
 The net cash flow from the operation of a skilled nursing property may be affected by many factors, such as the number of patient care days, patient acuity mix, patient payor mix and insurance reimbursement rates, availability and cost of nurses and staff, costs of care, general operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from similar properties, adverse developments or conditions resulting from or associated with climate change, and general and local economic conditions. Many 
 22 

such properties are reliant on relationships with physician and hospital networks for patient referrals and support, a lack of which could negatively impact operating results. 
 There are various risks associated with our JV Equity Investments. 
 Our JV Equity Investments represent equity investments in entities created to develop, construct and operate market-rate multifamily rental properties. We are entitled to certain distributions under the terms of the property-specific governing documents based on the availability of cash to pay such distributions. The only sources of cash flows for such distributions are either the net cash flows from the operation of the property, the cash proceeds from a sale of the property, or through permanent financing in the form of an MRB or other permanent financing structure. The net cash flow from property operations may be affected by many factors, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, debt service requirements, competition from other similar multifamily rental properties and general and local economic conditions. Sale proceeds are primarily dependent upon the value of a property to prospective buyers at the time of its sale, which may be impacted by, among other factors, the operating results of the property, cap rates, local market conditions and competition, and interest rates on mortgage financing. If there are no net cash flows from operations or insufficient proceeds from a sale or a refinancing event, we are unlikely to receive distributions from our investments and we may be unable to recover our investments in these entities. 
 Our JV Equity Investments are passive in nature with operational oversight of each property controlled by our joint venture partner, as managing member, according to the entity s operating agreement. We have the ability to remove the managing member under certain circumstances under the operating agreements. All properties are managed by a property management company affiliated with our joint venture partner. Decisions on when to sell an individual property are made by our joint venture partner based on its view of the local market conditions and current leasing trends. Due to our non-controlling interest, we have limited influence on the operating policies and procedures for the JV Equity Investments. 
 There are risks related to the construction of properties underlying our investment assets. 
 We invest in MRBs, GILs and property loans secured by new construction or acquisition/rehabilitation multifamily and seniors housing properties, and we make equity investments in entities created to develop, construct and operate market-rate multifamily rental properties. Construction of such properties generally takes 18 to 36 months to complete. There is a risk that construction of the properties may be substantially delayed or never completed. This may occur for many reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) availability of construction materials and appliances; (iv) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (v) labor disputes; and (vi) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer. While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guaranties from developers or other parties, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases, or such guaranties or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed. In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered. 
 If a property is not completed on time or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the MRB, GIL and/or property loan secured by such property or otherwise result in a default. In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our MRB, GIL and/or property loan investments, resulting in losses. Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or a property loan. Any return on these additional investments would be taxable. Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the MRB, GIL and/or property loan secured by the property. The overall return to us from our investment in this circumstance is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget. 
 As it relates to our JV Equity Investments, if a property is not completed or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive a lower distribution than expected. Furthermore, we may be prevented from receiving a return on our investments or recovering our initial investment, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Conditions in the low income housing tax credit markets due to known or potential changes in U.S. corporate tax rates may increase our cost of borrowing, make financing difficult to obtain or restrict our ability to invest in MRBs and other investments, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. 
 Conditions in the low income housing tax credit market due to changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates have previously had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on our cost of borrowings and may also restrict our ability to invest in MRBs, GILs and other investments. These conditions, as well as the cost and availability of financing has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate. Concern about the stability of the low income housing tax credit markets has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases cease providing, funding to borrowers. Our access to debt financing may be adversely affected. Changes in the U.S. tax rates, and the resulting impacts to the low income housing tax credit market, may limit our ability to 
 23 

replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis, may impair our ability to acquire MRBs, GILs and other investments and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 There are various risks associated with our commitments to fund investments on a draw-down or forward basis. 
 We have committed to advance funds for various investments on a draw-down basis during construction. We may also forward commit to purchase MRBs at a future date, contingent upon stabilization of an affordable multifamily rental property. Our gross outstanding investment commitments were approximately 428.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We believe our liquidity sources and debt financing arrangements are sufficient to fund our current investment commitments over time. However, if circumstances change such that our traditional liquidity sources and debt financing arrangements are insufficient, we may need to obtain funds by other methods, including, but not limited to, alternative financing arrangements, sales of assets, or raise additional capital. This could negatively impact our results of operations through higher costs or lower investment returns. We cannot assure you that we will have access to adequate equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost, advance rates, and term) at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our asset acquisition activities and/or dispose of assets, which could materially adversely affect our operating cash flows and results of operations. 
 If we acquire ownership of properties securing our MRBs, GILs and/or property loans, we will be subject to all the risks normally associated with the ownership of such properties. 
 We may acquire ownership of multifamily, seniors housing or skilled nursing properties securing our MRBs, GILs and property loans in the event of a default, which will subject us to all the risks normally associated with the ownership and operation of such properties. Such risks include, but are not limited to, declines in property values, occupancy and rental rates, increases in operating expenses, and the ability to finance or refinance related debt, if needed. We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters, and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results, cash flows and our ability to sell the properties. 
 Properties related to our MRBs and JV Equity Investments are geographically concentrated in certain states. 
 The properties securing our MRBs are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, with significant concentrations in Texas, California, and South Carolina. Such concentrations expose us to potentially negative effects of local or regional economic downturns, which could prevent us from collecting principal and interest on our MRBs. 
 Seven of our 11 JV Equity Investments as of December 31, 2022 are related to market-rate multifamily properties in Texas. In addition, one JV Equity Investment for a property in Texas is reported as a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2022. Such concentration exposes us to potentially negative effects of local or regional economic downturns, which could prevent us from realizing returns on our investments and recovery of our investment capital. 
 Our investments in certain asset classes may be concentrated with certain developers and related affiliates. 
 We typically source our investment assets through our relationships with multifamily property developers. There are concentrations with certain developers with our MRB, GIL, property loan, and JV Equity Investment asset classes. The developers and their affiliates typically mange the construction and operations of the underlying properties. Though our investment assets are not cross collateralized with each other, management or other issues with an individual developer or its affiliates may impact multiple investment assets associated with the individual developer, resulting in potential lower debt service coverage, and investment or asset impairments. 
 Recourse guaranties related to our GILs and property loans are concentrated in certain entities. 
 Two entities, which are affiliates of one of our developer relationships, have provided limited-to-full payment guaranties of the principal and interest for nine of our GIL investments and seven property loans. The entities are required to meet certain net worth and liquidity covenants under the terms of the guaranties. However, significant defaults causing enforcement of guaranties against the two entities will negatively impact our ability to enforce our guaranties in the event of multiple defaults on our GIL and property loan investments. 
 There is risk that a third-party developer that has provided guaranties of preferred returns on our Vantage JV Equity Investments may not perform. 
 A third-party guarantor has provided a guaranty of preferred returns on each of our Vantage JV Equity Investments through the fifth anniversary of construction commencement, up to a maximum amount for each investment. If the underlying market-rate multifamily rental properties do not generate sufficient cash proceeds, either through net cash flows from operations or upon a sale event or refinancing, then we are entitled to enforce the guaranty against the guarantor. If the guarantor is unable to perform on the guaranty, 
 24 

we may be prevented from realizing the returns earned on our Vantage JV Equity Investments during the guaranty period, which will result in the recognition of losses. 
 There are risks associated with the financial performance of our MF Property investment. 
 The financial performance of our MF Property investment depends on its rental and occupancy rates and its level of operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which the property is located. This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans. In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor issues, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties. The MF Property is adjacent to a university and serves primarily university students. The further use, implementation, or future expansion of remote or hybrid learning options would have a negative impact on economic occupancy and physical occupancy. We may be in competition with other residential rental properties located in the same geographic area as the MF Property investment. 
 There are additional risks when we make property loans to properties securing our MRBs. 
 The property loans that we make to owners of the properties securing our MRBs are recourse or non-recourse obligations of the property owner and may not be secured by the related property. However, the primary source of principal and interest payments on these property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale or refinancing of these properties after payment of the related MRBs. The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be impacted by many factors as previously discussed. In addition, any payment of principal and interest is subordinate to payment of all principal and interest of the MRB secured by the property. As a result, there is a greater risk of default on a property loan than on the associated MRB. If a property is unable to pay current debt service obligations on its property loan, a default may occur. We may not be able to or do not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a property loan if the property is not in default on the MRB. 
 Our reserves for credit losses are based on estimates and may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We periodically review our MRB, taxable MRB, GIL, taxable GIL and property loan investments for impairment based on currently effective GAAP accounting guidance. The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provisions for credit losses, provisions for loan loss and the related impairment analyses are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. Realized impairments may differ from our current estimates and could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings. Any such impacts could be caused by various factors, including, but not limited to, unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific assets, borrowers, or markets in which our borrowers or their properties are located. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which is effective for the Partnership on January 1, 2023. The standard replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses CECL and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Partnership has determined that the GILs, taxable GILs, property loans, receivables reported within other assets, financial guaranties, financial commitments, and interest receivable related to such assets, will be within the scope of ASU 2016-13 once effective for the Partnership. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and updated quarterly thereafter. This differs from the incurred loss impairment methodology pursuant to GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the CECL model will affect how we determine our allowance for credit losses and will generally require us to increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model will create more volatility in the level of our allowance and provision for credit losses. The increase to our level of allowance for credit losses may affect our results of operations, financial condition, and business. 
 Properties related to our investment assets may not be completely insured against damages from natural disasters. 
 If a property underlying an investment asset was to be damaged by a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, major storm or wildfire, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant, and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property. In addition, the damage to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time. If a property owner does not carry rental interruption insurance, the loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay principal and interest on MRBs, GILs and property loans secured by these properties. In addition, the property owner could also lose their LIHTCs if the property was not repaired. A loss of rental income would also reduce the cash available for our MF Properties and JV Equity Investments to pay us distributions. 
 The properties related to our investment assets may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default or loss on our investment. 
 25 

The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property. Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. We cannot assure that the properties related to our investment assets are or will not be contaminated. The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the MRB, GIL or property loan secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in the property. 
 We are subject to reinvestment risk from maturities and prepayments of our investment assets. 
 Our MRB investments may have optional call dates that may be exercised by either the borrower or the Partnership that are earlier than the contractual maturity at either par or premiums to par. In addition, our GILs and most property loans are prepayable at any time without penalty. Borrowers may choose to redeem our investments if prevailing market interest rates are lower than the interest rate on our investment assets or for other various reasons. During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new interest-bearing assets we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of interest-bearing assets. In order to maintain or grow our investment portfolio size and earnings, we must reinvest repayment proceeds in new investment assets. New investment opportunities may not generate the same leveraged returns as our current investment assets such that our reported operating results may decline over time. We typically source our MRB and GIL investment opportunities through our relationships with multifamily property developers. Though we have a variety of property developer relationships, we cannot assure that such developers will continue to generate additional investment opportunities or that we will be awarded future investment opportunities due to various factors, including but not limited to, investment terms offered by our competitors. 
 Similarly, we are subject to reinvestment risk on the return of capital from redemption of our JV Equity Investments. Our initial equity contributions are returned upon sale of the underlying properties, at which time we will reinvest the capital into new JV Equity Investment or other investments. New investment opportunities may not generate the same returns as our prior investments due to factors including, but not limited to, increasing competition in the development of market-rate multifamily rental properties, rising interest rates and increasing construction costs. Lower returns on new investment opportunities will result in declining operating results over time. The majority of our JV Equity Investments to date have been sourced through the Vantage developer group. During 2022, we closed two JV Equity Investments with the Freestone developer group. The key principals of the Freestone development group were formerly affiliated with the Vantage development group and were closely involved in our 20 Vantage JV Equity Investments to date. We cannot ensure that we will be presented with additional investment opportunities from the Vantage and Freestone development groups in the future, which could negatively impact our ability to redeploy capital or achieve continuing investment returns. We continually evaluate opportunities with other developer groups, but we cannot ensure that such opportunities will materialize or, if identified, result in returns similar to our past JV Equity Investments. 
 The effects of the outbreak and spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease may adversely affect our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is dependent in large part on the willingness and ability of real estate developers to construct and operate the multifamily, seniors housing, skilled nursing and commercial properties securing MRBs, GILs, property loans and other investments. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease may cause severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which may in turn disrupt the business, activities, and operations of properties securing or related to our investments, as well as our business and operations. 
 The spread of a highly contagious disease may cause elevated levels of unemployment or reduced economic output in our market areas and has or will cause financial hardship for tenants of multifamily and seniors housing properties, which may decrease rent collections. The U.S. government has or may institute various relief measures intended to provide economic assistance to businesses and individuals, but it is uncertain if such relief measures will be sufficient for the tenants of multifamily and seniors housing properties to avoid defaulting on their rent obligations, which would result in lower rent collections by project owners. In addition, many state and local governments have or may issue regulations preventing the eviction of tenants for a period of time, which limits the ability of multifamily and seniors housing properties to replace non-paying tenants, which may further negatively impact rent collections. In addition, shelter-in-place and social distancing measures imposed as a result of a highly infectious or contagious disease, will create challenges for the leasing of units and stabilization of projects that have completed construction. Lower rent collections and occupancy will negatively impact the ability of properties securing our MRBs, GILs, and property loans to meet debt service obligations. Lower rent collections and occupancy will also negatively impact the operating results of our MF Properties and the distributions and returns from our JV Equity Investments. 
 A highly infectious or contagious disease may cause significant volatility in the financial markets and the operating performance of properties related to our investment assets, which may negatively impair the value of our investments and cause us to recognize impairments. Such impairments may also require us to post additional collateral for our trust securitization financing arrangements, inhibit our ability to renew or obtain leverage for our investments, and lower the potential proceeds received on the sale of our investments. In addition, financial market volatility may prevent us from issuing additional BUCs or Preferred Units, which would negatively impact our access to additional capital and liquidity. 
 26 

A highly infectious or contagious disease may disrupt the supply chain for materials and labor required for the construction of multifamily and seniors housing properties securing our MRBs, GILs, and property loans and multifamily properties that underlie our JV Equity Investments, causing delays in construction leading to additional costs to complete construction. 
 A highly infectious or contagious disease may necessitate employees of Greystone that manage our operations to work remotely or, if such employees are infected, may limit their ability to perform essential tasks. Though we maintain policies and contingencies if such employees are unavailable, there may be temporary disruptions to our day-to-day operations. In addition, a highly infectious or contagious disease may also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us. 
 Risks Related to Debt Financings and Derivative Instruments 
 Our investment strategy involves significant leverage, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may increase our investment risk exposure by funding a portion of new or existing investment assets with debt financing or other borrowing arrangements. To the extent that income derived from such leveraged assets exceeds our interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds and had not invested in such assets on a leveraged basis. Conversely, if the revenue from our investment does not sufficiently cover the interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be less or our net loss will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds. Because of the credit and interest rate risks inherent in our investment strategies, we closely monitor the leverage of our investment portfolio. From time to time, our leverage ratio may increase or decrease due to several factors, including changes in the value of the underlying portfolio, changes in investment allocations and the timing and amount of acquisitions. 
 Our access to financing sources, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, may be limited, and our lenders and derivative counterparties may require us to post additional collateral. These circumstances may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to pay distributions to our Unitholders. 
 Our ability to fund our operations, meet financial obligations, and finance targeted investment opportunities may be impacted by an inability to secure and maintain debt financing from current or potential future lenders. Our lenders are primarily large global financial institutions or regional commercial banks, with exposures both to global financial markets and to more localized economic conditions. Whether because of a global or local financial crisis or other circumstances, such as if one or more of our lenders experiences severe financial difficulties, they or other lenders could become unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, could increase our retained interests required for such financing, or could increase the costs of that financing. 
 In addition, if there is a contraction in the overall availability of debt financing for our investment assets, including if the regulatory capital requirements imposed on our lenders change, our lenders may significantly increase the cost of the financing that they provide to us, or increase the amounts of collateral they require as a condition to providing us with financing. Our lenders may revise their eligibility requirements for the types of investment assets that they are willing to finance or the terms of such financing arrangements, including increases in our retained interest requirements, based on, among other factors, the regulatory environment and their management of actual and perceived risk. 
 Moreover, the amount of financing that we receive under our financing agreements will be directly related to our lenders valuation of the financed assets subject to such agreements. If a lender s valuations for individual asset classes are lower than expected, the advance rate from the lender will be lower resulting in a net increase in our retained interests in the overall transaction and cause a decrease in our leveraged returns. Consequently, depending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely on additional equity issuances to meet our capital and financing needs, which may be dilutive to our Unitholders, or we may have to rely on less efficient forms of debt financing at higher costs thereby reducing our operating cash flows, net income and CAD, and reducing our funds available to make additional investments. 
 There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our investment assets. 
 We obtain debt financing through various securitization programs related to our investment assets. The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our investment assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors while we retain a residual interest. The trust administrator receives all the principal and interest payments from the underlying assets and distributes proceeds to holders of the various security interests. The senior securities are paid contractual principal and interest at a variable or fixed rate, depending on the terms of the security. As the holder of the residual interest, we are entitled to any remaining principal and interest after payment of all trust-related fees (i.e. trustee fees, remarketing agent fees, liquidity provider fees, credit enhancement fees, etc.). Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following: 
 27 

Changes in interest rates can adversely affect the cost of the asset securitization financing. 
 The interest rates payable on certain senior securities are variable. The senior securities associated with our M33 TEBS and TOB trust securitizations have variable interest rates that reset on a weekly basis. The interest rates are determined by the respective remarketing agents based on the rate third party purchasers are willing to receive to purchase the senior securities at par. Changes in such rates are generally, though not always, consistent with movements in market interest rate indices. In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may be required in order to successfully remarket these securities. Any increase in the interest rate payable on the senior securities will cause an increase in our interest expense and decrease the amount of residual cash flows available to us. Higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the return on our residual interests. 
 Payments on our residual interests are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of all trust-related fees. 
 Our residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities and payment of all trust-related fees. As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to us as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities and trust expenses have been paid in full. As the holder of residual interests in these trusts, we can look only to the cash flow of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual interests. No third party guarantees the payment of any return to be received for our residual interests. 
 Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for many reasons which could result in the liquidation of the securitized assets and result in additional losses. 
 In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for many different reasons relating to issues with the assets or issues with the trust itself. Potential termination triggers related to the securitized assets include non-payment of debt service or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable. Potential termination triggers related to a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the trust credit enhancer, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain credit or liquidity support for the trust. In each of these cases, the trust will be terminated and the securitized assets held by the trusts will be sold. If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities plus accrued interest and all trust-related expenses then, we will be required, through our guaranty of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall. We may lose our investment in the residual interest and, except for our TEBS financings, realize additional losses to fully repay the senior trust obligations. 
 An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair our ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged in connection with a bond securitization financing. 
 In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership. In that situation, it is possible that we would not be able to recover the investment assets or other collateral pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that we will not receive all payments due on our residual interests. 
 We may be required to post additional collateral if the securitized investment assets and related derivative instruments experience declines in value. 
 We may be required to post collateral, typically in cash, related to the TOB trusts and derivative instruments with Mizuho and Barclays as our counterparties. The amount of collateral posting required is dependent on the valuation of the investment assets and related derivative instruments in relation to thresholds set by the lenders on each business day. 
 Our net exposure, as calculated by Mizuho, was in favor of the Partnership in an amount of approximately 935,000 as of December 31, 2022. If the value of the Partnership s positions with Mizuho experience a net decrease of over 935,000 then we will be required to post cash collateral for the net negative exposure. Our positions with Mizuho subject to daily valuation adjustment consist of 234.4 million of fixed rate MRBs, 46.1 million variable rate MRBs and taxable MRBs, 242.1 million of variable rate GILs and taxable GILs, 122.8 million of variable rate property loans, 194.7 million notional balance of interest rate swaps, and 102.7 million notional balance of our total return swap. Potential changes in the value of our variable rate assets are primarily driven by market credit spreads, not changes in the absolute level of market interest rates, such that valuations are typically at or near par. Furthermore, the total return swap valuation does not typically change with market interest rates. Our fixed rate MRBs and fixed payor interest rate swaps are most sensitive to changing market interest rates, however, we have structured the portfolio such that decreases in investment asset values will generally be offset by increases in the value of our 
 28 

interest rate swaps and vice versa. However, such relationships may diverge in the near term, which may result in us being required to post collateral with Mizuho. 
 Our net exposure, as calculated by Barclays, was in favor of the Partnership in an amount of approximately 690,000 as of December 31, 2022. If the value of the Partnership s positions with Barclays experience a net decrease of over 690,000 then we will be required to post cash collateral for the net negative exposure. Our positions subject to daily valuation adjustment consist of 10.4 million of fixed rate MRBs, 23.9 million of fixed rate GILs and taxable GILs, 40.2 million of variable rate GILs, and 4.7 million of variable rate property loans. Potential changes in the value of our variable rate assets are primarily driven by market credit spreads, not changes in the absolute level of market interest rates, such that valuations are typically at or near par. 
 There is risk that we will not meet financial covenants, non-financial covenants and risk retention requirements. 
 We are subject to various financial and non-financial covenants according to our ISDA master agreements with Mizuho and Barclays. Such covenants included, but are not limited to, maintaining minimum partners capital balances, certain limits on declines in net assets over specified time periods, certain limitations on leverage, and requiring that the BUCs remain listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, termination of the trust securitizations, acceleration of all amounts owed, and generally would give the counterparty the right to exercise certain other remedies under the ISDA master agreements. Further, certain of our ISDA master agreements have cross-default, cross-acceleration or similar provisions, such that if we were to violate a covenant under one trust securitization, that violation could lead to defaults, accelerations, or other adverse events under other trust securitizations and lines of credit as well. 
 Certain regulations related to our TOB trust securitizations require that we maintain a minimum economic interest in the residual and/or senior securities issued by the trust. Declines in the value of the securitized assets below certain levels will require us to purchase senior securities to satisfy our minimum risk retention requirements, which will negatively impact our liquidity and leveraged returns. 
 We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements. 
 We purchase derivative instruments to either (i) mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates, or (ii) reduce the net interest cost related to our Secured Notes. There is no assurance these instruments will fully insulate us from any adverse financial consequences resulting from rising interest rates. In addition, our risks from derivative instruments include the following: 
 The costs to purchase our derivative instruments may not be recovered over the contractual term. 

The counterparty may be unable to perform its obligations to us under the instrument. 

If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a derivative position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to us. 

There may be a lack of available counterparties with acceptable credit profiles that are willing to originate derivative instruments for interest rate indices that match our variable interest rate exposure, such as the SIFMA index. In such instances, we may enter into derivative instruments related to different interest rate indices, such as SOFR, that we believe correlate closely with our variable interest rate exposure. However, we cannot be certain that such close correlation will be realized. 

Changes in interest rates can adversely affect the net interest cost of the total return swaps and related Secured Notes. 

We are required to post collateral associated with a decline in the fair value of the Secured Notes below the outstanding principal amount. 

Upon termination of the total return swap, we will be required to cash settle any deficit associated with the fair value of the Secured Notes compared to the outstanding principal amount. 

We report our derivative instruments at fair value on our financial statements with changes recorded in current earnings. This can result in significant period to period volatility in our reported net income over the term of these instruments. 
 We are subject to various risks associated with our secured line of credit arrangements. 
 We have two secured line of credit facilities that we utilize as temporary financing for our investment acquisitions and for general working capital needs. Balances on our secured line of credit facilities are secured by certain investment assets pledged as collateral. 
 29 

We are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, which if not maintained, will cause a default and acceleration of amounts due, negatively impacting our liquidity. Furthermore, declines in collateral values may trigger requirements that we repay balances or a portion of balances early or limit the amount that can be drawn under a borrowing base calculation for one of the facilities. One of our secured line of credit facilities has a deficiency guaranty provided by an affiliate, Greystone Select Incorporated Greystone Select ), and is subject to various financial and non-financial covenants. A covenant default by Greystone Select will trigger a default on our obligations under the line of credit facility and accelerate amounts owed to the lenders. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Beneficial Unit Certificates and Preferred Units 
 Cash distributions related to BUCs may change at the discretion of the Partnership s general partner. 
 The amount of the cash per BUC distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the sole determination of the Partnership s general partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for this purpose, as well as other factors it deems to be relevant. We may supplement our cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per BUC from current levels. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of annual cash distributions per BUC even if we complete our current investment plans. Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our BUCs. 
 Inflation may cause the real value of distributions on our BUCs and Preferred Units to decline. 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value or purchasing power of money. Recently, inflation has increased to its highest level in decades. As inflation increases, the real value of our BUCs and Preferred Unit distributions therefore will decline. 
 Any future issuances of additional BUCs could cause their market value to decline. 
 We may issue additional BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital. The issuance of additional BUCs will cause dilution of the existing BUCs and may cause a decrease in the market price of the BUCs. 
 Certain rights of our BUC holders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units and, if issued, Series B Preferred Units, and these rights may have a negative effect on the value of the BUCs. 
 The holders of our Preferred Units, and any other class or series of Partnership interests or securities, including debt securities, we may issue in the future that are expressly designated as ranking senior to the BUCs, have rights with respect to anticipated quarterly distributions and rights upon liquidation, dissolution, or the winding-up of the Partnership s affairs which are senior to those of the holders of BUCs. In addition, upon a liquidation, lenders with respect to our borrowings and potential debt securities will be entitled to receive our available assets prior to any distributions to the holders of our Preferred Units and BUCs. The holders of our Preferred Units also have the right to have their units redeemed by the Partnership under certain circumstances. The existence of these senior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of the BUCs. 
 Holders of Preferred Units have extremely limited voting rights. 
 The voting rights of a holder of Preferred Units are extremely limited. Our BUCs are the only class of our partnership interests carrying full voting rights. 
 The Partnership s general partner has the authority to declare cash distributions related to the Preferred Units. 
 The holders of Preferred Units are entitled to receive non-cumulative cash distributions, when, as, and if declared by the Partnership s general partner, out of funds legally available therefor, at stated annual rates. Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership s General Partner has the authority, based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for distributions, not to declare distributions to the holders of the Preferred Units. 
 Holders of Preferred Units may have liability to repay distributions. 
 Under certain circumstances, holders of the Series A Preferred Units may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause the Partnership s liabilities to exceed the fair value of its assets. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the Partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. 
 30 

Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. A purchaser of Preferred Units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the Partnership that are known to such purchaser of Preferred Units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from our Partnership Agreement. 
 We may be required to redeem Preferred Units in the future. 
 Under the terms of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred Units, upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale to an investor, and upon each anniversary thereafter, each holder of such Preferred Units will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Partnership to redeem, in whole or in part, the units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to 10.00 per unit plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Units, upon the eighth anniversary of the closing of the sale to an investor, and upon each anniversary thereafter, each holder of such Preferred Units will have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Partnership to redeem, in whole or in part, the units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to 10.00 per unit plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption. Holders of the Preferred Units must provide written notice to the General Partner of their intent to redeem at least 180 days prior to the redemption date. In addition, if the General Partner determines that the ratio of the aggregate market value of issued and outstanding BUCs to the aggregate value of issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units has fallen below 1.0 and has remained below 1.0 for a period of 15 consecutive business days, then each holder of Series A, Series A-1 and Series B Preferred Units will have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, the Preferred Units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to 10.00 per unit plus all declared and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption. If such redemptions occur, we will be required to fund redemption proceeds using, including, but not limited to, our general secured line of credit, cash on hand, alternative financing, or the sale of assets. Such actions may limit our ability to make additional investments with accretive returns and may negatively impact our results of operations through higher costs or lower investment returns. If we do not have sufficient funds available to fulfill these obligations, we may be unable to satisfy an investor s redemption right. 
 Certain holders of our Series A Preferred Units are nearing the sixth anniversary of the original issuance of their units and, therefore, will have the ability to redeem their units. We have received no redemption notices from holders as of December 31, 2022. However, in February 2023, we received notice from a holder of 2,000,000 Series A Preferred Units of its intent to redeem all its Series A Preferred Units. We anticipate paying redemption proceeds of 20.0 million in August 2023. 
 The assets held by the Partnership may not be considered qualified investments under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA by the bank regulatory authorities. 
 In most cases, qualified investments are required to be responsive to the community development needs of a financial institution s delineated CRA assessment area or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the institution s assessment area. For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to the Partnership s Preferred Units, the Partnership must hold CRA qualifying investments that relate to the institution s CRA assessment area. 
 As defined in the CRA, qualified investments are any lawful investments, deposits, membership shares, or grants that have as their primary purpose community development. The term community development is defined in the CRA as: (1) affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) community services targeted to low- or moderate-income individuals; (3) activities that promote economic development by financing businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of 13 C.F.R. 121.802(a)(2) and (3) or have gross annual revenues of 1 million or less; or (4) activities that revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income geographies, designated disaster areas, or distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income geographies designated by the federal banking regulators. 
 In June 2020, the OCC adopted amendments to its CRA regulations that resulted in the financial institutions for which it is the primary federal regulator (i.e., national banks and federal savings associations) to be subject to different CRA standards than those that apply to the state-chartered banks for which either the FDIC or FRB is the primary federal regulator. The OCC s 2020 regulations, among other things, replaced the term qualified investments with community development investments, which the regulation defined to include lawful investments or legally binding commitments to invest that are reported on the Call Report, Schedule RC L that meet the expanded community development qualifying activities criteria in the rule. 
 Parts of this June 2020 amendment to the OCC s CRA regulations became effective on October 1, 2020, but the more material provisions would not have taken effect until January 1, 2023 or January 1, 2024. On September 8, 2021, the OCC issued a proposal to rescind its June 2020 final rule and replace it with a rule largely based on its CRA regulations that existed prior to the adoption of its June 2020 amendments. The OCC stated in the preamble to this proposal that it intended to align its CRA rules with the FRB s and FDIC s CRA rules, and thereby reinstitute the regulatory uniformity for all insured depository institutions that existed prior to the OCC s adoption of its June 2020 rule. On December 14, 2021, the OCC adopted a final rule implementing these changes to its CRA regulations, which became effective on January 1, 2022. 
 31 

Investments are not typically designated as qualifying investments by the OCC, FRB or FDIC at the time of issuance. Accordingly, the General Partner must evaluate whether each potential investment may be a qualifying investment with respect to a specific Unitholder. The final determinations that Partnership units are qualifying investments are made by the OCC, FRB or FDIC and, where applicable, state bank supervisory agencies during their periodic examinations of financial institutions. There is no assurance that the agencies will concur with the General Partner s determinations. 
 Each holder of the Partnership s Preferred Units is a limited partner of the Partnership, not just of the investments in its Designated Target Region(s). The financial returns on an investor s investment will be determined based on the performance of all the assets in the Partnership s geographically diverse portfolio, not just by the performance of the assets in the Designated Target Region(s) selected by the investor. 
 In determining whether a particular investment is qualified, the General Partner will assess whether the investment has as its primary purpose community development. The General Partner will consider whether the investment: (1) provides affordable housing for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) provides community services targeted to low- to moderate-income individuals; (3) funds activities that (a) finance businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of the Small Business Administration s Development Company or Small Business Investment Company programs or have annual revenues of 1 million or less and (b) promote economic development; or (4) funds activities that revitalize or stabilize low- to moderate-income areas. The General Partner may also consider whether an investment revitalizes or stabilizes a designated disaster area or an area designated by those agencies as a distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income area. 
 An activity may be deemed to promote economic development if it supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement for persons who are currently low- to moderate-income, or supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement in low- to moderate-income areas targeted for redevelopment by federal, state, local, or tribal governments. Activities that revitalize or stabilize a low- to moderate-income geography are activities that help attract and retain businesses and residents. The General Partner maintains documentation, readily available to a financial institution or an examiner, supporting its determination that a Partnership asset is a qualifying investment for CRA purposes. 
 An investment in the Preferred Units is not a deposit or obligation of, or insured or guaranteed by, any entity or person, including the U.S. Government and the FDIC. The value of the Partnership s assets will vary, reflecting changes in market conditions, interest rates, and other political and economic factors. There is no assurance that the Partnership can achieve its investment objective, since all investments are inherently subject to market risk. There also can be no assurance that either the Partnership s investments or Preferred Units of the Partnership will receive investment test credit under the CRA. 
 Under certain circumstances, investors may not receive CRA credit for their investment in the Preferred Units. 
 The CRA requires the three federal bank supervisory agencies, the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC, to encourage the institutions they regulate to help meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Each agency has promulgated rules for evaluating and rating an institution s CRA performance which, as the following summary indicates, vary according to an institution s asset size. An institution s CRA performance can also be adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory credit practices regardless of its asset size. 
 For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to an investment in the Preferred Units, the Partnership must hold CRA qualifying investments that relate to the institution s delineated CRA assessment area. The Partnership expects that an investment in its Preferred Units will be considered a qualified investment under the CRA, but neither the Partnership nor the General Partner has received an interpretative letter from the FFIEC stating that an investment in the Partnership is considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA. Moreover, there is no guarantee that future changes to the CRA or future interpretations by the FFIEC will not affect the continuing eligibility of the Partnership s investments. So that an investment in the Partnership may be considered a qualified investment, the Partnership will seek to invest only in investments that meet the prevailing community investing standards put forth by U.S. regulatory agencies. 
 In this regard, the Partnership expects that a majority of its investments will be considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA, but there is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for its investment in the Preferred Units. For example, a state banking regulator may not consider the Partnership eligible for regulatory credit. If CRA credit is not given, there is a risk that an investor may not fulfill its CRA requirements. 
 The Partnership s portfolio investment decisions may create CRA strategy risks. 
 Portfolio investment decisions take into account the Partnership s goal of holding MRBs and other securities in designated geographic areas and will not be exclusively based on the investment characteristics of such assets, which may or may not have an adverse effect on the Partnership s investment performance. CRA qualified assets in geographic areas sought by the Partnership may not provide as favorable return as CRA qualified assets in other geographic areas. The Partnership may sell assets for reasons relating 
 32 

to CRA qualification at times when such sales may not be desirable and may hold short-term investments that produce relatively low yields pending the selection of long-term investments believed to be CRA-qualified. 
 The Preferred Units are subordinated to existing and future debt obligations, and the interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional units, including additional Preferred Units, and by other transactions. 
 The Preferred Units are subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, including indebtedness outstanding under any senior bank credit facility. The Partnership may incur additional debt under its senior bank credit facility or future credit facilities, including debt securities. The payment of principal and interest on its debt reduces cash available for distribution to Unitholders, including the Preferred Units. 
 The Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units are pari passu and senior to the Series B Preferred Units. The issuance of additional units pari passu with or senior to the existing series of Preferred Units would dilute the interests of the holders of the Preferred Units, and any issuance of senior securities, parity securities, or additional indebtedness could affect the Partnership s ability to pay distributions on or redeem the Preferred Units. 
 Holders of the Preferred Units may be required to bear the risks of an investment for an indefinite period of time. 
 Holders of the Preferred Units may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Preferred Units for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the Preferred Units will rank junior to all Partnership current and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under the Partnership s senior bank credit facility) and other liabilities, and any other senior securities we may issue in the future with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against the Partnership. 
 Treatment of distributions on our Preferred Units is uncertain. 
 The tax treatment of distributions on our Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat the holders of Preferred Units as partners for tax purposes and will treat distributions paid to holders of Preferred Units as being made to such holders in their capacity as partners. If the Preferred Units are not partnership interests, they likely would constitute indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes and distributions to the holders of Preferred Units would constitute ordinary interest income to holders of Preferred Units. If Preferred Units are treated as partnership interests, but distributions to holders of Preferred Units are not treated as being made to such holders in their capacity as partners, then these distributions likely would be treated as guaranteed payments for the use of capital. Guaranteed payments generally would be taxable to the recipient as ordinary income, and a recipient could recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment even in the absence of a contemporaneous distribution. Potential investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences of owning our Preferred Units. 
 There is no public market for the Preferred Units, which may prevent an investor from liquidating its investment. 
 The Preferred Units may not be resold unless the Partnership registers the securities with the SEC or an exemption from the registration requirement is available. It is not expected that any market for the Preferred Units will develop or be sustained in the future. The lack of any public market for the Preferred Units severely limits the ability to liquidate the investment, except for the right to put the Preferred Units to the Partnership under certain circumstances. 
 Market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Preferred Units. 
 One of the factors that will influence the value of the Preferred Units will be the distribution rate on the Preferred Units (as a percentage of the price of the units) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which continue to remain at low levels relative to historical rates, may lower the value of the Preferred Units and also would likely increase the Partnership s borrowing costs. 
 Risks Related to Income Taxes 
 Income from various investments is subject to taxation. 
 Income from our property loans, taxable MRBs, taxable GILs, MF Properties, and JV Equity Investments and related gains or losses on sale are subject to federal and potentially state income taxes. Furthermore, income and gains generated by assets within our wholly owned subsidiary (the Greens Hold Co and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes as the Greens Hold Co is a C corporation for income tax purposes. 
 To the extent we generate taxable income, Unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions. 
 33 

As a partnership, our Unitholders are individually liable for income taxes on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by us, whether or not we make cash distributions. 
 There are limits on the ability of our Unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them. 
 The ability of Unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by us will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for Unitholders who are individuals. 
 Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our MRBs or GILs is determined to be taxable. 
 In each MRB and GIL transaction, the governmental issuer, as well as the underlying borrower, has covenanted and agreed to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements necessary to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest earned on the MRBs and GILs. Failure to comply with such requirements may cause interest on the related investment to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs. Should the interest income on an MRB or GIL be deemed to be taxable, the governing documents include a variety of rights and remedies that we have concluded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected MRBs or GILs. Under such circumstances, we would enforce all such rights and remedies as set forth in the related governing documents as well as any other rights and remedies available under applicable law. In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any MRB or GIL is challenged by the IRS, we would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and would, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations. The loss of tax-exemption for any individual MRB or GIL would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated MRBs or GILs. However, the loss of such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our Unitholders of taxable income relating to such MRBs and GILs. 
 In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place MRBs and GILs into trusts and are entitled to a share of the interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interest on senior securities and related expenses issued by the trust. It is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes. 
 If we are determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for us and our Unitholders. 
 We have determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for us and allow us to pass through our interest income on our MRBs and GILs, which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt, to our Unitholders so that they are not subject to federal income tax on this income. If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is successfully challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation. This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by us to Unitholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of our earnings and profits. The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by us. The listing of our BUCs for trading on the NYSE causes us to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the IRC. A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90 or more of its gross income is qualifying income. Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held to produce interest or dividends, and certain other items. While we believe that all interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all our income could be determined not to be qualifying income. In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, we will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes. 
 Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Matters 
 We are not registered under the Investment Company Act. 
 We are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act because we operate under an exemption therefrom. As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) are applicable to us. 
 Any downgrade, or anticipated downgrade, of U.S. sovereign credit ratings or the credit ratings of the U.S. Government-sponsored entities GSEs by the various credit rating agencies may materially adversely affect our business. 
 Our TEBS financing facilities are an integral part of our business strategy and those financings are dependent upon an investment grade rating of Freddie Mac. If Freddie Mac were to be downgraded to below investment grade, it would have a negative effect on our 
 34 

ability to finance our MRB portfolio on a longer-term basis and could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our ability to continue distributions to our Unitholders at current levels. 
 The federal conservatorship of Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business. 
 The problems faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commencing in 2008 resulting in them being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant U.S. Government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S. Government in providing liquidity and credit enhancement for mortgage loans, including single family and multifamily mortgages. As a result, the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be reduced (perhaps significantly) and the nature of their guaranty obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements. Alternatively, it is still possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be dissolved entirely or privatized, and, as mentioned above, the U.S. Government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market. Any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guaranty obligations could have broad adverse implications for the housing market and our business, operations, and financial condition. If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to be eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guaranty obligation, reduction in the size and scope of activities, etc.), our ability to utilize TEBS financings facilities would be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, if Freddie Mac is no longer willing to provide forward purchase commitments related to our future GIL investment opportunities, it may impact our ability to obtain leverage on such investment opportunities such that they may not be accretive to operating results. 
 The Partnership faces legislative and regulatory risks in connection with its assets and operations, including under the CRA. 
 Many aspects of the Partnership s investment objectives are directly affected by the national and local legal and regulatory environments. Changes in laws, regulations, or the interpretation of regulations could all pose risks to the successful realization of the Partnership s investment objectives. 
 It is not known what changes, if any, may be made to the CRA in the future and what impact these changes could have on regulators or the various states that have their own versions of the CRA. Changes in the CRA might affect our operations and might pose a risk to the successful realization of our investment objectives. Repeal of the CRA would significantly reduce the attractiveness of an investment in our Preferred Units for regulated investors. There is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for its investment in the Preferred Units. 
 The replacement of the London Interbank Bank Offering Rate LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that certain LIBOR tenors either would cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021 in the case of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar tenors, and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023 in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar tenors. Further, on March 15, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, was signed into law by the President of the United States. This legislation enables a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts that mature after June 30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable reference rate fallback provisions. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to use a replacement rate recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which is a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR, an index calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to the use of SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from LIBOR benchmarks proceeds, and it remains uncertain how closely correlated such alternative reference rates may be to LIBOR in the near and long term. Our investment assets with interest rates indexed to LIBOR consisted of one MRB, one taxable MRB and three property loans as of December 31, 2022. The Partnership generally controls the determination of alternative reference rates for such investment assets. Regarding our liabilities, our general secured line of credit also has interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2022 and the secured credit agreement contains terms for selecting an alternative index if LIBOR is no longer available. 
 While we expect most tenors of LIBOR will be available during the first half of 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to June 30, 2023. This could occur, for example, if a sufficient number of banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate would be accelerated or magnified. As such, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we will need to amend our agreements referencing LIBOR rates based on the terms of each agreement or protocols issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA ). 
 The phasing out of LIBOR could impact short-term interest rates in general which could potentially increase the cost of our debt financing arrangements. The transition to an alternative rate is complex and will require careful and deliberate consideration and implementation so as not to disrupt the stability of financial markets. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative 
 35 

index will not result in, among other things, financial market disruptions. Moreover, the transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of any changes in the pricing of our investments, changes in the documentation for certain of our investments and debt financing arrangements and the pace of such changes, disputes and other actions regarding the interpretation of current and prospective loan documentation, or modifications to processes and systems. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We face possible risks associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather. 
 The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our investments and operating results. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. These conditions may negatively impact the pace and cost of properties under construction. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand and operating results for properties related to our investment assets. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost and/or availability of property insurance and increased repair and maintenance costs. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our investments and operating results. 
 We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber-attacks, security issues, and expanding social media vehicles present new risks. 
 We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Certain critical components of our information systems are hosted and supported by third-party service providers and affiliates of Greystone. If we and our service providers do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We could also experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, we may be negatively impacted by business interruption, litigation, and reputational damages from leakage of confidential information or from systems conversions when, and if, they occur in the normal course of business. 
 Our third-party service providers and Greystone affiliates are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and, in certain instances, we rely significantly on third-party service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner. All such third-party vendors face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us. While we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases, we do not directly control any of such parties information technology security operations, or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats. Accordingly, we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us. 
 Although no material incidents have occurred to date, we cannot be certain that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident should one occur. 
 The inappropriate use of certain media could cause brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about the Partnership on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information through external media channels could have a negative impact to the Partnership. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges. Any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our BUCs.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 General 
 In this Management s Discussion and Analysis, all references to we, us, and the Partnership refer to Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP, its consolidated subsidiaries, and consolidated VIEs for all periods presented. See Note 2 and Note 5 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for further disclosure. 
 On April 1, 2022, the Partnership effected a one-for-three reverse unit split of its outstanding BUCs (the Reverse Unit Split ). On October 31, 2022, the Partnership completed a distribution in the form of additional BUCs at a ratio of 0.01044 BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of September 30, 2022 (the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution ). On January 31, 2023, the Partnership completed a distribution in the form of additional BUCs at a ratio of 0.0105 BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of December 30, 2022 (the Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution , collectively with the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution, the BUCs Distributions ). The amounts indicated in this Item 7 have been adjusted to reflect both the Reverse Unit Split and the BUCs Distributions on a retroactive basis. 
 Executive Summary 
 The Partnership was formed in 1998 for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds MRBs that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily housing, seniors housing and commercial properties. We also invest in governmental issuer loans GILs ), which are similar to MRBs, to provide construction financing for affordable multifamily housing properties. We expect and believe the interest received on these MRBs and GILs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate and may make property loans to multifamily properties which may or may not be financed by MRBs or GILs held by us and may or may not be secured by real estate. 
 We also make noncontrolling equity investments in unconsolidated entities for the construction, stabilization, and ultimate sale of market-rate multifamily properties. We are entitled to distributions if, and when, cash is available for distribution either through operations, a refinance or sale of the property. In addition, the Partnership may acquire and hold interests in multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties MF Properties until their highest and best use can be determined by management. 
 As of December 31,2022, we had four reportable segments: (1) Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments, (2) Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments, (3) Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments and (4) MF Properties. We separately report our consolidation and elimination information because we do not allocate certain items to the segments. All General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations are reported within the Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments segment. See Notes 2 and 24 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details. The following table presents summary information regarding activity of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Corporate Responsibility 
 We are committed to corporate responsibility and the importance of developing environmental, social and governance ESG policies and practices consistent with that commitment. We believe the implementation and maintenance of such policies and practices benefit the employees that serve the Partnership, support long-term performance for our Unitholders, and have a positive impact on society and the environment. 
 40 

Environmental Responsibility 
 Achieving environmental and sustainability goals in connection with our affordable housing investment activity is important to us. Opportunities for positive environmental investments are open to us because private activity bond volume cap and LIHTC allocations are key components of the capital structure for most new construction or acquisition/rehabilitation affordable housing properties financed by our MRB and GIL investments. These resources are allocated by individual states to our property sponsors through a competitive application process under a state-specific qualified allocation plan QAP as required under Section 42 of the IRC. Each state implements its public policy objectives through an application scoring or ranking system that rewards certain property features. Some of the common features rewarded under individual state QAPs are transit amenities (proximity to various forms of public transportation), proximity to public services (parks, libraries, full scale supermarkets, or a senior center), and energy efficiency/sustainability. Some state-specific QAPs have minimum energy efficiency standards that must be met, such as use of low water need landscaping, Energy Star appliances and hot water heaters, and GREENGUARD Gold certified insulation. Since we can only finance properties with successful applications, we work with our sponsor clients to maximize these environmental features such that their applications can earn the most points possible under the individual state s QAP. During 2022, we closed the following MRB and GIL investments related to properties that were awarded both private activity bond cap and LIHTC allocations through state-specific QAPs:

In 2021, we acquired an MRB investment secured by Meadow Valley, a to-be-constructed 154-unit seniors housing facility in Traverse City, MI. Part of the construction financing is provided through a Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program, which is a state policy-enabled financing mechanism that allows developers to access the capital needed to make renewable energy accessible and cost-effective. In the case of Meadow Valley, C-PACE financing of 24.8 million will be provided to finance energy conservation features including high efficiency windows, roof, walls, heating, cooling, indoor and outdoor lighting, water heating and low-flow fixtures. The C-PACE financing is repaid through a property tax assessment over the life of the property. Many lenders are averse to financing properties with C-PACE financing as the tax assessment is a senior obligation of the property. We have developed underwriting procedures that allow for the borrower to obtain C-PACE financing and still meet our security and underwriting requirements. We will continue to evaluate investment opportunities related to properties that utilize C-PACE financing for future investment as we want to encourage our borrowers to utilize clean energy design and construction practices. 
 The Suites on Paseo MF Property, which is wholly owned by the Partnership, is a LEED Silver Certified property. LEED provides a framework for healthy, efficient, carbon and cost-saving green buildings. To achieve LEED certification, a property earns points by adhering to prerequisites and credits that address carbon, energy, water, waste, transportation, materials, health and indoor environmental quality. In addition, the property has three rooftop solar panels arrays to generate renewable energy for the local power system. Two of the arrays are owned by the local utility provider on roof space leased by the property and the third array is owned by the property. 
 We are committed to minimizing the overall environmental impact of our corporate operations. The Partnership s operations are primarily managed by 14 employees of Greystone Manager, so we have a relatively modest environmental impact and have adequate facilities to grow our employee base without acquiring additional physical space. 
 Social Responsibility 
 Our MRB and GIL investments directly support the construction, rehabilitation, and stabilized operation of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable multifamily housing across the United States. The development of affordable multifamily housing has relatively broad legislative support at the federal and state levels. Each of the properties securing our MRB and GIL investments is required to maintain a minimum percentage of units set-aside for a combination of extremely low-income (30 of area median income or AMI ), very low-income (50 of AMI), and low-income (80 of AMI) tenants in accordance with IRC guidelines, and the owners of the properties often agree to exceed the minimum IRC requirements. The rent charged to income qualified tenants at MRB or GIL properties is often restricted to a certain percentage of the tenants income, making them more affordable. For any newly originated MRBs or GILs associated with a low-income housing tax credit property, restrictions regarding tenant incomes and rents charged to those low-income households are required. In addition, certain borrowers related to our MRB investments are non-profit entities that provide affordable multifamily housing consistent with their charitable purposes. These properties provide valuable housing and support services to both low-income and market-rate tenants and create housing diversity in the geographic and social communities in which they are located. 
 The following table summarizes, by investment asset class, the number of residential rental units associated with the affordable multifamily properties financed by the Partnership that have some form of tenant income or rent restrictions as evidenced by a regulatory agreement recorded on the local government land records as of December 31, 2022:

Certain investments may be eligible for regulatory credit under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they exist, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods. See Community Investments in this Item 7 below for further information regarding assets of the Partnership the General Partner believes are eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA. 
 We and Greystone are committed to supporting our workforce. Greystone has implemented evaluation and compensation policies designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees that provide services to the Partnership to achieve superior results. Greystone also provides formal and informal training programs to enhance the skills of employees providing services to the Partnership and to instill Greystone s corporate policies and practices. We are also committed to ensuring the safety of personnel that work for third-party contractors that perform services at properties that underlie our investment assets. Specifically for properties under construction, we consider the safety record of contractors and monitor safety incidents through reviews of independent construction monitoring reports. 
 42 

Greystone and the Partnership are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion DEI ). Specific Greystone DEI initiatives include formal diversity training and employee resources groups to support a diverse workforce as well as a formal DEI committee and DEI Leadership Council to lead and advise all DEI related work, events, and learning. Of the 14 employees of Greystone Manager responsible for the Partnership s operations, three are women and one employee identifies as ethnically diverse. 
 Corporate Governance 
 Greystone Manager, as the general partner of the Partnership s general partner, is committed to corporate governance that aligns with the interests of our Unitholders and stakeholders. We set high ethical standards for our related employees and partners. We regularly review and update, as appropriate, our policies governing ethical conduct and responsible behavior in order to support our sustainable and continued success. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is applicable to all Greystone personnel that provide services to the Partnership and is available on the Partnership s website. All employees are required to annually affirm that they have read and understood the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Employees are encouraged to share any ethics or compliance concerns with their supervisors or confidentially through our third-party managed hotline. We maintain a formal compliance policy to investigate ethics or compliance concerns and to protect whistleblowers. Our policy is designed to meet the requirements and standards of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2022 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The Board of Managers of Greystone Manager brings a diverse set of skills and experiences across industries in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. The composition of the Greystone Manager Board of Managers is in compliance with the NYSE listing rules and SEC rules applicable to the Partnership. All the members of the Audit Committee of Greystone Manager are independent under the applicable SEC and NYSE independence requirements, two of whom qualify as audit committee financial experts. Of the six Managers of Greystone Manager, one Manager is female. 
 The Greystone Manager Board of Managers is highly engaged in the governance and operations of the Partnership. Our non-independent Managers are employees of Greystone that regularly monitor developments in our operating environment and capital markets and discuss such developments with management on a regular basis. One of our Managers is a member of our investment committee that pre-approves all new investments. We regularly monitor and assess risks to achieving our business objectives and such risk assessments are discussed with both the Audit Committee and the full Board of Managers at regularly held meetings and in regular informal discussions. The following table summarizes the number of meetings and attendance during 2022:

Affordable Multifamily MRB Investments Segment 
 The Partnership s primary purpose is to acquire and hold as investments a portfolio of MRBs which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for residential properties and commercial properties in their market area. We have also invested in taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans which are included within this segment. All General and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations are reported within this segment. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 76 MRBs with aggregate outstanding principal of 766.3 million and 13 GILs with aggregate outstanding principal of 300.2 million. Most of these MRBs and the GILs were issued by various state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 78 multifamily and seniors housing properties containing a total of 13,241 rental units located in 16 states in the United States. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 74 MRBs with aggregate outstanding principal of 697.6 million and nine GILs with aggregate outstanding principal of 184.8 million. Most of these MRBs and the GILs were issued by various state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 76 multifamily and seniors housing properties containing a total of 12,584 rental units located in 17 states in the United States. 
 Our MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and certain property loans are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. One MRB is secured by ground, facility, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility in Tennessee. Property loans related to multifamily properties are also included in this segment and may or may not be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust.

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Total revenues increased for 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to: 
 An increase of approximately 6.0 million in interest income from recent MRB acquisitions, offset by a decrease of approximately 5.0 million in interest income from MRB investments due to redemptions and principal paydowns; 

An increase of approximately 6.8 million in interest income from higher GIL investment balances and higher average interest rates; 

An increase of approximately 5.1 million in other interest income due to additional property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investments and higher average interest rates; 

An increase of approximately 3.2 million in other interest income for payments received on redemption of the Ohio Properties, Live 929 Apartments, and Cross Creek property loans in 2022 that were previously in nonaccrual status; 

An increase of approximately 1.5 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Cross Creek MRB upon redemption at par in September 2022; 

An increase of approximately 1.4 million of other interest income due to increasing interest earned on cash balances; and 

A decrease of approximately 1.8 million in contingent interest income recognized in July 2021 upon the redemption of the Rosewood Townhomes Series A and South Pointe Apartments Series A MRBs. 

Total interest expense increased for 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to: 
 An increase of approximately 3.0 million due to an increase in the average outstanding principal of approximately 206.9 million; 

An increase of approximately 11.0 million due to higher average interest rates on variable-rate debt financing; 

An increase of approximately 1.1 million in amortization of deferred financing costs, which includes approximately 719,000 of previously unamortized deferred financing costs that were recognized as interest expense upon the redemption and reissuance of certain TOB financings during 2022; and 

A decrease of approximately 7.0 million due to an increase in the fair market value of interest rate derivative instruments attributable to rising market interest rates. 

Segment net income for 2022 increased as compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of the following factors: 
 The changes in total revenue and total interest expense detailed in the tables below; 

A decrease in the provision for credit loss of approximately 1.9 million related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in 2021; 

A decrease in the provision for loan loss of approximately 444,000 related to the Live 929 Apartments property loan in 2021; and 

An increase in general and administrative expenses related to increases of approximately 1.2 million in administration fees paid to AFCA2 due to greater assets under management, approximately 899,000 in employee salaries, bonuses and benefits, approximately 254,000 in restricted unit award compensation, approximately 140,000 in travel expenses, and approximately 107,000 in annual insurance premiums.

Operational Matters 
 The multifamily properties securing our MRBs were all current on contractual debt service payments on our MRBs and we have received no requests for forbearance of contractual debt service payments as of December 31, 2022. We continue to regularly discuss operations and potential lingering effect of COVID-19 with property owners and property management service providers of multifamily properties securing our MRBs. We have noted in conversations with certain property managers that rent payment relief programs were utilized by some of the tenant population during 2022. We did observe slight declines in occupancy and operating results at the multifamily properties securing our MRBs due to COVID-19. However, operating results, plus the availability of reserves, have allowed all properties to be current on contractual debt service payments. If property operating results significantly decline in the future, we may choose to provide support to the properties through supplemental property loans to prevent defaults on the related MRBs. 
 Our sole student housing property securing an MRB, Live 929 Apartments, was 91 occupied as of December 31, 2022, which is lower than the average occupancy of 95 during the school term from September 2021 through May 2022. However, the borrower has leased units at higher rental rates for the 2022-2023 academic year such that overall revenues are expected to increase. In January 2022, the borrower completed a restructuring of all senior debt secured by the property and the borrower was current on all contractual MRB principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2022. 
 The proton therapy center securing the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB was successfully sold out of bankruptcy in July 2022 and a liquidation plan is being finalized by the debtor and the bankruptcy court. We are entitled to approximately 9.2 of proceeds to all MRB holders. Our reported net carrying value of the MRB, inclusive of accrued interest, was 4.6 million for GAAP purposes as of December 31, 2022, and is our estimate of the proceeds we will ultimately receive upon liquidation. We received partial liquidation proceeds of 3.7 million in January 2023 and expect the remaining proceeds to be received at final liquidation. 
 Construction and rehabilitation activities continue at properties securing our GILs, taxable GILs and related property loans. Six of the 13 underlying affordable multifamily properties had commenced leasing operations as of December 31, 2022. To date, these properties have not experienced any material supply chain disruptions for either construction materials or labor or incurred material construction cost overruns. 
 46 

As many of our GIL investments and certain MRB investments have variable interest rates, we regularly monitor interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in each property s development budget, available construction budget contingency balances, and the funding of certain equity commitments by the owners of the underlying properties. Though original development budgets are sized to incorporate potential interest rate increases, the pace of recent interest rate increases has caused actual interest costs during construction to exceed original projections. We have noted that some properties that are complete or nearing completion have incurred interest costs that have exceeded capitalized interest reserves. In such instances, the developer has either reallocated other available reserves and contingencies, deferred their developer fees, or made direct cash payment during construction to ensure all interest is paid and avoid enforcement of our recourse guaranties against the developers and their affiliates. In addition, such projects have developer completion guaranties as well as capital contributed by LIHTC equity investors that will only receive their tax credits upon completion and stabilization of the projects. 
 Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments Segment 
 The Seniors and Skilled Nursing MRB Investments segment provides acquisition, construction and permanent financing for seniors housing and skilled nursing properties. Seniors housing consists of a combination of the independent living, assisted living and memory care units. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned one MRB with aggregate outstanding principal of 4.7 million, with an outstanding commitment to provide additional funding of 39.3 million on a draw-down basis during construction. This MRB was issued to finance the construction and stabilization of a combined independent living, assisted living and memory care property in Traverse City, MI, with 154 total units. Furthermore, in 2021 we funded a property loan secured by a skilled nursing facility in Houston, TX, which was redeemed in September 2022.

Operations in this segment began in December 2021. The Meadow Valley property securing our MRB is currently drawing on our investment commitment to fund construction costs. 
 Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments Segment 
 The Market-Rate Joint Venture Investments segment consists of our noncontrolling joint venture equity investments in market-rate multifamily properties, also referred to as our investments in unconsolidated entities or JV Equity Investments, and property loans due from market-rate multifamily properties. Our joint venture equity investments are passive in nature. Operational oversight of each property is controlled by our joint venture partner according to the entity s operating agreement. All properties are managed by a property management company affiliated with our joint venture partner. Decisions on when to sell an individual property are made by our joint venture partner based on its view of the local market conditions and current leasing trends. 
 An affiliate of our joint venture partner provides a guaranty of our preferred returns on our Vantage equity investments through a date approximately five years after commencement of construction. We account for our joint venture equity investments using the equity method and recognize our preferred returns during the hold period. Upon the sale of a property, net proceeds will be distributed according to the entity operating agreement. Sales proceeds distributed to us that represent previously unrecognized preferred return and gain on sale are recognized in net income upon receipt. Historically, the majority of income from our JV Equity Investments is recognized at the time of sale. As a result, we may experience significant income recognition in those quarters when a property is sold and our equity investment is redeemed.

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 The decrease in total revenues in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to the following factors: 
 An increase of approximately 2.2 million in investment income from equity contributed to JV Equity Investments during 2021 and 2022; 

A net decrease of approximately 3.2 million in investment income due to preferred return distributions from Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry in November 2021; 

Decreases of approximately 2.4 million, 1.4 million, and 862,000 of investment income recognized on the sales of Vantage at Powdersville, Vantage at Bulverde, and Vantage at Germantown in 2021; and 

A decrease of approximately 222,000 of investment income due to the sale of Vantage at Murfreesboro in March 2022. 

Interest expense for 2022 is related to our General LOC that is primarily secured by our JV Equity Investments. 
 The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for 2022 primarily consisted of the following: 
 The sale of Vantage at Murfreesboro in March 2022 for a gain of approximately 16.5 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Westover Hills in May 2022 for a gain of approximately 12.7 million; and 

The sale of Vantage at O'Connor in July 2022 for a gain of approximately 10.6 million. 

The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for 2021 primarily consisted of the following: 
 The sale of Vantage at Germantown in March 2021 for approximately 2.8 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Powdersville in May 2021 for approximately 5.5 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Bulverde in August 2021 for approximately 7.0 million; and 

Receipt of approximately 294,000 in November 2021 upon the resolution of gain contingencies related to the sale of Vantage at Panama City Beach in September 2019. 

The change in segment net income for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to the change in total revenues and gains on sales of unconsolidated entities discussed above. 
 Operational Matters 
 We have noted no material construction cost overruns to date, despite generally volatile market prices for construction materials, particularly lumber and commodities. In addition, we have noted no material issues in securing materials and labor needed to construct the properties underlying our JV Equity Investments, despite general supply chain constraints noted in the current business environment. The construction loans associated with our JV Equity Investments typically have variable interest rates, so we regularly monitor interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in each property s development budget and available construction budget contingency balances. Though original development budgets were sized to incorporate potential interest rate increases, the pace of recent interest rate increases has caused actual interest costs during construction to exceed original projections. We have noted that some properties that are complete or nearing completion have incurred interest costs that have exceeded capitalized interest reserves, but there are either sufficient construction contingencies or the developer has deferred a portion of its developer fees until completion or there are otherwise funds to pay the earned developer fee. Such interest costs overrun may, absent other developments, result in lower returns on our JV Equity Investments. 
 48 

As of December 31, 2022, three investments have stabilized occupancy of 90 or above: Vantage at Conroe, Vantage at Stone Creek, and Vantage at Coventry. Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry were sold in January 2023 with gains on sale totaling approximately 15.2 million that will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023. Vantage at Tomball and Vantage at Helotes have completed construction, are in the initial leasing phase, and are 79 and 57 occupied as of December 31, 2022, respectively. 
 In October and November 2022, we executed commitments for Freestone Greeley and Freestone Cresta Bella, each a to-be-constructed market-rate multifamily property. These are our first investments with the Freestone development group as managing member. The key principals of the Freestone development group were formerly affiliated with the Vantage development group and were closely involved in our 20 Vantage JV Equity Investments to date. The Freestone and Vantage development groups will work collaboratively together to bring the Partnership s eight remaining Vantage branded JV Equity Investments to completion and ultimate sale. The remaining key principals of the Vantage development group may present future JV Equity Investment opportunities to the Partnership, as may the Freestone development group. 
 In February 2023, we executed a 8.2 million commitment for Valage Senior Living Carson Valley, a to-be-constructed seniors housing property in Minden, NV. The structure of this JV Equity Investment is substantially the same as our Vantage and Freestone JV Equity Investments. The managing member of the property is an experienced seniors housing developer and operator. We believe our initiation of JV Equity Investments for seniors housing properties diversifies the exposure of our portfolio of JV Equity Investment while offering risk-adjusted returns similar to our current portfolio. 
 We continue to look for other opportunities to deploy capital in this segment. We are evaluating opportunities to expand beyond our traditional multifamily investment footprint in Texas. We are seeking other experienced joint venture partners for potential expansion into other markets, or other asset classes, in order to achieve more scale in this segment. 
 MF Properties Segment 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership owned the Suites on Paseo MF Property containing a total of 384 rental units. As of December 31, 2021, the Partnership also owned The 50/50 MF Property which was sold to an unrelated non-profit organization in December 2022.

Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 The increase in total revenues for 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily the result of an increase in revenue at the Suite on Paseo of approximately 760,000 due to higher occupancy as on-campus enrollment recovers from declines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately 116,000 due to the sale of the Partnership's ownership interest in The 50/50 MF property in December 2022. 
 The increase in real estate operating expense for 2022 as compared to 2021 is due primarily to an increase in general operating expenses and increasing variable costs as a result of higher occupancy, such as utilities and repairs and maintenance. 
 The decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in the average outstanding principal. 
 The improvement in segment net loss for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to the changes in total revenue and interest expense described above. Included in segment net loss is depreciation expense of 2.7 million for 2022 and 2021. 
 Operational Matters 
 In December 2022, we sold 100 of our ownership interest in The 50/50 MF Property to an unrelated non-profit organization. We received an unsecured property loan in return upon sale payable from future net cash flows of the property. The buyer assumed two mortgages payable associated with the property and we agreed to provide certain recourse support for the assumed mortgages. As a 
 49 

result of the sale, we deconsolidated The 50/50 MF Property in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of sale. We have deferred a gain on sale of approximately 6.6 million and will recognize the gain upon collection of principal of the unsecured property loan. 
 The Suites on Paseo has generated sufficient operating cash flows to meet all operational obligations through December 31, 2022. The Suites on Paseo MF Property, which is adjacent to San Diego State University, was 98 occupied as of December 31, 2022. 
 Discussion of Occupancy at Investment-Related Properties 
 The following tables summarize occupancy and other information regarding the properties underlying our various investment assets. The narrative discussion that follows provides a brief operating analysis of each investment asset class as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Non-Consolidated Properties - Stabilized 
 The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. These properties have met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table) as of December 31, 2022. Debt service on our MRBs for the non-consolidated stabilized properties was current as of December 31, 2022. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.

(1) Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement. 

(2) Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property. This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units. Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time. 

(3) A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90 physical occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for a period after construction completion or completion of the rehabilitation. 

(4) Prior year occupancy data is not available as the related investment was recently acquired and not owned by the Partnership during the prior year. 

(5) The MRB is defeased and as such, the Partnership does not report property occupancy information. 

Physical occupancy as of December 31, 2022 decreased slightly from the same period in 2021 due to slight declines across various properties in the portfolio. 
 Economic occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased slightly from the same period in 2021 in line with the decrease in physical occupancy. Significant property performance declines were noted at Decatur Angle and Bruton Apartments due to higher than historical bad debt reserve write-offs and decreased physical occupancy during certain months within 2022. Esperanza at Palo Alto and the Greens Property experienced significant economic occupancy declines due to increased loss to lease and decreased physical occupancy at Esperanza at Palo Alto. We will continue to monitor and discuss property operations with the individual borrowers. On an overall basis, we noted same-property maximum rental income amounts increased 7.2 in 2022 as compared to 2021, which is higher than historical annual rent increases. Net rental revenue will typically increase similarly though on a lag as rent increases will be realized upon annual lease renewals. This is consistent with our observed increase in same-property net rental revenue of 5.9 
 51 

in 2022 as compared to 2021. In the meantime, increasing maximum rental income amounts will contribute to a decline in economic occupancy even though property rental revenues are increasing overall. 
 Non-Consolidated Properties - Not Stabilized 
 The owners of the following residential properties do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of each VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2022, these residential properties have not met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table). As of December 31, 2022, debt service on the Partnership s MRBs and GILs for the non-consolidated, non-stabilized properties was current. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.

Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time. 

(3) The property is not considered stabilized as it has not met the criteria for stabilization. A property is considered stabilized once construction and/or rehabilitation is complete, it reaches 90 physical occupancy for 90 days, and it achieves 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for a certain period. 

(4) Physical and economic occupancy information is not available for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as the property is under construction or rehabilitation. 

(5) Physical and economic occupancy information is not available for the year ended December 31, 2021 as the related investment was under construction or rehabilitation. 

(6) Economic occupancy information is not available for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and physical occupancy information is not available as of December 31, 2021 as the related MRB was acquired in December 2022. 

As of December 31, 2022, three MRB multifamily properties and our sole MRB seniors housing property were under construction and have no operating metrics to report. The Ocotillo Springs MRB property has completed construction and is nearing stabilization. The Jackson Manor, The Park at Sondrio Apartments, and The Park at Vietti Apartments MRB properties are currently undergoing tenant-in-place rehabilitation. 
 52 

As of December 31, 2022, seven GIL properties were under construction and have no operating metrics to report. The remaining six GIL properties have substantially completed construction and are leasing units. 
 JV Equity Investments 
 We are the noncontrolling equity investor in various unconsolidated entities formed for the purpose of constructing market-rate, multifamily real estate properties. The Partnership determined the JV Equity Investments are VIEs but that the Partnership is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Partnership does not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. The one exception is Vantage at San Marcos, for which the Partnership is deemed the primary beneficiary and reports the entity's assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis. Our JV Equity Investments entitle us to shares of certain cash flows generated by the entities from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinance or sale.

Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time. 

The physical occupancy and economic occupancy as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased as compared to the same period in 2021 due to strong demand and lease-up efforts for the 2022-2023 academic year.

Discussion of Total Revenues and Other Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Investment income . The increase in investment income in 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to the following factors: 
 An increase of approximately 6.1 million in interest income from higher MRB investment balances and higher average interest rates, offset by a decrease of approximately 5.0 million in interest income from MRB investments due to redemptions and principal paydowns; 

An increase of approximately 6.8 million in interest income from higher GIL investment balances and higher average interest rates; 

An increase of approximately 1.5 million in interest income due to discount accretion on the Cross Creek MRB upon redemption at par in September 2022; and 

A decrease of approximately 5.8 million of investment income related to JV Equity Investments. This decrease consisted of: 

54 

o An increase of approximately 2.2 million in investment income from equity contributed to JV Equity Investments during 2021 and 2022; 

o A net decrease of approximately 3.2 million in investment income due to preferred return distributions from Vantage at Stone Creek and Vantage at Coventry in November 2021; 

o Decreases of approximately 2.4 million. 1.4 million, and 862,000 of investment income recognized on the sales of Vantage at Powdersville, Vantage at Bulverde, and Vantage at Germantown in 2021; and 

o A decrease of approximately 222,000 of investment income due to the sale of Vantage at Murfreesboro in March 2022. 

Property revenues . The increase in total revenues for 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily the result of an increase in revenue at the Suites on Paseo of approximately 760,000 due to higher occupancy as on-campus enrollment recovers from declines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately 116,000 due to the sale of the Partnership's ownership interest in The 50/50 MF property in December 2022. 
 Contingent interest income. There was no contingent interest income recognized for 2022. Contingent interest income recognized for 2021 was realized upon the redemption of the Rosewood Townhomes Series A and South Pointe Apartments Series A MRBs in July 2021. 
 Other interest income. Other interest income is comprised primarily of interest income on our property loan, taxable MRB, and taxable GIL investments. The increase in other interest income for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to the following: 
 An increase of approximately 5.7 million from higher average property loan, taxable MRB and taxable GIL investment balances of 103.1 million and higher average interest rates; 

An increase of approximately 3.2 million for payments received on redemption of the Ohio Properties, Live 929 Apartments and Cross Creek property loans in 2022 that were previously in nonaccrual status; and 

An increase of approximately 1.4 million of other interest income due to increasing interest earned on cash balances. 

Gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities. The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for 2022 primarily consisted of the following: 
 The sale of Vantage at Murfreesboro in March 2022 for a gain of approximately 16.5 million; 

The sale of Vantage at Westover Hills in May 2022 for a gain of approximately 12.7 million; and 

The sale of Vantage at O'Connor in July 2022 for a gain of approximately 10.6 million. 

The gain on sale of JV Equity Investments for 2021 primarily consisted of the following: 
 The sale of Vantage at Germantown in March 2021 for approximately 2.8 million;

Discussion of the Total Expenses for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Real estate operating expenses . Real estate operating expenses are related to MF Properties and are comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees. Real estate operating expenses increased for 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to general real estate operating expenses and increasing variable costs as a result of higher occupancy, such as utilities and repairs maintenance. 
 Provision for credit loss. There was no provision for credit loss recognized for 2022. The provision for credit loss for 2021 related to an other-than-temporary impairment of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB. 
 Provision for loan loss. There was no provision for loan loss recognized for 2022. The provision for loan loss for 2021 related to an increase in the loan loss allowance for the Live 929 Apartments property loan. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization relate primarily to the MF Properties. Depreciation and amortization expense was relatively consistent for 2022 as compared to 2021. 
 Interest expense . The decrease in interest expense for 2022 as compared to 2021 was due to the following factors: 
 An increase of approximately 3.1 million due to higher average principal outstanding of 208.1 million; 

An increase of approximately 11.1 million due to higher average interest rates on variable-rate and fixed-rate debt financing; 

An increase of approximately 1.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs, which includes approximately 719,000 of previously unamortized deferred financing costs that were recognized as interest expense upon the redemption and reissuance of certain TOB financings during 2022; and 

A decrease of approximately 7.0 million due to an increase in the fair market value of the Partnership's interest rate derivative instruments attributable to rising market interest rates. 

General and administrative expenses . The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily a result of the following factors: 
 An increase of approximately 1.2 million in administration fees paid to AFCA2 due to greater assets under management; 

An increase of approximately 897,000 in employee salaries, bonuses and benefits due to higher headcount and greater transactional bonuses; 

An increase of approximately 253,000 in restricted unit award compensation expense; 

An increase of approximately 140,000 in travel expenses as employees have recommenced traveling post-COVID-19; and 

An increase of approximately 107,000 in annual insurance premiums. 

Discussion of Income Tax Expense for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 A wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, the Greens Hold Co, is a corporation subject to federal and state income tax. The Greens Hold Co owns certain property loans. The Greens Hold Co sold its ownership interest in The 50/50 MF Property to an unrelated non-profit organization in December 2022 and deferred a gain on sale of approximately 6.6 million. There was minimal taxable income for the Greens Hold Co for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Cash Available for Distribution 
 The Partnership believes that Cash Available for Distribution CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit) and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 3 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by 
 56 

other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the one-for-three Reverse Unit Split and the BUCs Distributions on a retroactive basis for all periods presented):

(1) The provision for credit loss for 2021 relates to impairment of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB. 

(2) The provision for loan loss for 2021 relates to impairment of the Live 929 Apartments property loan. 

(3) This amount represents previous impairments recognized as adjustments to CAD in prior periods related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB. The property securing the MRB was sold in July 2022 with cash proceeds contributed to the bankruptcy estate. The borrower and the bankruptcy court are finalizing the liquidation plan for the settlement of all remaining assets and liabilities of the bankruptcy estate. Substantially all the assets of the borrower were liquidated in the third quarter of 2022 such that the Partnership s previously recognized impairments were effectively realized. 

(4) This amount represents previous impairments recognized as adjustments to CAD in prior periods related to the Cross Creek property loans. Such impairments were realized in the third quarter of 2022 upon the settlement of the outstanding balances. 

(5) As described in Note 3 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75 to the limited partners and BUC holders, as a class, and 25 to the General Partner. This adjustment represents the 25 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, Tier 2 income allocable to the General Partner consisted of approximately 3.2 million related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Murfreesboro in March 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Tier 2 income allocable to the general partner consisted of approximately 702,000 related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Germantown in March 2021, approximately 1.4 million related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Powdersville in May 2021, approximately 462,000 related to the redemption of Rosewood Townhomes Series A and South Pointe Apartments Series A MRBs in July 2021, and approximately 119,000 related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Bulverde in August 2021. This was offset by the loss on the sale of land held for development in Gardner, KS and realization of losses for prior impairments. 
 (6) The Partnership compared the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of the Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB as of March 31, 2022, which indicated a recovery of value. The Partnership will accrete the recovery of prior credit loss into investment income over the term of the MRB. The accretion of recovery of value is presented as a reduction to current CAD as the original provision for credit loss was an addback for CAD calculation purposes in the period recognized. 

(7) During 2022, the Partnership declared the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution and the Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution, each payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to 0.20 per BUC for outstanding BUC as of the respective record dates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We continually evaluate our potential sources and uses of liquidity, including current and potential future developments related to market interest rates and the general economic and geopolitical environment. The information below is based on our current 
 57 

expectations and projections about future events and financial trends, which could materially differ from actual results. See the discussion of Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report for further information. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months will be primarily operational expenses; investment commitments, net of leverage secured by the investment assets; debt service (principal and interest payments) related to our debt financings; repayments of our secured lines of credit balances; the potential exercise of redemption rights by the holders of the Series A Preferred Units; and distribution payments to Unitholders. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily using cash on hand, operating cash flows from our investments and an MF Property, and potentially additional debt financing issued in the normal course of business. In addition, we will consider the issuance of additional BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests in the Partnership based on needs and opportunities for executing our strategy. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements will be primarily for maturities of debt financings and mortgages payable; the potential exercise of redemption rights by the holders of the Series A Preferred Units; funding and purchase of additional investment assets, net of leverage secured by the investment assets. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through refinancing of maturing debt financings with the same or similar lenders; contractual principal and interest payments from investments in MRBs, GILs and property loans; and proceeds from asset sales and redemptions. In addition, we will consider the issuance of additional BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests in the Partnership based on needs and opportunities for executing our strategy. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Partnership s principal sources of liquidity consist of: 
 Unrestricted cash on hand; 

Operating cash flows from investments in investment assets; 

Net operating cash flows from our MF Property; 

Secured lines of credit; 

Proceeds from the sale or redemption of assets. 

Proceeds from obtaining additional debt; and 

Issuances of debt securities, BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, or other series of limited partnership interests. 

Unrestricted Cash on Hand 
 As of December 31, 2022, we reported unrestricted cash on hand of approximately 51.2 million. We are required to keep a minimum of 5.0 million of unrestricted cash on hand under the terms of certain guaranty obligations. There are no other contractual restrictions of our ability to use cash on hand. 
 Operating Cash Flows from Investments 
 Cash flows from operations are primarily comprised of regular principal and interest payments received on our investment assets that provide consistent cash receipts throughout the year. All MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs and property loans are current on contractual debt service payments as of December 31, 2022, except for the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB. Investment receipts, net of interest expense on related debt financings and lines of credit, are available for our general use. We also receive distributions from JV Equity Investments if, and when, cash is available for distribution. 
 Receipt of cash from our investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs, and JV Equity Investments is primarily dependent upon the generation of net cash flows at multifamily properties that underlie these investments. The underlying properties are subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate, which include (but are not limited to) reduced occupancy, tenant defaults, falling rental rates, and increasing operating expenses. 
 Receipt of cash from our investments in GILs, taxable GILs, and construction financing and mezzanine property loans is dependent on the availability of funds in the original development budgets. The current rising interest rate environment is resulting in higher interest costs for properties with variable rate construction financing. We regularly monitor interest costs in comparison to capitalized interest reserves in the property s development budget, available construction cost contingencies balances, and the funding of certain equity commitments by the owners of the underlying properties. The developers may also make cash payments to pay interest due to avoid claims under their payment and completion guaranties. 
 58 

Net Operating Cash Flows from our MF Property 
 Cash flows generated by the Suites on Paseo MF Property, net of operating expenses, are unrestricted for our use. Such cash flows are subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in student multifamily real estate, which include (but are not limited to) reduced occupancy, tenant defaults, falling rental rates, and increasing operating expenses. 
 Secured Lines of Credit 
 We maintain a secured line of credit General LOC with two financial institutions of up to 40.0 million to purchase additional investments and to meet general working capital and liquidity requirements. We may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts at any time through the maturity date, subject to the limitations of a borrowing base. The aggregate available commitment cannot exceed a borrowing base calculation, which is equal to 40 multiplied by the aggregate value of a pool of eligible encumbered assets. Eligible encumbered assets consist of (i) the net book value of the Suites on Paseo MF Property, and (ii) 100 of our equity capital contributions to Vantage JV Equity Investments, subject to certain limits and restrictions. The General LOC is secured by first priority security interests in our Vantage JV Equity Investments, a mortgage and assignment of leases and rents of the Suites on Paseo MF Property, and a security interest in a bank account at BankUnited, N.A., in which we must maintain a balance of not less than 5.0 million. We are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants that, among others, require us to maintain liquidity of not less than 5.0 million, maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 100.0 million, and to notify BankUnited, N.A. if our consolidated net worth declines by (a) more than 20 from the immediately preceding quarter, or (b) more than 35 from the date at the end of two consecutive calendar quarters ending immediately thereafter. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. The balance of the General LOC was 6.5 million with the ability to draw an additional 33.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The General LOC has a maturity date of June 2023, with options to extend for up to two additional years. 
 We maintain a secured non-operating line of credit Acquisition LOC with a financial institution of up to 50 million. The Acquisition LOC may be used to fund purchases of MRBs, taxable MRBs, or loans issued to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of affordable housing or which are otherwise secured by real estate or mortgage-backed securities (i.e., GILs, taxable GILs, and property loans). Advances on the Acquisition LOC are due on the 270th day following the advance date but may be extended for up to an additional 270 days by making certain payments. The Acquisition LOC contains a covenant, among others, that our senior debt will not exceed a specified percentage of the market value of our assets to be consistent with the Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Partnership). We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. There was an approximately 49.0 million outstanding balance on the Acquisition LOC and approximately 1.0 million was available as of December 31, 2022. The outstanding balance on the Acquisition LOC was entirely repaid in January 2023. The Acquisition LOC has a maturity date of June 2024, with two one-year extension options, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 Proceeds from the Sale or Redemption of Assets 
 We may, from time to time, sell or redeem our investments in MRBs, GILs, property loans, JV Equity Investments and MF Properties consistent with our strategic plans. Our MRB portfolio is marked at a premium to cost, adjusted for paydowns, primarily due to higher stated interest rates when compared to current market interest rates for similar investments. We may consider selling certain MRB investments in exchange for cash at prices that approximate our currently reported fair value. However, we are contractually prevented from selling the MRB investments included in our TEBS financings. 
 Our ability to dispose of investment assets on favorable terms is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to, the number of potential buyers and the availability of credit to such potential buyers to purchase investment assets at prices we consider acceptable. Recent volatility in market interest rates, recent inflation and the potential for an economic recession may negatively impact the potential prices we could realize upon the disposition of our various investment assets.

In March 2022, the Ohio Properties property loans were repaid in full. We received approximately 2.4 million of principal and approximately 4.3 million of accrued interest upon redemption. The Ohio Properties Series A MRB was redeemed in March 2022, though all principal proceeds were applied as a paydown of our M24 TEBS financing. The Ohio Properties Series B MRB was redeemed and we received approximately 3.5 million of principal and approximately 29,000 of accrued interest upon redemption. 
 In September 2022, the Cross Creek MRB and property loans were redeemed. We received approximately 771,000 of cash proceeds upon redemption of the MRB, with the remaining redemption proceeds used to pay down the outstanding principal balance of the M24 TEBS financing. We received additional proceeds of approximately 5.3 million upon redemption of the original Cross Creek property loans principal and accrued interest. 
 In October 2022, the Gateway Village and Lynnhaven Apartments MRBs were redeemed. We received approximately 6.0 million of cash proceeds upon redemption of the MRBs. Related TOB trust financings principal of 5.1 million was paid down in May 2022. 
 Proceeds from Obtaining Additional Debt 
 We hold certain investments that are not associated with our debt financings, mortgages payable, or secured LOCs. We may obtain leverage for these investments by posting the investments as security. As of December 31, 2022, our primary unleveraged assets were certain MRBs and taxable MRBs with outstanding principal totaling approximately 18.4 million. 
 Issuances of Debt Securities, BUCs, Series A-1 Preferred Units or Series B Preferred Units 
 We may, from time to time, issue additional BUCs, Preferred Units, or debt securities, in one or more offerings, at prices or quantities that are consistent with our strategic goals. In December 2022, the Partnership s Registration Statement on Form S-3 Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may, from time to time, offer and sell BUCs, Preferred Units, or debt securities, in one or more offerings, with a maximum aggregate offering price of 300.0 million. Debt securities issued under the Registration Statement may be senior or subordinate obligations of the Partnership. The Registration Statement will expire in December 2025. 
 We are currently party to a Capital on Demand TM Sales Agreement to offer and sell, from time to time at market prices on the date of sale, BUCs up to an aggregate offering price of 30 million via an at the market offering. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any BUCs under this program. We will continue to assess if and when to issue BUCs under this program going forward. 
 We have two registration statements on Form S-3 covering the offering of Preferred Units that have been declared effective by the SEC. The following table summarizes the Partnership's current Preferred Unit offerings:

(1) The Partnership is able to issue Series A-1 Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series A-1 Preferred Units, is no less than three times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. 

(2) The Partnership is able to issue Series B Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series B Preferred Units, is no less than two times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. 

In February 2023, we sold 800,000 Series A-1 Preferred Units under the offering referenced in the table above for gross proceeds of 8.0 million. 
 We may also designate and issue additional series of preferred units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.

Uses of Liquidity 
 Our principal uses of liquidity consist of: 
 General and administrative expenses; 

Investment funding commitments; 

Debt service on debt financings, Secured Notes, mortgages payable, and secured lines of credit; 

Distributions paid to holders of Preferred Units and BUCs; 

Potential redemptions of Series A Preferred Units; and 

Other contractual obligations. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 We use cash to pay general and administrative expenses of our operations and real estate operating expenses of our MF Properties. For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in this report, and the section captioned Cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows set forth in Item 8 of this Report. General and administrative expenses are typically paid from unrestricted cash on hand and operating cash flows. 
 Investment Funding Commitments 
 Our overall strategy is to invest in quality multifamily properties through the acquisition of MRBs, GILs, property loans and JV Equity Investments in both existing and new markets. We evaluate investment opportunities based on, but not limited to, our market outlook, including general economic conditions, development opportunities and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, access to long-term financing sources, and the availability of investment capital. We may commit to fund additional investments on a draw-down or forward basis. The following table summarizes our outstanding investment commitments as of December 31, 2022:

(1) Projected fundings by year are based on current estimates and the actual funding schedule may differ materially due to, but not limited to, the pace of construction, adverse weather conditions, delays in governmental approvals or permits, the availability of materials and contractors, and labor disputes. 

(2) The variable index interest rate components are typically subject to floors that range from 0 to 0.85 . 

(3) We have securitized the indicated assets in TOB financing facilities that allow for additional principal proceeds as the remaining investment commitments are funded by us. See Note 15 for further details on debt financing. 

(4) Upon stabilization, the MRB will convert to a fixed rate of 8.0 and become subordinate to the other senior MRBs of the borrower. 

(5) The borrower may elect to extend the maturity date for up to six months upon meeting certain conditions, which may include payment of a non-refundable extension fee. 

(6) The initial draw on this investment was funded with available cash or proceeds from the Acquisition LOC. In January 2023, the Residency at Empire MRBs were securitized in a TOB trust financing facility that allow for additional principal proceeds as the remaining investment commitments are funded by us. 

(7) The property became a consolidated VIE effective during the fourth quarter of 2021. 

(8) This is the estimated closing date of the associated bond purchase commitment. 

(9) In December 2029, the interest rate will reset to the greater of (i) 3.25 over the then 10-Year SOFR Swap rate, or (ii) 6.00 . 

(10) A development site has been identified for this property but construction had not commenced as of December 31, 2022. 

(11) Upon stabilization, the MRB will resize to an amount not to exceed 3.3 million and become subordinate to the other senior MRBs of the borrower. In December 2029, the interest rate will convert to a fixed rate of 10.0 .

Debt Service on Debt Financings, Secured Notes, Mortgages Payable and Secured Lines of Credit 
 Our debt financing arrangements consist of various secured financing transactions to leverage our portfolio of MRB, taxable MRB, GIL, taxable GIL, and certain property loan investment assets. The financing arrangements generally involve the securitization of these investment assets into trusts whereby we retain beneficial interests in the trusts that provide us certain rights to the underlying investment assets. The senior securities are sold to unaffiliated parties in exchange for debt proceeds. The senior securities require periodic interest payments that may be fixed or variable, depending on the terms of the arrangement, and scheduled principal payments. We are required to fund any shortfall in principal and interest payable to the senior securities of the TEBS financings in the case of non-payment, forbearance or default of the borrowers contractual debt service payments of the related MRBs, up to the value of our residual interests. In the case of forbearance or default on an underlying investment asset in a term TOB or TOB trust financing, we may be required to fund shortfalls in principal and interest payable to the senior securities, repurchase a portion of the outstanding securities, or repurchase the underlying investment asset and seek alternative financing. We anticipate that cash flows from the securitized investment assets will fund normal, recurring principal and interest payments to the senior securities and all trust-related fees. 
 Our debt financing arrangements include various fixed and variable debt arrangements. Recent increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in increases in the interest costs associated with our variable debt financing arrangements. We actively manage our portfolio of fixed and variable rate debt financings and our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The following table summarizes our fixed and variable rate debt financings as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

(1) The securitized assets and related debt financings each have variable interest rates, though the variable rate indices may differ on individual transactions. As such, the Partnership is largely hedged against rising interest rates. 

(2) The variable-rate debt financing is hedged through our interest rate swap agreements. Though the variable rate indices may differ, these interest rate swaps have effectively synthetically fixed the interest rate of the related debt financing. See further discussion of our interest rate hedging activities below. 

The interest rate paid on our variable debt financings are generally determined by the senior trust certificate remarketing agent as the rate necessary to remarket any senior trust securities tendered by holders thereof for remarketing that week at a price of par. Interest on the senior securities is either taxable or tax-exempt to the holders based on the structure of the TOB financing. The senior securities rate on TOB financings structured as tax-exempt to the senior securities holders are typically correlated to tax-exempt municipal short-term securities indices, such as SIFMA. The senior securities rate on TOB financings structured as taxable to the senior securities holders are typically correlated to taxable short-term securities indices, such as SOFR. 
 We have hedged a portion of our overall exposure to changes in market interest rates on our variable-rate debt financings through five interest rate swaps. Our interest rate swaps are subject to monthly settlements whereby we pay a stated fixed rate and our counterparty pays a variable rate equal to the compounded SOFR rate for the settlement period. 
 The majority of our variable-rate debt financings that are hedged through interest rate swaps have interest that is tax-exempt to the senior securities holders. In order to account for the differential between our interest rate swaps which are indexed to SOFR (a taxable rate) and our debt financing rate (which is correlated to short-term tax-exempt municipal securities rates), we assume that, over the term of our debt financing, the tax-exempt senior securities interest rate will approximate 70 of the SOFR rate. This assumption aligns with common market assumptions and the historical correlation between taxable and tax-exempt municipal short-term securities rates. However, such ratio may not be accurate in the short term or long term in the future. We apply a 70 conversion ratio when determining the notional amount of our interest rate swaps such that, as an example, a 7.0 million notional amount indexed to SOFR is the equivalent to 10.0 million notional amount for tax-exempt debt financing. As such, the reported amount of variable debt financing in the table above exceeds the stated notional amount of the SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2022. The following 
 63 

table summarizes the average stated SOFR-denominated notional amount by year for our existing interest rate swaps (does not consider our assumed 70 ratio of tax-exempt municipal securities rates to SOFR):

The table above includes three interest rate swaps with forward starting dates in 2023. These interest rate swaps were executed in December 2022 to hedge variable rate TOB financing costs beginning in January 2023. 
 We may be required to post collateral if the value of investment assets securitized in TOB trust financings, plus our net exposure on our interest rate derivatives, drops below a threshold level in the aggregate. We experienced 23 separate collateral calls totaling 12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 due to volatility in asset and derivative pricing. All collateral was subsequently returned to us as of December 31, 2022 due to recoveries in asset and derivative valuations. We were able to meet all collateral posting requirements with unrestricted cash on hand. Continuing volatility in market interest rates and potential deterioration of general economic conditions may cause the value of our investment assets to decline and result in the posting of additional collateral in the future. Our Secured Notes are secured by the cash flows from the residual certificates of our TEBS financings. Interest due on the Secured Notes, net of amounts due to the Partnership on the related total return swap transactions, will be paid from receipts related to the TEBS financing residual certificates. Future receipts of principal related to the TEBS financing residual certificates will be used to pay down the principal of the Secured Notes. The Partnership has guaranteed the payment and performance of the responsibilities required under the Secured Notes and related documents. 
 Our General LOC and Acquisition LOC require monthly interest payments on outstanding balances and certain quarterly commitment fees. Such obligations are paid primarily from operating cash flows. The Acquisition LOC requires principal payments as previously described in this Item 2. The General LOC does not require principal payments until maturity in June 2023 as long as the outstanding principal does not exceed the borrowing base calculation.

When possible, we structure the debt financing maturity dates associated with our GIL, taxable GIL, and property loan investments to match the investment maturity dates such that investment redemption proceeds will paydown the outstanding debt financing. 
 See Item 7a, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Report for additional details. 
 Distributions Paid to Holders of Preferred Units and BUCs 
 Distributions to the holders of Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred, if declared by the General Partner, are paid quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 3.0 . If the Partnership were to issue Series B Preferred Units, holders of such units will be paid quarterly distributions, if declared by the General Partner, at an annual fixed rate of 3.4 . The Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units are non-cumulative, non-voting and non-convertible. 
 On December 19, 2022, we announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager, which is the general partner of the General Partner, declared a regular quarterly cash distribution of 0.37 per BUC and a supplemental cash distribution of 0.10 per BUC to unitholders of record on December 30, 2022 and payable on January 31, 2023. In addition, we distributed 0.20 per BUC in the form of additional BUCs. 
 64 

The Partnership and its General Partner continually assess the level of distributions for the Preferred Units and BUCs based on cash available for distribution, financial performance and other factors considered relevant. 
 Potential Redemptions of Series A Preferred Units 
 Upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series A Preferred Units to a subscriber, and upon each anniversary thereafter, each holder of Series A Preferred Units has the right to redeem, in whole or in part, the Series A Preferred Units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to 10.00 per unit plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid distributions through the date of the redemption. The next optional redemption dates for the currently outstanding Series A Preferred Units range from August 2023 through March 2024 and the holders must provide notice of the election to redeem no less than 180 days prior to such redemption dates. If the holders of the Series A Preferred Units elect to redeem, we will be required, subject to certain restrictions, to secure funds to redeem from unrestricted cash on hand, proceeds from our General LOC, additional borrowings or through additional capital raising options. 
 No holders had given notice of their election to redeem Series A Preferred Units as of December 31, 2022. However, in February 2023, we received notice from a holder of 2,000,000 Series A Preferred Units of its intent to redeem all its Series A Preferred Units. We anticipate paying redemption proceeds of 20.0 million in August 2023. 
 In July 2021, our registration statement on Form S-4 (the Form S-4 to register the offering and issuance of up to 9,450,000 of Series A-1 Preferred Units under a shelf registration process was declared effective by the SEC. The Form 4 was subsequently amended pursuant to a Post-Effective Amendment to the Form S-4, which was declared effective by the Commission on April 13, 2022. Under this offering, the Partnership may issue up to 9,450,000 Series A-1 Preferred Units in exchange for the Partnership s outstanding Series A Preferred Units. If unitholders elect to exchange Series A Preferred Units for Series A-1 Preferred Units, the new Series A-1 Preferred Units will not be eligible for redemption until the sixth anniversary of the date of the exchange, except in certain limited circumstances. In April 2022 and October 2022, we issued 2,000,000 and 1,000,000 Series A-1 Preferred Units in exchange for 2,000,000 and 1,000,000 outstanding Series A Preferred Units, respectively, held by two financial institutions pursuant to the Form S-4 offering. 
 In February 2023, we issued 700,000 Series A-1 Preferred Units in exchange for 700,000 outstanding Series A Preferred Units held by a financial institution pursuant to the Form S-4 offering. The remaining 5,750,000 of outstanding Series A Preferred Units are eligible for exchange under the registration statement on the Form S-4 through July 2023. 
 Other Contractual Obligations 
 We are subject to various guaranty obligations in the normal course of business, and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments. 
 Cash Flows 
 In 2022, we used cash of 59.3 million, which was the net result of 21.1 million provided by operating activities, 278.6 million used in investing activities, and 198.2 million provided by financing activities. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 21.1 million in 2022 compared to 33.9 million generated in 2021. The change was due to the following factors: 
 An increase of 27.5 million in net income, offset by the 24.3 million adjustment for the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities that is considered cash from investing activities; 

A decrease of 7.2 million related to the unrealized gain on interest rate derivatives; 

A decrease of 7.1 million related to changes in the preferred return receivable from unconsolidated entities; 

A decrease of 1.7 million related to the amortization of bond premium, discount and origination fees; 

A total decrease of 2.3 million in non-cash provisions for credit loss and loan loss; 

An increase of 1.8 million adjustment for contingent interest that is considered cash from investing activities; and 

An increase of 1.3 million related to the amortization of deferred financing costs. 

65 

Cash used in investing activities totaled 278.6 million in 2022 compared to cash used of 187.5 million in 2021. The change was due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of 113.1 million of cash due to MRB acquisitions and draw-down funding, offset by an increase of 57.3 million of cash due to MRB paydowns and redemptions; 

A decrease of 75.4 million of cash due to continued advances on property loans, offset by an increase of 30.1 million due to property loan principal payments received; 

A decrease of 11.7 million of cash due to taxable MRB acquisitions and draw-down funding; 

A decrease of 6.0 million of cash due to advances on taxable GILs; 

An decrease of 1.7 million of cash due to capital expenditures; 

An increase of 21.5 million of cash due to greater proceeds from the sale of JV Equity Investments; 

An increase of 4.4 million of cash due to lower fundings on GILs; and 

An increase of 3.7 million of cash due to lower contributions to unconsolidated entities. 

Cash provided by financing activities totaled 198.2 million in 2022 compared to cash provided of 182.5 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to the following factors: 
 A decrease of 31.2 million of cash related to proceeds from the sale of BUCs in September 2021; 

A net decrease of 35.9 million of cash due to an increase in payments on the secured lines of credit; 

A decrease of 18.0 million of cash due to greater distributions paid; 

A net increase of 92.3 million of cash due to proceeds from debt financing; 

A net increase of 7.5 million of cash due to a decrease in payments on the terminated unsecured line of credit; and 

An increase of 1.4 million of cash related to the repurchase of BUCs in May 2021. 

We believe our cash balance and cash provided by the sources discussed herein will be sufficient to pay, or refinance, our debt obligations and to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. 
 Leverage Ratio 
 We set target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us. Those constraints are dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to mark-to-market with collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financed collateral. We use target constraints for each type of financing to manage to an overall maximum leverage level (the Leverage Ratio ), as established by the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager. In February 2023, the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager approved an increase in the maximum Leverage Ratio from 75 to 80 . The Board of Managers of Greystone Manager retains the right to change the maximum Leverage Ratio in the future based on the consideration of factors the Board of Managers considers relevant. We calculate our Leverage Ratio as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using cost adjusted for paydowns for MRBs, GILs, property loans, taxable MRBs and taxable GILs, and initial cost for deferred financing costs and real estate assets. As of December 31, 2022, our overall Leverage Ratio was approximately 73 . 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held MRB, GIL, taxable MRB, taxable GIL, and certain property loan investments that are secured by affordable multifamily and seniors housing properties and one commercial property, which are owned by entities that are not controlled by us. We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities. 
 We have entered into various commitments and guaranties. For additional discussions related to commitments and guaranties, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties, other than those disclosed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 and 23 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates because they involve our judgments, assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements may be material. 
 Variable Interest Entities 
 Under the accounting guidance for consolidation, we must evaluate entities in which we hold a variable interest to determine if the entities are VIEs and if we are the primary beneficiary. A VIE s primary beneficiary is the entity that is deemed to have: (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then we must consolidate the VIEs in its consolidated financial statements. We have consolidated all VIEs where we are deemed the primary beneficiary. All transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation when preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
 We reevaluate VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs. As a result, changes to the consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances. The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment. 
 We do not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP impacts its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership. In addition, the consolidation of VIEs is not expected to impact the treatment of our investment assets owned by consolidated VIEs, the tax-exempt nature of the interest payments on secured debt financings, or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Schedule K-1. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance: 
 Defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and 

Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. 

Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows: 
 Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2 - inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and 

Level 3 - inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities. 

The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
 Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds 
 The fair value of the Partnership s investments in MRBs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, is based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing services, which are estimates of market prices. There is no active trading market for these securities, and price quotes 
 67 

for the securities are not available. The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing services incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of each security as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, illiquidity, legal structure of the borrower, collateral, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying property, geographic location, and property quality. These characteristics are used to estimate an effective yield for each security. The security fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis by applying the effective yield to contractual cash flows. Significant increases (decreases) in the effective yield would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate. Changes in fair value due to an increase or decrease in the effective yield do not impact the Partnership s cash flows. 
 See the Partnership`s Mortgage Revenue Bonds Sensitivity Analysis in Item 7A for further analysis on the impact of hypothetical changes in effective yield on the fair value of our MRBs. 
 The Partnership evaluates pricing data received from the third-party pricing services by evaluating consistency with information from either the third-party pricing services or public sources. The fair value estimates of the MRBs are based largely on unobservable inputs believed to be used by market participants and requires the use of judgment on the part of the third-party pricing services and the Partnership. Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s investments in MRBs are categorized as Level 3 assets. 
 Mortgage Revenue Bond Impairment 
 The Partnership accounts for its investments in MRBs under the accounting guidance for certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale debt securities and are reported at their estimated fair value. The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reflected in the Partnership s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral. 
 The Partnership periodically reviews its MRBs for impairment. The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary impairments based on various factors including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: 
 The duration and severity of the decline in fair value; 

The Partnership s intent to hold and the likelihood of it being required to sell the security before its value recovers; 

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its collateral, or both; 

Volatility of the fair value of the security; 

The likelihood of the borrower being able to make scheduled interest or principal payments; 

Failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and 

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date. 

While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost. If a MRB s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, and the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the MRB prior to the time that its value recovers or until maturity, the Partnership will record an other-than-temporary impairment through earnings equal to the difference between the MRB s carrying value and its fair value. If the Partnership does not expect to sell an other-than-temporarily impaired MRB, only the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized through earnings as a provision for credit loss, with the remainder recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). In determining the provision for credit loss, the Partnership compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the MRB s amortized cost basis. 
 The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provision for credit loss, and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its MRB portfolio, the Partnership may incur other-than-temporary impairments or provision for credit losses that could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings. 
 68 

Governmental Issuer Loan Impairment 
 The Partnership accounts for its investment in governmental issuer loans GILs under the accounting guidance for certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Partnership s investment in these instruments are classified as held-to-maturity debt securities and are reported at amortized cost. 
 The Partnership periodically reviews its GILs for impairment. The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary impairments based on various factors including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: 
 The duration and severity of the decline in fair value; 

The Partnership s intent to hold and the likelihood of it being required to sell the security before its value recovers; 

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its collateral, or both; 

Volatility of the fair value of the security; 

The likelihood of the borrower being able to make scheduled interest or principal payments; 

The failure of the borrower to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and 

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date. 

While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost. If a GIL s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, and the Partnership does not expect to recover its entire amortized cost, only the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized through earnings as a provision for credit loss, with the remainder recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). 
 The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provision for credit loss, and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the value of its GILs, the Partnership may incur other-than-temporary impairments or provision for credit losses that could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings. 
 Impairment of JV Equity Investments 
 The Partnership reviews its investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Factors considered include: 
 The absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment; 

The inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment; or 

Estimated sales proceeds that are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment. 

The Partnership s assessment of whether a decline in value is other than temporary is based on the Partnership s ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment. 
 Property Loans, Net of Loan Loss Allowance 
 The Partnership invests in property loans made to the owners of certain multifamily, student housing and skilled nursing properties. Most of the property loans have been made to multifamily properties that secure MRBs and GILs owned by the Partnership. The Partnership recognizes interest income on the property loans as earned and the interest income is reported within Other interest income on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is not recognized for property loans that are deemed to be in nonaccrual status. The repayment of these property loans and accrued interest is dependent largely on the cash flows or proceeds upon sale or refinancing of the related property. The Partnership periodically evaluates these loans for potential impairment by estimating the fair value of the related property and comparing the fair value to the outstanding MRBs, GILs or other senior financing, plus the Partnership s property loans. The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model that considers varying assumptions. The discounted cash flow analysis may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates. The Partnership may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property s fair value. 
 69 

If the estimated fair value of the related property, after deducting the amortized cost basis of the MRB, GIL or other senior financing, exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded. If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is recognized. The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment. 
 Real Estate Assets Impairment 
 The Partnership reviews real estate assets, including our MF Property, for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of a real estate asset may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount of the real estate asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The primary components of our market risk at December 31, 2022 are related to interest rate risk and credit risk. Our exposure to market risks relates primarily to our investments in MRBs, GILs, property loans and our debt financing. We seek to actively manage these and other risks and to acquire and hold assets that we believe justify bearing those risks, and to maintain capital levels consistent with those risks. 
 The current rising interest rate environment, the recent inflationary environment, and the risk of a potential recession have contributed to increasing market risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The year ended December 31, 2022 was a volatile period for the fixed income markets as the Federal Reserve announced Federal Funds Rate increases totaling 425 basis points and signaled additional future short term interest rate increases to combat inflation in the broader economy. In February 2023, the Federal Reserve announced an additional 25 basis point increase in short term interest rates and indicated ongoing increases in interest rates will be likely. The Federal Reserve has also stated its intention to reduce its balance sheet of US treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities which may cause further upward pressure on interest rates. Increases in short-term interest rates will generally result in similar increases in the interest cost associated with our variable debt financing arrangements. 
 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. The nature of our MRB, GIL, and property loan investments and the debt used to finance these investments exposes us to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The majority of our MRB investments bear interest at fixed rates. Our GIL and property loan investments predominantly bear interest at variable rates and all are subject to interest rate floors. 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the impact on our net interest income assuming various changes in short-term interest rates as of December 31, 2022:

The interest rate sensitivity table above (the Table represents the change in interest income from investments, net of interest on debt and settlement payments for interest rate derivatives over the next twelve months, assuming an immediate parallel shift in the LIBOR yield curve and the resulting implied forward rates are realized as a component of this shift in the curve. Assumptions include anticipated interest rates; relationships between different interest rate indices such as SOFR, LIBOR and SIFMA; and outstanding investment, debt financing and interest rate derivative positions. No assurance can be made that the assumptions included in the Table presented herein will occur or that other events will not occur that will affect the outcomes of the analysis. Furthermore, the results included in the Table assume we do not act to change our sensitivity to the movement in interest rates. As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2022, it does not consider those exposures or positions that have arisen or could arise after that date. The ultimate economic impact of these market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our risk mitigation strategies at that time and the overall business and economic environment. 
 We employ leverage to fund the acquisition of many of our fixed income assets. Approximately 75 of our leverage bears interest at short term variable interest rates. Our remaining 25 of leverage has fixed interest rates. Of those assets funded with short term variable rate debt facilities, more than half bear interest at a variable rate as well. While there is some basis risk between the interest cost associated with our debt financing arrangements and the short-term interest rate indices on our variable rate assets, this portion of our portfolio is substantially match funded with rising short term interest rates having a minimal impact on our net interest income. 
 For those fixed rate assets where we have variable rate funding, hedging instruments such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps have been utilized to hedge some, but not all, of the potential increases in our funding cost that would result from higher short term interest rates. In some cases, these positions have been hedged to their expected maturity date. In others, a shorter-term hedge has been executed due to uncertainty regarding the time period over which the individual fixed rate asset might be outstanding. 
 73 

LIBOR and certain other variable rate benchmark indices to which some of our asset and liabilities remain tied, are the subject of recent national, international, and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The ICE Benchmark Association, or IBA, intends to cease publication of our relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately after June 30, 2023. Further, on March 15, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, was signed into law in the U.S. This legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts that mature after June 30, 2023 which do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. 
 The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified the SOFR index as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, LIBOR indices are utilized as the variable benchmark rate on one MRB, one taxable MRB, three property loans, and our General LOC. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from USD LIBOR proceeds. Despite the LIBOR transition in various markets, multi-rate environments may persist in the near term as regulators and working groups have suggested market participants adopt alternative reference rates. 
 For information on our debt financing and interest rate derivatives see Notes 15 and 17, respectively. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our primary credit risk is the risk of default on our investment in MRBs, GILs and property loans collateralized by multifamily residential, seniors housing and skilled nursing properties. The MRB and GIL investments are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issue the MRB or GIL and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any issuer. In addition, the MRB, GIL, and the associated property loan investments are non-recourse obligations of the property owner. As a result, the primary sources of principal and interest payments on our MRB, GIL, and the property loan investments are the net operating cash flows generated by these properties or the net proceeds from a sale or refinance of these properties. Affiliates of the borrowers of our GIL and construction financing property loan investments have full to limited guaranties of construction completion and payment of principal and accrued interest on the GIL and property loan investments, so we may have additional recourse options for these investments. 
 If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on our MRB, GIL or property loan investments, a default may occur. A property s ability to generate net operating cash flows is subject to a variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of its operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential, single-family rentals, seniors housing and skilled nursing properties in the market area where the property is located. This is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes. In addition, factors such as government regulation (e.g. zoning laws and permitting requirements), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor issues, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property. Rental rates for set-aside units at affordable multifamily properties are typically tied to certain percentages of the area median income. Increases in area median income are not necessarily correlated to inflationary increases in operating expenses. A significant mismatch between area median income growth and increased property operating expenses could negatively impact net operating cash flows available to pay debt service. If AMI declines on a year-over-year basis, rents could need to be reduced. 
 Certain MRB, GIL, and construction financing property loan investments fund the construction of new affordable multifamily properties and have variable interest rates. Since there are little to no operating cash flows during the construction and lease-up periods for new properties, borrowers utilize capitalized interest reserves to fund debt service prior to stabilization. Increases in market interest rates will cause an increase in debt service costs. If interest rate increases are large enough, such capitalized interest reserves and other budgeted contingencies may be insufficient to pay all debt service through stabilization. Such cost overruns may cause defaults on our construction financing investments if other funding sources are not available to the borrowers or if related guarantors fail to meet their obligations. 
 Defaults on our MRB, GIL, or property loans investments may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to Unitholders. In addition, if a property s net operating cash flow declines, it may affect the market value of the property, which may result in net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property to be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of our MRB, GIL or property loan investment. In the event of a default, we will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust on the property securing the investment. If we take ownership of the property securing a defaulted MRB or GIL investment, we will be entitled to all net operating cash flows generated by the property and will be subject to risks associated with ownership of multifamily real estate. If such an event occurs, these investments will not provide tax-exempt income. 
 74 

We actively manage the credit risks associated with our MRB, GIL, and property loan investments by performing a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the owners and properties securing these investments prior to investing. In addition, we carefully monitor the on-going performance of the properties underlying these investments. 
 Credit risk is also present in the geographical concentration of the properties securing our MRB investments. We have significant geographic concentrations in Texas, California, and South Carolina. The table below summarizes the geographic concentrations in these states as a percentage of the total MRB principal outstanding:

Mortgage Revenue Bonds Sensitivity Analysis 
 Third-party pricing services are used to value our MRB investments. The pricing service uses a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis which encompasses judgment in its application. The key assumption in the yield to maturity or call analysis is the range of effective yields of the individual MRB investments. The effective yield analysis for each MRB considers the current market yield of similar securities, specific terms of each MRB, and various characteristics of the property collateralizing the MRB such as debt service coverage ratio, loan to value, and other characteristics. 
 We completed a sensitivity analysis which is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time. The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution. The table below summarizes the sensitivity analysis metrics related to our MRB investments as of December 31, 2022:

Reinvestment Risk 
 MRB investments may have optional call features that may be exercised by either the borrower or the Partnership that are earlier than the contractual maturity. These optional call features may be at either par or premiums to par. In addition, our GIL and most property loan investments are prepayable at any time without penalty. Borrowers may choose to redeem our investments if prevailing market interest rates are lower than the interest rate on our investment asset or for other reasons. In order to maintain or grow our investment portfolio size and earnings, we must reinvest repayment proceeds in new assets. New MRB, GIL and property loan investment opportunities may not generate the same returns as our current investments such that our reported operating results may decline over time. In addition, rising interest rates and construction costs could limit the ability of developers to initiate new projects for us to finance with MRB, GIL, and property loan investments. 
 Similarly, we are subject to reinvestment risk on the return of capital from sales of JV Equity Investments. Our strategy involves making JV Equity Investments for the development, stabilization and sale of market-rate multifamily rental properties. Our initial equity contributions are returned upon sale of the underlying properties, at which time we will look to reinvest the capital into new JV equity Investments or other investments. Fewer new investment opportunities of this kind may result from negative changes in various economic factors and those new investments that we do make may not generate the same returns as our prior investments due to factors including, but not limited to, increasing competition in the development of market-rate multifamily rental properties, rising interest rates and increasing construction costs. Lower returns on new investment opportunities will result in declining operating results over time.

Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data. 
 Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC and Partners of 
 Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP and its subsidiaries (the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of partners' capital and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Valuation of Level 3 Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Mortgage Revenue Bonds Held in Trust 
 As described in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the estimated fair value of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage revenue bonds held in trust (collectively referred to as MRBs is 799.4 million or approximately 51 of the Partnership s total assets as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates the fair value of MRBs based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing services, which are estimates of market prices. There is no active trading market for the MRBs, and price quotes for the MRBs are not available. The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing services incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of each MRB as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, illiquidity, legal structure of the borrower, collateral, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying property, geographic location, and property quality. These characteristics are used to estimate an effective yield for each MRB. The MRB fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis by applying the effective yield to contractual cash flows. 
 76 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of level 3 MRBs is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management to determine the fair value of these investments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the effective yield based on the applicable underlying characteristics of each MRB, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the valuation provided by management; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s valuation methodology; and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent range of fair value estimates and comparison of management s estimate to the independently developed range. Developing the independent range involved developing a range of independent effective yields based on the applicable underlying characteristics of each MRB.

 of the highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency. The Partnership Agreement also allows the Partnership to invest in other securities whose interest may be taxable for federal income tax purposes. Total tax-exempt investments and other investments cannot exceed of the Partnership's total assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Partnership Agreement. Tax-exempt investments and other investments primarily consist of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated entities. In addition, the amount of other investments is limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. AFCA 2 is the sole general partner of the Partnership. Greystone Manager, the general partner of AFCA 2, an affiliate of Greystone Co. II LLC (collectively with its affiliates, Greystone ).

 The Partnership also consolidates variable interest entities VIEs in which the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
 
 basis points during 2022 and an additional basis point increase in February 2023. The Federal Reserve has signaled further future short-term interest rate increases to combat inflation in the broader economy. In addition, geopolitical conflicts continue to impact the general global economic environment. These factors have caused volatility in the fixed income markets, which has impacted the value of some of the Partnership s investment assets, particularly those with fixed interest rates. In addition, increases in short-term interest rates will generally result in increases in the interest cost associated with the Partnership s variable rate debt financing arrangements and for construction debt of properties underlying our investments in unconsolidated entities. The extent to which general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions will impact the Partnership s financial condition or results of operations in the future is uncertain and actual results and outcomes could differ from current estimates. The current inflationary environment in the United States may increase operating expenses at properties securing the Partnership s investments and general operations, which may reduce net operating results of the related properties and result in lower debt service coverage or higher than anticipated capitalized interest requirements for properties under construction. Such occurrences may negatively impact the value of the Partnership s investments. Higher general and administrative expenses of the Partnership and real estate operating expenses of the MF Properties may adversely affect the Partnership s operating results, including a reduction in net income. Furthermore, the potential for an economic recession either globally or locally in the U.S. or other economies could further impact the valuation of our investment assets, limit the Partnership s ability to obtain additional debt financing from lenders, and limit opportunities for additional investments. 

limit. The Partnership may from time to time invest in short-term investment grade securities. The Partnership is exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties, though such risk is minimal and the Partnership does not anticipate any non-performance. 
 
 While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost. If the estimated fair value of a GIL or taxable GIL is below amortized cost, and the Partnership does not expect to recover its entire amortized cost, only the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized through earnings as a provision for credit loss, with the remainder recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provision for credit loss, and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the value of its GILs or taxable GILs, the Partnership may incur other-than-temporary impairments or provision for credit losses that could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings. Real Estate Assets The Partnership s investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally - years on multifamily and student housing residential apartment buildings, and five to years on capital improvements. Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The Partnership also holds land held for investment and development which is reported at cost. The Partnership recognizes gains and losses equal to the difference between proceeds on sale and the net carrying value of the assets at the date of disposition. The Partnership reviews real estate assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of a real estate asset may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount of the real estate asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The Partnership accounts for its investments in unconsolidated entities under the equity method of accounting. Through ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC and ATAX Freestone Holdings, LLC, the Partnership makes investments in non-controlling limited membership interests in entities formed to construct market-rate multifamily properties. The Partnership applies the equity method of accounting by initially recording these investments at cost, subsequently adjusted for accrued preferred returns, the Partnership s share of earnings (losses) of the unconsolidated entities, cash contributions, and distributions. The Partnership reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Factors considered include: The absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment; 

 The inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment; or 

 Estimated sales proceeds that are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment. 

 The Partnership s assessment of whether a decline in value is other than temporary is based on the Partnership s ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment. The Partnership earns a preferred return on its investments in Vantage properties that is guaranteed by an unrelated third party, which is also an affiliate of the unconsolidated entities. The term of the third-party guaranty is from the initial investment through a date approximately five years after commencement of construction. The Partnership recognizes its preferred return based upon the guaranty provided by the unrelated third-party, the guarantor s financial ability to perform under the guaranty and the cash flows expected to be received from each property. Preferred returns are reported within Investment income on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. The Partnership earns a preferred return on its investments in Freestone properties that is senior to the preferred return and return of capital of the other members of the unconsolidated entities. The Partnership recognizes its preferred return on each investment to the extent there is capital of the managing member of the unconsolidated entity to support the recognition of preferred return. Preferred returns are reported within Investment income on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Partnership will recognize its share of earnings (losses) of the unconsolidated entities, when appropriate, and report within Earnings (losses) from investments in unconsolidated entities on the Partnership s cons olidated statements of operations. There are generally no earnings (losses) reported during the construction period for each unconsolidated entity as construction costs are capitalized. 

The Greens Hold Co is a corporation that is subject to federal and state income taxes. The Partnership recognizes income tax expense or benefit for the federal and state income taxes incurred by this entity in its consolidated financial statements. The Partnership evaluates its tax positions on the consolidated financial statements under the accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions. The Partnership may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Partnership believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities. The Partnership accrues interest and penalties, if any, and reports them within Income tax expense on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. Deferred income tax expense or benefit, is generally a function of the period s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes), such as depreciation, amortization of financing costs, etc. and the utilization of tax net operating losses NOLs ). The Partnership values its deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Partnership records a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if it believes all, or some portion, of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred income tax expense. 

As a result of the Reverse Unit Split, holders of BUCs received one BUC for every three BUCs owned at the close of business on April 1, 2022. All fractional BUCs created by the Reverse Unit Split were rounded to the nearest whole BUC, with any fraction equal to or above 0.5 BUC rounded up to the next higher BUC, as provided by the Partnership Agreement. Immediately prior to the Reverse Unit Split, there were BUCs issued and outstanding, and immediately after the Reverse Unit Split the number of issued and outstanding BUCs decreased to . In connection with the Reverse Unit Split, the CUSIP number for the BUCs changed to 02364V 206. The BUCs continue to trade on the NYSE under the trading symbol GHI. On September 14, 2022, the Partnership declared a supplemental distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to per BUC (the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution ). The Third Quarter BUCs Distribution was paid at a ratio of BUCs for each issued and outstanding BUC as of the record date of , which represents an amount per BUC based on the closing price of the BUCs on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on September 13, 2022, which was the national securities exchange upon which the BUCs were listed as of that date. The Third Quarter BUCs Distribution was completed on October 31, 2022. On December 19, 2022, the Partnership declared a supplemental distribution payable in the form of additional BUCs equal to per BUC (the Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution , collectively with the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution, the BUCs Distributions ). The Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution was paid at a ratio of BUCs for each issued and outstanding BUC as of the record date of , which represents an amount per BUC based on the closing price of the BUCs on the NYSE on December 16, 2022. The Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution was completed on January 31, 2023. There were no fractional BUCs issued in connection with the BUCs Distributions. All fractional BUCs resulting from the BUCs Distributions received cash for such fraction based on the market value of the BUCs on the record date. The one-for-three Reverse Unit Split and the BUCs Distributions have been applied retroactively to all net income per BUC, distributions per BUC and similar per BUC disclosures for all periods indicated in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 
 million BUCs, which reflects adjustments made to the number of BUCs that may be granted under the Plan as a result of the Reverse Unit Split. RUAs have historically been granted with vesting conditions ranging from three months to up to three years. RUAs typically provide for the payment of distributions during the restriction period. The RUAs provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, or upon death or disability of the participant. Outstanding RUAs were adjusted on a one-for-three basis in conjunction with the Reverse Unit Split effected on April 1, 2022. The number of outstanding RUAs was not impacted by the BUCs Distributions as holders of RUAs did not participate in the BUCs Distributions, but rather received cash in the amount of per RUA. The fair value of each RUA is estimated on the grant date based on the Partnership s exchange-listed closing price of the BUCs. The Partnership recognizes compensation expense for the RUAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period. The Partnership accounts for modifications to RUAs as they occur, if the fair value of the RUAs change, there are changes to vesting conditions or the awards no longer qualify for equity classificatio n. The Partnership accounts for forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability related to the ground lease. The discount rate is based on the Partnership s estimated incremental borrowing rate to borrow, on a fully collateralized basis, over a similar term for the amount of contractual lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate was estimated using market transactions adjusted for differences in term and security. 
 
 ROU asset has been recorded for such leases. Lease revenue is recognized monthly and is reported within Property revenues on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. 

to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class and to the General Partner. Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2) are allocated to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class and to the General Partner. Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2) in excess of the maximum allowable amount as set forth in the Partnership Agreement are considered Net Interest Income (Tier 3) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 3) and are allocated to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class. 

(1) All cash distributions per BUC amounts above have been retroactively adjusted for the one-for-three Reverse Unit Split and the BUCs Distributions. 

In addition to cash distributions, the General Partner declared two distributions to BUC holders in the form of additional BUCs during 2022 totaling per BUC. In October 2022, the Partnership completed the Third Quarter BUCs Distribution equal to per BUC and paid at a ratio of BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of September 30, 2022. In January 2023, the Partnership completed the Fourth Quarter BUCs Distribution equal to per BUC at a ratio of BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of December 30, 2022. The BUCs distributions were made pro rata among all BUC holders as of the record date, with BUC holders receiving cash for all resulting fractional BUCs. 

 dilutive BUCs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

 Non-Consolidated VIEs The Partnership has variable interests in various VIEs in the form of MRBs, taxable MRBs, GILs, taxable GILs, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities. These variable interests do not allow the Partnership to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of such VIEs. As a result, the Partnership is not considered the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate the financial statements of these VIEs in the consolidated financial statements. The Partnership held variable interests in and non-consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Partnership s maximum exposure to loss for the MRBs and taxable MRBs as of December 31, 2022 is equal to the Partnership s cost adjusted for paydowns. The difference between the MRB carrying value in the Partnership's consolidated balance sheets and the maximum exposure to loss is a function of the unrealized gains or losses. The Partnership has future MRB and taxable MRB funding commitments related to non-consolidated VIEs totaling million and million , respectively, as of December 31, 2022 (Note 18).

The reported unrealized loss includes the unrealized loss on the current MRB carrying value (based on current fair value) as well as the unrealized loss on the Partnership s remaining million funding commitment outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (also based on current fair value). The Partnership determined the unrealized loss is a result of increasing market interest rates and that the cumulative unrealized loss is not other-than-temporary.

The Partnership has committed to provide funding for certain MRBs on a draw-down basis during construction and/or rehabilitation of the secured properties as of December 31, 2022. See Note 18 for additional information regarding the Partnership s MRB funding commitments. See Note 23 for a description of the methodology and significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the MRBs. Unrealized gains or losses on the MRBs are recorded in the Partnership s consolidated statements of comprehensive income to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the MRBs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Partnership recognized a provision for credit loss of million related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in its consolidated statements of operations. The borrower of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2020 and ceased making contractual principal and interest payments. The credit loss was driven primarily by collateral information obtained during the bankruptcy process. The underlying property was successfully sold out of bankruptcy in July 2022 and final settlement of the bankruptcy estate is ongoing. The net carrying value of the MRB, inclusive of accrued interest, is million as of December 31, 2022, which is the estimate of the proceeds that will ultimately receive upon liquidation of the bankruptcy and bond trust estate. The Partnership received million of initial proceeds in January 2023 and expects the remaining proceeds to be received at final liquidation. Activity in 2022: Acquisitions:

 Restructurings: In January 2022, the Live 929 Apartments property completed a restructuring of the Partnership s MRBs and property loan. The Partnership s Live 929 Apartments 2014 Series A and Live 929 Apartments 2014 Series B MRBs were redeemed at par plus accrued interest. The following tables summarizes the terms of the MRBs upon redemption:

Upon restructuring, the Partnership used the proceeds of the redeemed MRBs plus additional cash to acquire a new series of MRB secured by the Live 929 Apartments property, the Series 2022A MRB. The following tables summarizes the MRB that was acquired as part of the restructuring of the Live 929 Apartments MRBs:

In addition, a portion of the Live 929 Apartments property loan was redeemed as part of the restructuring, with proceeds used to acquire the new Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB. The Partnership also acquired a taxable MRB which is reported in Other Assets (Note 12). The redemption of the prior Live 929 Apartments 2014 Series A and 2014 Series B MRBs and property loan and acquisition of the new Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring.

The Partnership recognized a provision for loan loss and associated loan loss allowance of approximately for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the Live 929 Apartments property loan as the Partnership determined it was probable the outstanding balance will not be collectible. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the interest to be earned on the Live 929 Apartments property loan was in nonaccrual status. The discounted cash flow method used by management to establish the net realizable value of the property loan determined the collection of the interest accrued was not probable. In addition, interest to be earned on the Cross Creek property loan and approximately of property loan principal for the Ohio Properties was in nonaccrual status for the year ended December 31, 2021 as, in management s opinion, the interest was not considered collectible. Activity in 2022 In January 2022, the Partnership received approximately million of principal and interest due on the Live 929 Apartments property loan upon restructuring of the outstanding debt of Live 929 Apartments.

In August 2022, the outstanding property loans due from Cross Creek were restructured and the Partnership advanced additional funds totaling approximately million. In September 2022, the underlying Cross Creek property was sold and the Partnership received million as redemption proceeds to satisfy all outstanding balances, which consisted of million of principal payments and approximately million of accrued interest. All property loan balances due from Cross Creek were previously on non-accrual status and fully reserved, so the Partnership recognized approximately million of other interest income upon redemption. In September 2022, the Magnolia Crossing property loan was repaid in full. The Partnership received proceeds of approximately million representing outstanding principal and accrued interest upon redemption. In December 2022, the Partnership provided a property loan to the SoLa Impact Opportunity Zone Fund in the amount of million to finance the completion of construction on a portfolio of affordable housing projects and commercial/mixed use project located in Los Angeles, California.

The property loan is unsecured, will be repaid from net cash flows of the property, and is subordinate to the mortgage debt of the property which was assumed by the buyer as described in Note 8. The property loan is in non-accrual status as of December 31, 2022 because payments under the loan are not required immediately and are expected to be paid from future net cash flows of the property as previously described in Note 8. Activity in 2021 Concurrent with the acquisition of GILs (Note 7), the Partnership committed to provide property loans for the construction of the underlying properties on a draw-down basis as summarized below.

The Partnership s income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based on the timing of the taxable income in the Greens Hold Co and the impact of deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period s temporary differences (i.e. depreciation, amortization of finance costs, etc.). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued based on enacted tax rates. The Greens Hold Co had net deferred tax assets of approximately and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Substantially all of the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to The 50/50 MF Property and will be realized along with the deferred gain on sale (Note 13). These amounts are reported within Other assets on the Partnership s consolidated balance sheets. The Partnership evaluated whether it is more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will be realizable and recorded valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, income taxes computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rates to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the Greens Hold Co differ from the provision for income taxes due to state income taxes (net of the effect on federal income tax). The Partnership accrues interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. There were material uncertain tax positions, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Partnership files U.S. federal and state tax returns.

The Partnership has entered into a secured Credit Agreement Secured Credit Agreement of up to million with BankUnited and Bankers Trust Company, and the sole lead arranger and administrative agent, BankUnited, for a general secured line of credit (the General LOC ). The aggregate available commitment cannot exceed a borrowing base calculation, that is equal to multiplied by the aggregate value of a pool of eligible encumbered assets. Eligible encumbered assets consist of (i) the net book value of the Suites on Paseo MF Property, and (ii) of the Partnership s capital contributions to certain equity investments, subject to certain restrictions. The proceeds of the General LOC will be used by the Partnership to purchase additional investments and to meet general working capital and liquidity requirements. The Partnership may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts at any time through the maturity date, subject to the limitations of the borrowing base. The General LOC is secured by first priority security interests in the Partnership s Vantage investments in unconsolidated entities, a mortgage and assignment of leases and rents of the Suites on Paseo MF Property, and a security interest in a bank account at BankUnited, in which the Partnership must maintain a balance of not less than million. In addition, an affiliate of the Partnership, Greystone Select Incorporated Greystone Select ), has provided a deficiency guaranty of the Partnership s obligations under the Secured Credit Agreement. Greystone Select is subject to certain covenants and was in compliance with such covenants as of December 31, 2022. No fees were paid to Greystone Select related to the deficiency guaranty agreement. million, maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million, and to notify BankUnited if the Partnership s consolidated net worth declines by (a) more than from the immediately preceding quarter, or (b) more than from the date at the end of two consecutive calendar quarters ending immediately thereafter. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Partnership and Bankers Trust Company have entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a secured non-operating line of credit (the Acquisition LOC with a maximum commitment of up to million. The Acquisition LOC may be used to fund purchases of multifamily real estate, tax-exempt or taxable MRBs, and tax-exempt or taxable loans issued to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of affordable housing or which are otherwise secured by real estate or mortgage-backed securities (collectively, the financed assets ). The financed assets acquired with the proceeds of the Acquisition LOC will be held in a custody account and the outstanding balances of the Acquisition LOC will be secured by a first priority interest in the financed assets and will be maintained in the custody account until released by Bankers Trust Company. , but in no event later than the maturity date by providing Bankers Trust Company with a written request for such extension together with a principal payment of of the principal amount of the original acquisition advance for the first such extension, for the second such extension, and for the third such extension. In July 2022, the Partnership executed an amendment to the credit agreement that extended the maturity date to June 2024; provided the Partnership two one-year extension options, subject to certain terms and conditions; removed certain restricted payment provisions; modified the covenant requiring senior debt to not exceed a specified percentage of the market value of the Partnership s assets to be consistent with the Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Partnership) and increased the threshold percentage; modified certain notification provisions regarding defaults under agreements with other creditors; added certain events of default that are consistent with the Partnership s other secured financing arrangements; and eliminated the Partnership s ability to finance purchases of existing or to-be-constructed multifamily property improvements under the credit agreement. In addition, certain interest rate terms were modified. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. Outstanding balances on the Acquisition LOC as of December 31, 2022 were repaid in January 2023.

The TOB, term TOB and TEBS financing arrangements are consolidated VIEs of the Partnership (Note 5). The Partnership is the primary beneficiary due to its rights to the underlying assets. Accordingly, the Partnership consolidates the TOB, term TOB and TEBS financings on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. See information regarding the MRBs, GILs, property loans, taxable MRBs and taxable GILs securitized within the TOB, term TOB and TEBS financings in Notes 6, 7, 10 and 12, respectively. As the residual interest holder in the arrangements, the Partnership may be required to make certain payments or contribute certain assets to the VIEs if certain events occur. Such events include, but are not limited to, a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities issued by the VIEs, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the VIEs, increases in short term interest rates beyond pre-set maximums, an inability to re-market the senior securities, or an inability to obtain liquidity for the senior securities. If such an event occurs in an individual VIE, the Partnership may be required to deleverage the VIE by repurchasing some or all of the senior securities. Otherwise, the underlying collateral will be sold and, if the proceeds are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities plus accrued interest and other trust expenses, the Partnership will be required to fund any such shortfall. If the Partnership does not fund the shortfall, the default and liquidation provisions will be invoked against the Partnership. The shortfall on each TEBS financing is limited to the Partnership s residual interest. The Partnership has never been, and does not expect in the future, to be required to reimburse the VIEs for any shortfall. The Partnership s variable rate debt financing arrangements include maximum interest rate provisions that prevent the debt service on the debt financings from exceeding the cash flows from the underlying securitized assets. Tax Exempt Bond Securitization TEBS Financings The Partnership, through four wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the TEBS Sponsors ), has sponsored four separate TEBS financings the M24 TEBS financing, the M31 TEBS financing, the M33 TEBS financing, and the M45 TEBS financing (collectively, the TEBS financings ). The TEBS financings are structured such that the Partnership transferred MRBs to Freddie Mac to be securitized into the TEBS financings. Freddie Mac then issued Class A and Class B Freddie Mac Multifamily Variable Rate Certificates or Class A and Class B Freddie Mac Multifamily Fixed Rate Certificates (collectively, the TEBS Certificates ), which represent beneficial interests in the securitized assets. The Class A TEBS Certificates are senior securities that are sold to unaffiliated investors and entitle the holders to cash flows from the securitized assets. The Class A TEBS Certificates are credit enhanced by Freddie Mac such that Freddie Mac will cover any shortfall if the cash flows from the securitized assets are less than the contractual principal and interest due to the Class A TEBS Certificate holders. The TEBS Sponsors or Partnership would then be required to reimburse Freddie Mac for any credit enhancement payments. The Class B TEBS Certificates are residual interests retained by the TEBS Sponsors and grant the Partnership rights to certain cash flows from the securitized assets after payment to the Class A Certificates and related facility fees, as well as certain other rights to the securitized assets. The TEBS financings are non-recourse financing to the Partnership and the maximum exposure to loss is the value of the Class B Certificates, before consideration of the Partnership s total return swap. The M31 TEBS financing includes maximum interest rate provisions that prevent the debt service from exceeding the cash flows from the underlying securitized assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership posted restricted cash as contractually required under the terms of the four TEBS financings. In addition, the Partnership has entered into an interest rate cap agreement to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable-rate M31 TEBS financing (Note 17). Secured Notes Financing Secured Notes ATAX TEBS Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, has issued Secured Notes to Mizuho with an initial aggregate principal amount of million. The Secured Notes are secured by the Partnership s residual certificates associated with its TEBS financings. The Secured Notes bear interest at a variable rate , payable monthly. Interest due on the Secured Notes will be paid from receipts related to the four TEBS financing residual certificates. Future receipts of principal related to the four TEBS financing residual certificates will be used to pay down the principal of the Secured Notes. The Partnership has guaranteed the payment and performance of the responsibilities of ATAX TEBS Holdings, LLC under the Secured Notes. If ATAX TEBS Holdings, LLC defaults on its obligations under the Secured Notes and the Partnership does not cure the default, the Partnership s four TEBS financing residual certificates and their related rights to the underlying TEBS assets will be assigned to Mizuho. If this occurs, the Partnership will cease to be the primary beneficiary of the TEBS financing VIEs and such VIEs will no longer be consolidated in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. Concurrent with the issuance of the Secured Notes, the Partnership entered into two total return swap transactions with Mizuho to reduce the net interest cost related to the Secured Notes (Note 17). The Secured Notes are non-recourse obligations of the Partnership, though there is recourse to the Partnership for any valuation shortfalls under the related total return swap. The total return swap is a position subject to the Partnership s overall net mark-to-market determination under the Mizuho ISDA master agreement discussed below. The restricted cash associated with the Secured Notes is collateral posted with Mizuho according to the terms of the total return swap that has the Secured Notes as the reference security (Note 17). TOB and Term TOB Trust Financings The Partnership has entered into various TOB trust financings with Mizuho and Barclays secured by various investment assets. The TOB trust structures under Mizuho and Barclays are functionally similar. Under these TOB trust financings, the trustee issues senior securities and residual interests that represent beneficial interests in the TOB trust that entitle the holders to cash flows from the securitized assets within the TOB trust. The senior securities are sold to unaffiliated investors and entitle the holder to cash flows from the securitized assets at a variable interest rate. The senior securities are credit enhanced by Mizuho or Barclays such that Mizuho or Barclays will cover any shortfall if the cash flows from the securitized assets are less than the contractual principal and interest due to the senior security holders. The Partnership will then be required to reimburse Mizuho or Barclays for any credit enhancement payments. The residual interests are retained by the Partnership and grant the Partnership rights to certain cash flows from the securitized assets after payment to the senior securities and related trust fees, as well as certain other rights to the securitized assets. The TOB trust financings are generally recourse obligations of the partnership under the respective ISDA master agreements discussed below. The TOB trust financings include maximum interest rate provisions that prevent the debt service on the debt financings from exceeding the cash flows from the underlying securitized assets. Mizuho Capital Markets The TOB trusts and Secured Notes with Mizuho are subject to an ISDA master agreement that contains certain covenants and requirements related to the Partnership s TOB trusts and Secured Notes. The TOB trusts require that Partnership s residual interests must maintain a certain value in relation to the total assets in each TOB trust. The ISDA master agreement with Mizuho requires the Partnership s partners capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold and that the Partnership remain listed on a national securities exchange. If the Partnership is not in compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered. The Partnership was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022.The Partnership is subject to mark-to-market collateral posting provision for positions under the ISDA master agreement with Mizuho. The amount of collateral posting required is dependent on the valuation of the securitized assets and interest rate swaps (Note 17) in relation to thresholds set by Mizuho at the initiation of each transaction. As of December 31, 2022, the Partnership had posted all required cash collateral totaling million related to the Secured Notes total return swap. Barclays Bank PLC The TOB trusts with Barclays are subject to an ISDA master agreement that contains certain covenants and requirements related to the Partnership s TOB trusts. The Partnership s residual interests in the TOB trusts must maintain a certain value in relation to the total assets in the TOB trust. The ISDA master agreement with Barclays requires the Partnership s partners capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold, limits on the Partnership s Leverage Ratio (as defined by the Partnership) and that the Partnership remained listed on a national securities exchange. If the Partnership is not in compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered. The Partnership was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022. The Partnership may also be required to post collateral, typically in cash, related to the TOB trusts with Barclays. The amount of collateral posting required is dependent on the valuation of the securitized assets in relation to thresholds set by Barclays at the initiation of each transaction. There was no requirement to post collateral for the TOB trusts as of December 31, 2022. Morgan Stanley Bank The Partnership has entered into a term TOB trust financing with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. Morgan Stanley secured by an MRB. Under the term TOB trust structure, the trustee issued Class A Certificates and Class B Certificates that represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the term TOB trust. Morgan Stanley has purchased the Class A Certificates that are senior securities, and the Partnership has retained the Class B Certificates that are residual interests in the Trust. The Class B Certificates grant the Partnership certain rights to the securitized asset. The term TOB trust with Morgan Stanley is subject to a Trust Agreement and other related agreements that contain covenants with which the Partnership or the underlying MRB are required to comply. The underlying property must maintain certain occupancy and debt service covenants. A termination event will occur if the Partnership s net assets, as defined, decrease by in one quarter or over one year. The covenants also require the Partnership s partners capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold and that the Partnership remains listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange. If the underlying property or the Partnership, as applicable, is out of compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2022. Contractual Maturities

The total return swap has the Partnership s Secured Notes with Mizuho as the specified reference security (Note 15), with the total return swap notional amount equal to the outstanding principal on the Secured Notes. The rate received on the total return swap is equal to the interest rate on the Secured Notes such that they offset one another, resulting in a net interest cost equal to the rate paid under the total return swap. Under the total return swap, the Partnership is liable for any decline in the value of the Secured Notes under the ISDA master agreement with Mizuho, when netted with the value of Partnership s other positions with Mizuho. The Partnership was required to initially fund cash collateral with Mizuho for each total return swap. The total return swap with a notional amount of million , requires the Partnership to maintain cash collateral equal to of the notional amount. The second total return swap, which was terminated in March 2022, required the Partnership to maintain cash collateral equal to of the notional amount. In March 2022, the Partnership allocated the notional amount of million from the second total return swap to the first total return swap which resulted in an increase in unrestricted cash of approximately million. In December 2022, the Partnership amended certain terms associated with the remaining total return swap, including an update in the variable rate index from 3-month LIBOR to SOFR. There were no fees associated with the amendment. Interest Rate Cap Agreement The Partnership has entered into an interest rate cap agreement to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt financing facilities.

The buyer assumed two mortgages payable associated with the property and the Partnership agreed to provide certain recourse support for the assumed mortgages. The TIF Loan support is in the form of a payment guaranty. The Mortgage support is in the form of a forward loan purchase agreement upon maturity of the Mortgage. The estimated fair value of the credit guaranties as of the commitment date totaled approximately and is included within other liabilities in the Partnership's consolidated financial statements. No additional contingent liability has been accrued because the likelihood of claims is remote. The following table summarizes the Partnership s maximum exposure under these credit guaranties as of December 31, 2022:

 million BUCs. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately restricted units and other awards available for future issuance. The number of BUCs with respect to which awards may be granted under the Plan, the number of BUCs subject to outstanding awards granted under the Plan, and the grant price with respect to any such awards were retroactively adjusted to account for the Reverse Unit Split on a one-for-three basis. RUAs have historically been granted with vesting conditions ranging from to up to . Unvested RUAs are typically entitled to receive distributions during the restriction period. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of the RUAs if there is a change in control related to the Partnership, the General Partner, or the general partner of the General Partner, or upon death or disability of the Plan participant. The fair value of each RUA is estimated on the grant date based on the Partnership s exchange-listed closing price of the BUCs. The Partnership recognizes compensation expense for the RUAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period. The compensation expense for RUAs totaled approximately million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Compensation expense is reported within General and administrative expenses on the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments The effect of the Partnership s interest rate swap agreements is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the agreement. The Partnership uses a third-party pricing service that incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The fair value is based on a model that considers observable indices and observable market trades for similar arrangements and therefore the interest rate swaps are categorized as Level 2 assets or liabilities. The effect of the Partnership s interest rate cap is to set a cap, or upper limit, subject to performance of the counterparty, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt financings equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement. The Partnership uses a third-party pricing service and the inputs in the interest rate cap agreements valuation model include three-month LIBOR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms. The fair value is based on a model with inputs that are not observable and therefore the interest rate cap is categorized as a Level 3 asset. The effect of the Partnership s total return swap is to lower the net interest rate related to the Partnership s Secured Notes equal to the notional amount of the derivative instruments. The Partnership uses a third-party pricing service and the inputs in the total return swap valuation model include changes in the value of the Secured Notes and the associated changes in value of the underlying assets securing the Secured Notes, accrued and unpaid interest, and any potential gain share amounts. The fair value is based on a model with inputs that are not observable and therefore the total return swaps are categorized as Level 3 assets or liabilities.

Total gains and losses included in earnings for the derivative instruments are reported within Interest expense in the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership utilized a third-party pricing service to determine the fair value of the Partnership s GILs, taxable GILs, and construction financing property loans that share a first mortgage lien with the GILs, which is an estimate of their market price. The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of the GILs and property loans as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, the progress of construction and operations of the underlying properties, and the financial capacity of guarantors. The valuation methodology also considers the probability that conditions for the execution of forward commitments to purchase the GILs will be met. Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s GILs, taxable GILs, and construction financing property loans are categorized as Level 3 assets. The estimated fair value of the GILs and taxable GILs was million and million as of December 31, 2022, respectively. The estimated fair value of the GILs and taxable GIL approximated amortized cost as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of the construction financing property loans approximated amortized cost as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership utilized a third-party pricing service to determine the fair value of the Partnership s financial liabilities, which are estimates of market prices. The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of each financial liability as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, legal structure, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying assets, and asset quality. The financial liability values are then estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis. The Partnership evaluates pricing data received from the third-party pricing service, including consideration of current market interest rates, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the underlying collateral, and other information from either the third-party pricing service or public sources. The fair value estimates of these financial liabilities are based largely on unobservable inputs believed to be used by market participants and require the use of judgment on the part of the third-party pricing service and the Partnership. Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s financial liabilities are categorized as Level 3 liabilities. The TEBS financings are credit enhanced by Freddie Mac. The TOB trust financings are credit enhanced by either Mizuho or Barclays.

 Item 11. Executiv e Compensation.

(1) This column reflects grants of restricted unit awards RUAs under the Amended and Restated Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The Plan permits the grant of RUAs and other awards to the employees of the general partner of the General Partner, the Partnership, or any affiliate of either, and to members of the Board for up to 1 million BUCs. RUAs are generally granted with vesting conditions ranging from three months to up to three years. RUAs granted to executive officers during 2022 and 2021 provide for the payment of distributions during the restriction period. The RUAs also provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control related to the Partnership, the General Partner, or the general partner of AFCA 2. The value of the RUAs to the named executive officers in the table above represents the aggregate grant date fair value of each award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The values were computed by multiplying the number of units underlying the unit award by the closing price of the Partnership s BUCs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (which was the national securities exchange upon which the BUCs were listed on the date of grant) on the grant date. The Partnership awarded the named executive officers a total of 40,380 RUAs on August 8, 2022 with a grant date fair value of 19.43 per unit. 

Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
 On June 24, 2015, the Board of Managers of the then current general partner of the Partnership s General Partner approved the America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which was subsequently approved by the Partnership s BUC holders on September 15, 2015. On December 5, 2022, the Board approved the Amended and Restated Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ), which made certain administrative updates and replaced the original plan in its entirety. These administrative updates did not require approval by the Partnership s BUC holders. 
 The purpose of the Plan is to promote the interests of the Partnership and its Unitholders by providing incentive compensation awards that encourage superior performance. The Plan is also intended to attract and retain the services of individuals who are essential 
 145 

for the Partnership s growth and profitability and to encourage those individuals to devote their best efforts to advancing the Partnership s business. 
 The maximum number of BUCs that may be delivered with respect to awards under the Plan is 1,000,000. The Plan is generally administered by the Board, or any compensation committee of the Board, if appointed, or any other committee as may be appointed by the Board to administer the Plan (the Board or any such committee is referred to herein as the Committee ). The Committee has the full authority, subject to the terms of the Plan, to establish, amend, suspend, or waive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan, to designate participants under the Plan, to determine the number of BUCs to be covered by awards, to determine the type or types of awards to be granted to a participant, and to determine the terms and conditions of any award. All employees of the general partner of AFCA 2 and members of the Board, and employees of affiliates of the general partner of AFCA 2, including the Partnership, that perform services for of the general partner of AFCA 2, the Partnership, or an affiliate of either are eligible to be selected to participate in the Plan. The selection of which eligible individuals will receive awards is within the sole discretion of the Committee. 
 The Plan provides that the Committee may grant any or all of the following types of awards to eligible participants: (i) unit options; (ii) unit appreciation rights; (iii) restricted units; (iv) phantom units; (v) unit awards; and (vi) other unit-based awards. The Committee has full authority, subject to the terms of the Plan, to determine the types and amount of awards granted and the participants eligible to receive awards. 
 Upon the occurrence of any distribution (whether in cash, units, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, units split, reorganization or liquidation, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, separation, combination, repurchase, acquisition of property or securities, or exchange of units or other securities of the Partnership, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase units or other securities of the Partnership, or other similar transaction or event affects the units, then the Committee will equitably adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of units (or other securities or property) with respect to which awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of units (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding awards, (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any award, (iv) any performance criteria for performance-based awards, except for awards based on continued service as an employee or manager, (v) the appropriate fair market value and other price determinations for such awards, and (vi) any other limitations in the Plan or, subject to Section 409A of the IRC, as amended, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding award. 
 The effective date of the Plan is June 24, 2015 (the Effective Date ). The term of the Plan will expire on the earlier of (i) the date it is terminated by the Board; (ii) the date units are no longer available under the plan for delivery pursuant to awards; or (iii) the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date (which is June 24, 2025). The Board may amend the Plan at any time; provided, however, that BUC holder approval will be obtained for any amendment to the Plan to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or securities exchange rule. The Committee may also amend any award agreement evidencing an award made under the Plan, provided that no change in any outstanding award may be made that would adversely affect the rights of the participant under any previously granted award without the consent of the affected participant. Repricing of unit options and unit appreciation rights is prohibited under the Plan without the approval of our BUC holders, except in the case of adjustments implemented to reflect certain Partnership transactions, as described above. 
 Restricted units granted under the Plan totaled 96,321 and 88,775 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Restricted units of 2,235 that were granted during 2022 were subsequently forfeited. No other types of awards have been granted under the Plan as of December 31, 2022. There are 478,155 BUCs available for future issuance under the Plan as of December 31, 2022.

Manager Compensation for 2022

 146 

with rules of the SEC and the NYSE related to public companies with securities listed on the NYSE in order for the Partnership and its BUCs to comply with the rules applicable to registrants that are limited partnerships.

 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 
 Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
 The general partner of the Partnership is AFCA 2 and the sole general partner of AFCA 2 is Greystone Manager. 
 The Greystone Manager Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving any related party transactions. The Greystone Manager Audit Committee reviews the material facts of all interested transactions. Interested transactions are those transactions, arrangements, or relationships in which (i) the aggregate amount involved exceeds a pre-established dollar threshold, (ii) the Partnership is a participant, and (iii) an executive officer or Manager of the Partnership, a greater than 5 beneficial owner of the Partnership s BUCs, an immediate family member of any of the foregoing, affiliates of the Partnership, entities for which the Partnership has an investment accounted for under the equity method, or trusts for the benefit of employees, has or will have an interest. In determining whether to approve or ratify an interested transaction, the Greystone Manager Audit Committee takes into account, among other factors, the benefits to the Partnership; whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person s interest in the transaction; whether the transaction is material to the Partnership; the approximate dollar value of the transaction as it relates to the related party; and the role the related party plays in arranging the transaction. The Partnership did not enter into any material financial transactions with any related party or immediate family member of a Manager or executive officer of the Partnership during 2022 and 2021, except as indicated below. If any such material financial transaction were contemplated, the terms of the transaction would be reviewed and approved by the Greystone Manager Audit Committee prior to the Partnership entering into such transaction. 
 For the identification of the members of the Board who are independent under the applicable SEC and NYSE requirements, see the disclosures in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this report on Form 10-K. 
 Transactions with Related Persons 
 Except as described in Note 22 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements filed in response to Item 8 of this report, the Partnership is not a party to any transaction or proposed transaction with AFCA 2, Greystone or with any person who is: (i) a manager or executive officer of Greystone or any general partner of AFCA 2; (ii) a nominee for election as a manager of Greystone Manager; (iii) an owner of more than five percent of the BUCs; or, (iv) a member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons. The disclosures set forth in Note 22 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements filed in response to Item 8 of this report are incorporated by reference herein. 
 Item 14. Principal Accou ntant Fees and Services. 
 The Greystone Manager Audit Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Partnership for 2022. 
 The Audit Committee regularly reviews and determines whether any non-audit services provided by PwC potentially affects its independence with respect to the Partnership. The Audit Committee s policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by PwC. Pre-approval is generally provided by the Audit Committee for up to one year, is detailed as to the particular service or category of services to be rendered and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve additional services or specific engagements on a case-by-case basis. Management provides annual updates to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of any services provided in accordance with this pre-approval, as well as the cumulative fees for all non-audit 
 148 

services incurred to date. During 2022, all services performed by PwC with respect to the Partnership were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with this policy.

 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS).

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of balance sheet that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 In preparing the balance sheet, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after February 23, 2023. 
 Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Balance Sheet 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheet as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the balance sheet. 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the balance sheet, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheet. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the balance sheet. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

158 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

 Cash Distributions 
 
 General 
 
 The Partnership Agreement provides that all Net Interest Income generated by the Partnership that is not contingent interest will be distributed 99 to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class and 1 to the General Partner. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner is entitled to 25 of Net Interest Income representing contingent interest up to a maximum amount equal to 0.9 per annum of the principal amount of all mortgage bonds held by the Partnership, as the case may be. 

Interest Income of the Partnership includes all cash receipts, except for (i) capital contributions, (ii) Residual Proceeds (defined below), or (iii) the proceeds of any loan or the refinancing of any loan. Net Interest Income of the Partnership means all Interest Income plus any amount released from the Partnership s reserves for distribution, less expenses and debt service payments and any amount deposited in reserve or used or held for the acquisition of additional investments. 
 
 The Partnership Agreement provides that Net Residual Proceeds (whether representing a return of principal or contingent interest) will be distributed 100 to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class, except that 25 of Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest will be distributed to the General Partner until it receives a maximum amount per annum (when combined with all distributions to it of Net Interest Income representing contingent interest during the year) equal to 0.9 of the principal amount of the Partnership s mortgage bonds. Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, Residual Proceeds means all amounts received by the Partnership upon the sale of any asset or from the repayment of principal of any bond. Net Residual Proceeds means, with respect to any distribution period, all Residual Proceeds received by the Partnership during such distribution period, plus any amounts released from reserves for distribution, less all expenses that are directly attributable to the sale of an asset, amounts used to discharge indebtedness, and any amount deposited in reserve or used or held for the acquisition of investments. Notwithstanding its authority to invest Residual Proceeds in additional investments, the General Partner does not intend to use this authority to acquire additional investments indefinitely without distributing Net Residual Proceeds to the limited partners and BUC holders. Rather, it is designed to afford the General Partner the ability to increase the income-generating investments of the Partnership in order to potentially increase the Net Interest Income from, and value of, the Partnership. 
 
 With respect to the cash available for distribution to the limited partners, and subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series of our Partnership securities ranking senior to such securities with respect to distribution rights, holders of Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units are each entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the General Partner out of funds legally available for the payment of distributions, non-cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 3.00 per annum of the 10.00 per unit purchase price of the Series A Preferred Units or Series A-1 Preferred Units, as applicable, payable quarterly, and holders of the Series B Preferred Units are entitled to receive, when, as, and if declared by the General Partner out of funds legally available for the payment of distributions, non-cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 3.40 per annum of the 10.00 per unit purchase price of the Series B Preferred Units, payable quarterly. With respect to the payment of distributions, our Units have the following rankings: (i) Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, which are on parity to each other, but which are senior to; (ii) the Series B Preferred Units, which, along with the Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, are senior to; (iii) our BUCs. 
 
 Distributions Upon Liquidation 
 
 Upon the dissolution of the Partnership, the proceeds from the liquidation of its assets will be first applied to the payment of the obligations and liabilities of the Partnership and the establishment of any reserves therefor as the General Partner determines to be necessary, and then distributed to the partners (including both the General Partner and limited partners) and BUC holders in proportion to, and to the extent of, their respective capital account balances, and then in the same manner as Net Residual Proceeds. With respect to the liquidation proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners, the holders of each series of existing Preferred Units are each entitled to a liquidation preference in an amount equal to 10.00 per preferred unit, as applicable, plus an amount equal to all distributions declared and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution. With respect to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution, or the winding-up of the Partnership s affairs, our Units have the following rankings: (i) Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, which are on parity to each other, but which are senior to; (ii) the Series B Preferred Units, which, along with the Series A Preferred Units and Series A-1 Preferred Units, are senior to; (iii) our BUCs. 
 
 Timing of Cash Distributions 
 
 The Partnership currently makes quarterly cash distributions to BUC holders. However, the Partnership Agreement allows the General Partner to elect to make cash distributions on a more or less frequent basis provided that distributions are made at least semiannually. Regardless of the distribution period selected by the General Partner, cash distributions to BUC holders must be made within 60 days of the end of each such period. 

Distributions declared on the Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units, and Series B Preferred Units are payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 Allocation of Income and Losses 
 
 Income and losses from operations will be allocated 99 to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class and 1 to the General Partner. Income arising from a sale or liquidation of the Partnership s assets will be first allocated to the General Partner in an amount equal to the Net Residual Proceeds or liquidation proceeds distributed to the General Partner from such transaction, and the balance will be allocated to the limited partners and BUC holders as a class. Losses from a sale of a property or from a liquidation of the Partnership will be allocated among the partners in the same manner as the Net Residual Proceeds or liquidation proceeds from such transaction are distributed. 
 
 Determination of Allocations to Unitholders 
 
 Income and losses will be allocated on a monthly basis to the Unitholders of record as of the last day of a month. If a Unitholder is recognized as the record holder of Units on such date, such Unitholder will be allocated all income and losses for such month. 
 
 Cash distributions will be made to the BUC holders of record as of the last day of each distribution period. If the Partnership recognizes a transfer prior to the end of a distribution period, the transferee will be deemed to be the holder for the entire distribution period and will receive the entire cash distribution for such period. Accordingly, if the General Partner selects a quarterly or semiannual distribution period, the transferor of BUCs during such a distribution period may be recognized as the record holder of the BUCs at the end of one or more months during such period and be allocated income or losses for such months but not be recognized as the record holder of the BUCs at the end of the period and, therefore, not be entitled to a cash distribution for such period. Distributions to the holders of Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units, and Series B Preferred Units are made quarterly in arrears on the 15 th day of the first month of each calendar quarter. 
 
 The General Partner retains the right to change the method by which income and losses of the Partnership will be allocated between buyers and sellers of Units during a distribution period based on consultation with tax counsel and accountants. However, no change may be made in the method of allocation of income or losses without written notice to the Unitholders at least 10 days prior to the proposed effectiveness of such change unless otherwise required by law. 
 
 Payments to the General Partner 
 
 Fees 
 
 In addition to its share of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds and reimbursement for expenses, the General Partner is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45 per annum of the principal amount of the MRBs, other investments, and taxable mortgage loans held by the Partnership. In general, the administrative fee is payable by the owners of the properties financed by the MRBs held by the Partnership, but is subordinate to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the bonds. The General Partner may seek to negotiate the payment of the administrative fee in connection with the acquisition of additional MRBs by the Partnership by the owner of the financed property or by another third party. However, the Partnership Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by a third party. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage bonds. 
 
 Reimbursement of Expenses 
 
 In addition to the cash distributions and fee payments to the General Partner described above, the Partnership will reimburse the General Partner or its affiliates on a monthly basis for the actual out-of-pocket costs of direct telephone and travel expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Partnership, direct out-of-pocket fees, expenses, and charges paid to third parties for rendering legal, auditing, accounting, bookkeeping, 

computer, printing, and public relations services, expenses of preparing and distributing reports to limited partners and BUC holders, an allocable portion of the salaries and fringe benefits of non-officer employees of the general partner of the General Partner, insurance premiums (including premiums for liability insurance that will cover the Partnership and the General Partner), the cost of compliance with all state and federal regulatory requirements and stock exchange listing fees and charges, and other payments to third parties for services rendered to the Partnership. The General Partner will also be reimbursed for any expenses it incurs acting as the partnership representative (or tax matters partner) for tax purposes for the Partnership. The Partnership will not reimburse the General Partner or its affiliates for the travel expenses of the president of the general partner of the General Partner or for any items of general overhead. The Partnership will not reimburse the General Partner or its general partner for any salaries or fringe benefits of any of the executive officers of the general partner of the General Partner. The annual report to Unitholders is required to itemize the amounts reimbursed to the General Partner and its affiliates. 
 
 Payments for Goods and Services 
 
 The Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner and its affiliates may provide goods and services to the Partnership. The provision of any goods and services by the General Partner or its affiliates to the Partnership must be part of their ordinary and ongoing business in which it or they have previously engaged, independent of the activities of the Partnership, and such goods and services shall be reasonable for and necessary to the Partnership, shall actually be furnished to the Partnership, and shall be provided at the lower of the actual cost of such goods or services or the competitive price charged for such goods or services for comparable goods and services by independent parties in the same geographic location. All goods and services provided by the General Partner or any affiliates must be rendered pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement or a written contract containing a clause allowing termination without penalty on 60 days notice to the General Partner by the vote of the majority in interest of the BUC holders. Any payment made to the General Partner or any affiliate for goods and services must be fully disclosed to all limited partners and BUC holders. The General Partner does not currently provide goods and services to the Partnership other than its services as General Partner. If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of an MRB, the General Partner or an affiliate may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, the Partnership will pay such party its fees for such services. Under the Partnership Agreement, such property management fees may not exceed the lesser of (i) the fees charged by unaffiliated property managers in the same geographic area, or (ii) 5 of the gross revenues of the managed property. 
 
 Liability of Partners and Unitholders 
 
 Under the Delaware LP Act and the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner will be liable to third parties for all general obligations of the Partnership to the extent not paid by the Partnership. However, the Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner has no liability to the Partnership for any act or omission reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred by the Partnership Agreement and in the best interest of the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement also provides that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner does not owe any fiduciary duties to the limited partners and BUC holders. Therefore, Unitholders may have a more limited right of action against the General Partner than they would have absent those limitations in the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership Agreement also provides for indemnification of the General Partner and its affiliates by the Partnership for certain liabilities that the General Partner and its affiliates may incur in connection with the business of the Partnership; provided that no indemnification will be available to the General Partner and/or its affiliates if there has been a final judgment entered by a court determining that the General Partner s and/or affiliate s conduct for which indemnification is requested constitutes fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. To the extent that the provisions of the Partnership Agreement include indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, such provisions are, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), against public policy and, therefore, unenforceable. 
 
 No Unitholder will be personally liable for the debts, liabilities, contracts, or any other obligations of the Partnership unless, in addition to the exercise of his, her, or its rights and powers as a Unitholder, the Unitholder takes part in the control of the business of the Partnership. It should be noted, however, that the Delaware LP Act prohibits a limited partnership from making a distribution that causes the liabilities of the limited partnership to exceed the fair value of its assets. Any limited partner who receives a distribution knowing that the distribution was 

made in violation of this provision of the Delaware LP Act is liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution. This provision of the Delaware LP Act likely applies to Unitholders. In any event, the Partnership Agreement provides that to the extent our initial limited partner is required to return any distributions or repay any amount by law or pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, each BUC holder who has received any portion of such distributions is required to repay his, her, or its proportionate share of such distribution to our initial limited partner immediately upon notice by the initial limited partner to such BUC holder. Furthermore, the Partnership Agreement allows the General Partner to withhold future distributions to BUC holders until the amount so withheld equals the amount required to be returned by the initial limited partner. Because BUCs are transferable, it is possible that distributions may be withheld from a BUC holder who did not receive the distribution required to be returned. 
 
 Voting Rights of Unitholders 
 
 The Partnership Agreement provides that the initial limited partner will vote its limited partnership interests as directed by the BUC holders. Accordingly, except as described below regarding a person or group owning 20 or more of any class of Partnership securities then outstanding, the BUC holders, by vote of a majority in interest of the outstanding BUCs, may: 
 
 (i) amend the Partnership Agreement (provided that the concurrence of the General Partner is required for any amendment that modifies the compensation or distributions to which the General Partner is entitled or that affects the duties of the General Partner); 

(ii) approve or disapprove the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Partnership s assets in a single transaction (provided that, the General Partner may sell the last property owned by the Partnership without such consent); 

(iii) dissolve the Partnership; 

(iv) elect a successor general partner; and 

(v) terminate an agreement under which the General Partner provides goods and services to the Partnership. 

In addition, subject to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement regarding removal of the General Partner (described below), the BUC holders holding at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding BUCs may remove the General Partner. 
 
 Each limited partner and BUC holder that has voting rights under the Partnership Agreement is entitled to cast one vote for each unit of limited partnership interest such person owns. However, if any person or group (other than the General Partner and its affiliates) acquires beneficial ownership of 20 or more of any class of Partnership securities (including BUCs), that person or group loses voting rights with respect to all of his, her, or its securities and such securities will not be considered outstanding for voting or notice purposes, except as required by law. This loss of voting rights will not apply to any person or group that acquires the Partnership securities from the General Partner or its affiliates and any transferees of that person or group approved by the General Partner, or to any person or group who acquires the securities with the prior approval of the board of managers of the general partner of the General Partner. 
 
 The holders of the existing Preferred Units have no voting rights under the Partnership Agreement, except with respect to any amendment to the Partnership Agreement that would have a material adverse effect on the existing terms of the applicable series of Preferred Units and with respect to the creation or issuance of any Partnership securities that are senior to any such existing Preferred Units. Other than as set forth above, the holders of the existing Preferred Units have no voting rights under the Partnership Agreement on any matter that may come before the BUC holders for a vote. The approval of any of the matters for which the Preferred Units have voting rights requires the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding applicable series of Preferred Units. For any matter described in this paragraph for which the Preferred Unitholders are entitled to vote, such holders are entitled to one vote for each such Preferred Unit held. 

The General Partner may at any time call a meeting of the limited partners and BUC holders, call for a vote without a meeting of the limited partners and BUC holders, or otherwise solicit the consent of the limited partners and BUC holders, and is required to call such a meeting or vote or solicit consents following receipt of a written request therefor signed by 10 or more in interest of the outstanding limited partnership interests. The Partnership does not intend to hold annual or other periodic meetings of any of the Partnership s Unitholders. 
 
 Reports 
 
 Within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year, the General Partner will distribute a report to Unitholders that shall include (i) financial statements of the Partnership for such year that have been audited by the Partnership s independent public accountant, (ii) a report of the activities of the Partnership during such year, and (iii) a statement (which need not be audited) showing distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds. The annual report will also include a detailed statement of the amounts of fees and expense reimbursements paid to the General Partner and its affiliates by the Partnership during the fiscal year. 
 
 Within 60 days after the end of the first three quarters of each fiscal year, the General Partner will distribute a report that shall include (i) unaudited financial statements of the Partnership for such quarter, (ii) a report of the activities of the Partnership during such quarter, and (iii) a statement showing distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds during such quarter. With respect to both the annual and quarterly reports described above, the filing of the Partnership s annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q with the SEC are deemed to satisfy the foregoing report delivery obligations. 
 
 The Partnership will also provide Unitholders with a report on Form K-1 or other information required for federal and state income tax purposes within 75 days of the end of each year. 
 
 Withdrawal or Removal of the General Partner 
 
 The General Partner may not withdraw voluntarily from the Partnership or sell, transfer, or assign all or any portion of its interest in the Partnership unless a substitute general partner has been admitted in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. With the consent of a majority in interest of the BUC holders, the General Partner may at any time designate one or more persons as additional general partners, provided that the interests of the limited partners and BUC holders in the Partnership are not reduced thereby. The designation must meet the conditions set out in the Partnership Agreement and comply with the provisions of the Delaware LP Act with respect to admission of an additional general partner. In addition to the requirement that the admission of a person as successor or additional general partner have the consent of the majority in interest of the BUC holders, the Partnership Agreement requires, among other things, that (i) such person agree to and execute the Partnership Agreement, and (ii) counsel for the Partnership or the General Partner (or any of the General Partner s affiliates) renders an opinion that such person s admission would not result in the loss of limited liability of any limited partner or BUC holder or cause the Partnership or any of its affiliates to be taxed as a corporation or other entity under U.S. federal tax law. 
 
 With respect to the removal of the General Partner, the Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may not be removed unless that removal is approved by a vote of the holders of not less than 66 2/3 of the outstanding BUCs, including BUCs held by the General Partner and its affiliates, voting together as a single class, and the Partnership receives an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters. Any removal of the General Partner also will be subject to the approval of a successor general partner by the vote of a majority in interest of the outstanding BUCs voting as a single class. 
 
 In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that, under circumstances where the General Partner withdraws without violating the Partnership Agreement or is removed by the BUC holders without cause, the departing General Partner will have the option to require the successor general partner to purchase the general partner interest of the departing General Partner and its general partner distribution rights for their fair market value. This fair market value will be determined by agreement between the departing General Partner and the successor general partner. If no such agreement is reached, an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the departing General Partner and successor general partner will determine the fair market value. 

If the departing General Partner and successor general partner cannot agree upon an expert, then an expert chosen by agreement of the experts selected by each of them will determine the fair market value. If the option described above is not exercised, the departing General Partner s interest and general partner distribution rights will automatically convert into BUCs equal to the fair market value of those interests as determined by an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected in the manner described above. 
 
 The Partnership Agreement also provides that if the General Partner is removed as the Partnership s general partner under circumstances where cause does not exist and the BUCs held by the General Partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal, the General Partner will have the right to convert its general partner interest and its general partner distribution rights under the Partnership Agreement into BUCs or receive cash in exchange for those interests from the Partnership. 
 
 Effect of Removal, Bankruptcy, Dissolution, or Withdrawal of the General Partner 
 
 In the event of a removal, bankruptcy, dissolution, or withdrawal of the General Partner, it will cease to be the General Partner but will remain liable for obligations arising prior to the time it ceases to act in that role. The former General Partner s interest in the Partnership will be converted into a limited partner interest having the same rights to share in the allocations of income and losses of the Partnership and distributions of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and cash distributions upon liquidation of the Partnership as it did as General Partner. Any successor general partner shall have the option, but not the obligation, to acquire all or a portion of the interest of the removed General Partner at its then fair market value. The Partnership Agreement bases the fair market value of the General Partner s interest on the present value of its future administrative fees and distributions of Net Interest Income plus any amount that would be paid to the removed General Partner upon an immediate liquidation of the Partnership. Any disputes over valuation in connection with an option exercised by the successor general partner would be settled by the successor general partner and removed General Partner through arbitration. 
 
 Amendments 
 
 Amendments to the Partnership Agreement may be proposed by the General Partner or by the limited partners holding 10 or more of the outstanding limited partnership interests. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the amendments discussed below which may be approved solely by the General Partner, the General Partner must seek approval of the holders of the required number of BUCs to approve the amendment, whether by written consent or pursuant to a meeting of the BUC holders to consider and vote upon the proposed amendment. 
 
 In addition to amendments to the Partnership Agreement adopted by the BUC holders, the Partnership Agreement may be amended by the General Partner, without the consent of the Unitholders, in certain respects if such amendments are not materially adverse to the interest of the Unitholders, to reflect the following: 
 
 to change the name of the Partnership, the location of its principal place of business, its registered agent, or its registered office; 

to add to the representations, duties, or obligations of the General Partner or surrender any right or power granted to the General Partner in the Partnership Agreement; 

to change the fiscal year or taxable year of the Partnership and any other changes the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate as a result of a change in the fiscal year or taxable year; 

to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any provision of the Partnership Agreement which may be inconsistent with the intent of the Partnership Agreement, if such amendment is not materially adverse to the interests of the limited partners and BUC holders in the sole judgment of the General Partner; 

to amend any provision the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any judicial authority or any order, directive, or requirement contained in any federal or state statute, or to 

facilitate the trading of BUCs or comply with the rules of any national securities exchange on which the BUCs are traded; 

to amend any provision the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate to ensure the Partnership will be treated as a partnership, and that each BUC holder and limited partner will be treated as a limited partner, for federal income tax purposes; 

to reflect the withdrawal, removal, or admission of partners; 

to provide for any amendment necessary, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, to prevent the Partnership, the General Partner, or their managers, directors, officers, trustees, or agents from being subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the plan asset regulations under ERISA; 

to effectuate any amendment to the Partnership Agreement or the Partnership s certificate of limited partnership that the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the authorization of the issuance of any class or series of Partnership securities; and 

any other amendments substantially similar to any of the foregoing. 

However, notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to the Partnership Agreement that (i) would have a material adverse effect on the existing terms of the Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units, or Series B Preferred Units, or (ii) creates Partnership securities senior to any of the Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units, or Series B Preferred Units, must be approved by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units, Series A-1 Preferred Units, or Series B Preferred Units, as applicable, voting as a separate class. 
 
 Dissolution and Liquidation 
 
 The Partnership will continue in existence until dissolved under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership will dissolve upon: 
 
 (i) the passage of 90 days following the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of a general partner who is at that time the sole general partner, unless all of the remaining partners entitled to vote (it being understood that for purposes of this provision the initial limited partner shall vote as directed by a majority in interest of the BUC holders) agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and a successor general partner is designated within such 90-day period; 

(ii) the election by a majority in interest of the BUC holders or by the General Partner (subject to the consent of a majority in interest of the BUC holders) to dissolve the Partnership; or 

(iii) any other event causing the dissolution of the Partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, its assets will be liquidated and after the payment of its obligations and the setting up of any reserves for contingencies that the General Partner considers necessary, any proceeds from the liquidation will be distributed as set forth under Distributions Upon Liquidation above; provided, however, that if deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the General Partner, in furtherance of the liquidation and distribution of the Partnership s assets, as a final liquidating distribution or from time to time, the General Partner may transfer to one or more liquidating trustees for the benefit of the Unitholders under a liquidating trust any assets of the Partnership not disposed of at the time of dissolution. 
 
 Designation of Partnership Representative 

The General Partner has been designated as the Partnership s tax matters partner and partnership representative for purposes of federal income tax audits pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. Each Unitholder agrees to execute any documents that may be necessary or appropriate to maintain such designation. 
 
 Tax Elections 
 
 Under the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has the exclusive authority to make or revoke any tax elections on behalf of the Partnership. 
 
 Books and Records 
 
 The books and records of the Partnership shall be maintained at the office of the Partnership located at 14301 FNB Parkway, Suite 211, Omaha, Nebraska 68154, and shall be available there during ordinary business hours for examination and copying by any Unitholder or the Unitholder s duly authorized representative. The records of the Partnership will include, among other records, a list of the names and addresses of all Unitholders, and Unitholders will have the right to secure, upon written request to the General Partner and payment of reasonable expenses in connection therewith, a list of the names and addresses of, and the number of Units held by, all Unitholders. 
 
 Accounting Matters 
 
 The fiscal year of the Partnership is the calendar year. The books and records of the Partnership shall be maintained on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Other Activities 
 
 The Partnership Agreement allows the General Partner and its affiliates to engage generally in other business ventures and provides that limited partners and BUC holders will have no rights with respect thereto by virtue of the Partnership Agreement. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that an affiliate of the General Partner may acquire and hold debt securities or other interests secured by a property that also secures an MRB held by the Partnership, provided that such MRB is not junior or subordinate to the interest held by such affiliate. 
 
 Derivative Actions 
 
 The Partnership Agreement provides that a BUC holder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the Partnership to recover a judgment to the same extent as a limited partner has such rights under the Delaware LP Act. The Delaware LP Act provides for the right to bring a derivative action, although it authorizes only a partner of a partnership to bring such an action. There is no specific judicial or statutory authority governing the question of whether an assignee of a partner (such as a BUC holder) has the right to bring a derivative action where a specific provision exists in the Partnership Agreement granting such rights. Furthermore, there is no express statutory authority for a limited partner s class action in Delaware, and whether a class action may be brought by Unitholders to recover damages for breach of the General Partner s duties in Delaware state courts is unclear. 
 
 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 This section is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of BUCs held by persons who are individual citizens or residents of the United States. This section is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the IRC ), existing and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the IRC (the Treasury Regulations ), and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change. Later changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below. The tax consequences to a BUC holder of an investment in our BUCs will depend in part on the BUC holder s own tax circumstances. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to us or we are references to Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP and our consolidated subsidiaries. 

The following discussion does not comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting us or our Unitholders and does not describe the application of the alternative minimum tax that may be applicable to certain Unitholders. Moreover, the discussion focuses on BUC holders who are individual citizens or residents of the United States and has only limited application to corporations, estates, entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, trusts, nonresident aliens, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States or other BUC holders subject to specialized tax treatment, such as banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, tax-exempt institutions, foreign persons (including, without limitation, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies and foreign persons eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with the United States), individual retirement accounts (IRAs), real estate investment trusts (REITs) or mutual funds, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons holding their BUCs as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other risk reduction transaction, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to our BUCs being taken into account in an applicable financial statement and persons deemed to sell their BUCs under the constructive sale provisions of the IRC. In addition, the discussion only comments, to a limited extent, on state, local, and foreign tax consequences, and does not address the Medicare 3.8 net investment income tax. Accordingly, we encourage each prospective holder of BUCs to consult his, her, or its own tax advisor in analyzing the state, local, and foreign tax consequences particular to such holder of the ownership or disposition of BUCs and potential changes in applicable laws. 
 
 The Partnership is unable to conclude or opine that interest on any MRB held by the Partnership is currently excludable from gross income of a bondholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts necessary to provide such a conclusion are unknown and not reasonably available to the Partnership or counsel, such facts cannot be obtained by the Partnership or counsel without unreasonable effort or expense, and because such facts rest peculiarly within the knowledge of other persons not affiliated with the Partnership. Specifically, such conclusion would require detailed information and calculations from the respective issuer, borrower, bond trustee, and guarantors of each MRB regarding eligibility under and compliance with the applicable provisions of the IRC and Treasury Regulations, including without limitation, information and computations relating to the investment of bond proceeds, use of bond proceeds, occupancy of bond-financed properties and rebate payments to the United States. Both the Partnership and its counsel have determined it is not possible to obtain this information and computations for all MRBs. 
 
 No ruling on the U.S. federal, state, or local tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the BUCs, or the statements or conclusions in this description, has been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service IRS or from any other tax authority, and a taxing authority, including the IRS, may not agree with the statements and conclusions expressed herein. Based upon the IRC, the Treasury Regulations, published revenue rulings and court decisions, and the facts described below, we expect the Partnership will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, no assurance can be given that any such conclusion or an opinion of counsel to that effect would be accepted by the IRS or, if challenged by the IRS, sustained in court. Any contest of this sort with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our BUCs, including the prices at which our BUCs trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS, principally legal, accounting, and related fees, will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our Unitholders and our General Partner and thus will be borne indirectly by our Unitholders and our General Partner. Furthermore, the 
 tax treatment of us, or of an investment in us, may be significantly modified by future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions. Any modifications may or may not be retroactively applied. 
 
 In reaching the conclusion set forth in the preceding paragraph, we note that the Partnership has not elected to be, will not elect to be, and is not otherwise treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and, for each taxable year, we believe that more than 90 of our gross income has been and will be income of the type that is qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the IRC. 
 
 We urge you to consult your own tax advisors about the specific tax consequences to you of purchasing, holding, and disposing of our BUCs, including the application and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws. 
 
 Taxation of the Partnership 

Partnership Status 
 
 An entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will not be liable for entity-level U.S. federal income taxes. Instead, as described below, each partner of the partnership (and in our case, our BUC holders) will take into account its respective share of the items of income, gain, loss, and deduction of the partnership in computing its U.S. federal income tax liability as if the partner (and in our case, the BUC holder) had earned such income directly, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to him, her, or it by the partnership. Distributions by a partnership to a partner generally are not taxable to the partnership or the partner unless the amount of cash distributed to him, her, or it is in excess of the partner s adjusted basis in his, her, or its partnership interest. Please read Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction and Treatment of Distributions on BUCs below. 
 
 Section 7704 of the IRC generally provides that publicly traded partnerships will be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, if 90 or more of a partnership s gross income for every taxable year it is publicly traded consists of qualifying income, the partnership may continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the Qualifying Income Exception ). Qualifying income includes income and gains derived from the exploration, development, mining or production, processing, transportation, and marketing of certain natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas and products thereof, as well as other types of income such as interest (other than from a financial business) and dividends. We estimate that less than 2 of our current gross income is not qualifying income; however, this estimate could change from time to time. 
 
 No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS and the IRS has made no determination as to our status or the status of our operating subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes or whether our operations generate qualifying income under Section 7704 of the IRC. 
 
 If we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, other than a failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery (in which case the IRS may also require us to make adjustments with respect to our Unitholders or pay other amounts), we will be treated as transferring all of our assets, subject to liabilities, to a newly formed corporation on the first day of the year in which we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception in return for stock in that corporation, and then as distributing that stock to our Unitholders in liquidation. This deemed contribution and liquidation should not result in the recognition of taxable income by our Unitholders or us so long as our liabilities do not exceed the tax basis of our assets and other conditions are met. Thereafter, we would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our BUCs may be modified by administrative or legislative action or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, and which may affect a BUC holder s investment. 
 
 At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, or other forms of taxation. Imposition of a similar tax on us in the jurisdictions in which we operate or in other jurisdictions to which we may expand could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our Unitholders. 
 
 If for any reason we are taxable as a corporation in any taxable year, our items of income, gain, loss and deduction would be taken into account by us in determining the amount of our liability for U.S. federal income tax, rather than being passed through to our Unitholders. Our taxation as a corporation would materially reduce the cash available for distribution to Unitholders and thus would likely substantially reduce the value of our BUCs. Any distribution made to a BUC holder at a time we are treated as a corporation would be (i) a taxable dividend to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, then (ii) a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the BUC holder s tax basis in its BUCs, and thereafter (iii) taxable capital gain.

 We will treat BUC holders as partners in the Partnership and distributions paid to BUC holders as being made to such holders in their capacity as partners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Also, BUC holders whose BUCs are held in street name or by a nominee and who have the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the ownership of their BUCs will be treated as partners of the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 A beneficial owner of BUCs whose BUCs have been transferred to a short seller to complete a short sale would appear to lose such owner s status as a partner with respect to those BUCs for federal income tax purposes. See below under Treatment of Securities Loans . 
 
 Income, gains, deductions, or losses, would not appear to be reportable by a BUC holder who is not a partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and any cash distributions received by a BUC holder who is not a partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes would therefore appear to be fully taxable as ordinary income. 
 
 For a discussion related to the risks of losing partner status as a result of securities loans, please read Tax Consequences of BUCs Ownership Treatment of Securities Loans. BUC holders who are not treated as partners of the Partnership as described above or who may be at risk of such treatment are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to them under their particular circumstances. 
 
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that BUC holders are treated as partners in the Partnership and that distributions to BUC holders will be made to such holders in their capacity as partners. 
 
 Flow-Through of Taxable Income 
 
 Subject to the discussion below under Entity-Level Collections of BUC Holder Taxes with respect to payments we may be required to make on behalf of our BUC holders, we do not pay any U.S. federal income tax. Rather, each holder will be required to report on his, her, or its U.S. federal income tax return each year the income, gains, losses and deductions allocated to such holder for our taxable year or years ending with or within its taxable year. Consequently, we may allocate income to a BUC holder even if that BUC holder has not received a cash distribution (with which it otherwise may use to pay the associated tax) 
 
 We will treat distributions that are declared to BUC holders as distributions by the Partnership to the BUC holders in connection with their interests in the Partnership. 
 
 Basis of Units 
 
 A BUC holder s tax basis in its BUCs initially will be the amount paid for those BUCs. A BUC holder s basis will be increased by the holder s initial allocable share of our liabilities. A BUC holder s basis will be (i) increased by the BUC holder s share of our income and any increases in such holder s share of our liabilities, and (ii) decreased, but not below zero, by the amount of all distributions to the BUC holder, the BUC holder s share of our losses, any decreases in the BUC holder s share of our liabilities, and certain other items. 
 
 The IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all of those interests. If you own BUCs and Preferred Units, please consult your tax advisor with respect to determining the consequences on your basis in your units. 
 
 Treatment of Distributions on BUCs 
 
 Distributions by us to a BUC holder generally will not be taxable to the BUC holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent the amount of any such cash distribution exceeds the holder s tax basis in his, her, or its BUCs immediately before the distribution. Our cash distributions in excess of a BUC holder s tax basis generally will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of the units, taxable in accordance with the 

rules described under Disposition of BUCs . Any reduction in a BUC holder s share of our liabilities for which no partner, including the General Partner, bears the economic risk of loss, known as nonrecourse liabilities, will be treated as a distribution by us of cash to that BUC holder. To the extent our distributions cause a BUC holder s at-risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year, the holder must recapture any losses deducted in previous years. See below Limitations on Deductibility of Losses . 
 A non-pro rata distribution of money or property may result in ordinary income to a BUC holder, regardless of the holder s tax basis in his, her, or its BUCs, if the distribution reduces the holder s share of our unrealized receivables, including depreciation recapture and/or substantially appreciated inventory items, each as defined in the IRC, and collectively, Section 751 Assets. Please see Disposition of BUCs Recognition of Gain or Loss for more discussion of Section 751 Assets. 
 
 Limitations on Deductibility of Losses 
 
 A BUC holder may not be entitled to deduct the full amount of loss we allocate to him, her, or it because its share of our losses will be limited to the lesser of (i) the BUC holder s adjusted tax basis in its BUCs, and (ii) in the case of a BUC holder that is an individual, estate, trust or certain types of closely-held corporations, the amount for which the holder is considered to be at risk with respect to our activities. A BUC holder will be at risk to the extent of its adjusted tax basis in its BUCs, reduced by (1) any portion of that basis attributable to the BUC holder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, (2) any portion of that basis representing amounts otherwise protected against loss because of a guarantee, stop loss agreement, or similar arrangement, and (3) any amount of money the BUC holder borrows to acquire or hold its BUCs, if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us, is related to another BUC holder, or can look only to the BUCs for repayment. 
 
 A BUC holder subject to the at risk limitation must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions (including distributions deemed to result from a reduction in a BUC holder s share of nonrecourse liabilities) cause the BUC holder s at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year. Losses disallowed to a BUC holder or recaptured as a result of the basis or at risk limitations will carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction in a later year to the extent that the BUC holder s adjusted tax basis or at risk amount, whichever is the limiting factor, is subsequently increased. Upon a taxable disposition of BUCs, any gain recognized by a BUC holder can be offset by losses that were previously suspended by the at risk limitation but not losses suspended by the basis limitation. Any loss previously suspended by the at-risk limitation in excess of that gain can no longer be used and will not be available to offset a BUC holder s salary or active business income. 
 
 In addition to the basis and at risk limitations, a passive activity loss limitation limits the deductibility of losses incurred by individuals, estates, trusts, some closely held corporations and personal service corporations from passive activities (such as, trade or business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate). The passive loss limitations are applied separately with respect to each publicly traded partnership. Consequently, any passive losses we generate will be available to offset only passive income generated by us. Passive losses that exceed a BUC holder s share of the passive income we generate may be deducted in full when a BUC holder disposes of all of its BUCs in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. The passive activity loss rules are applied after other applicable limitations on deductions, including the at risk and basis limitations. 
 
 For taxpayers other than corporations in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 (as revised by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, of 2020), and before January 1, 2026, an excess business loss limitation further limits the deductibility of losses by such taxpayers. An excess business loss is the excess (if any) of a taxpayer s aggregate deductions for the taxable year that are attributable to the trades or businesses of such taxpayer (determined without regard to the excess business loss limitation) over the aggregate gross income or gain of such taxpayer for the taxable year that is attributable to such trades or businesses plus a threshold amount. The threshold amount is equal to 250,000 or 500,000 for taxpayers filing a joint return. Disallowed excess business losses are treated as a net operating loss carryover to the following tax year. Any losses we generate that are allocated to a BUC holder and not otherwise limited by the basis, at risk, or passive loss limitations will be included in the determination of such BUC holder s aggregate trade or business deductions. Consequently, any losses we generate that are not otherwise limited will only be available to offset a BUC holder s other trade or business income plus an amount of non-trade or business income equal to the applicable threshold amount. Thus, except to the extent of the threshold amount, our losses that are not otherwise limited may not offset a 

BUC holder s non-trade or business income (such as salaries, fees, interest, dividends and capital gains). This excess business loss limitation will be applied after the passive activity loss limitation. 

Limitations on Interest Deductions 
 
 Commencing with taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 restricts the amount of interest expense that may be deducted. Generally, business interest expenses are now deductible only to the extent of business interest income plus 30 of adjusted taxable income. Any disallowed amount may be carried forward indefinitely. 
 
 Business interest is interest paid or accrued with respect to indebtedness allocable to a trade or business. It does not include investment interest expense. The 30 limit applies to adjusted taxable income. For the first four years of this new limitation, a person s adjusted taxable income means taxable income from trade or business activities, computed before any deductions for interest, depreciation, amortization, net operating losses and the new pass-through deduction. However, in the case of taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, depreciation and amortization deductions are not added back to income. As a result, there now is a lower limit on the amount of interest that may be deducted. The Partnership does not expect to have a trade or business that would cause interest allocated to BUC holders to be treated as business interest. 
 
 The deductibility of a non-corporate taxpayer s investment interest expense generally is limited to the amount of that taxpayer s net investment income. Investment interest expense includes interest on indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment, our interest expense attributed to portfolio income, and the portion of interest expense incurred to purchase or carry an interest in a passive activity to the extent attributable to portfolio income. 
 
 The computation of a BUC holder s investment interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other loan incurred to purchase or carry a BUC. Net investment income includes gross income from property held for investment and amounts treated as portfolio income under the passive loss rules, less deductible expenses, other than interest, directly connected with the production of investment income, but generally does not include gains attributable to the disposition of property held for investment or (if applicable) qualified dividend income. The IRS has indicated that the net passive income earned by a publicly traded partnership will be treated as investment income to its unitholders. In addition, the unitholder s share of our portfolio income will be treated as investment income. 
 
 BUC holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the interest expense limitation rules. 
 
 Entity-Level Collections of BUC Holder Taxes 
 
 If we are required or elect under applicable law to pay any U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax on behalf of any current or former BUC holder, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution of cash to the relevant BUC holder. Where the tax is payable on behalf of all BUC holders or we cannot determine the specific BUC holder on whose behalf the tax is payable, we are authorized to treat the payment as a distribution to all current BUC holders. We are authorized to amend our partnership agreement in the manner necessary to maintain uniformity of intrinsic tax characteristics of BUCs and to adjust later distributions, so that after giving effect to these distributions, the priority and characterization of distributions otherwise applicable under our partnership agreement is maintained as nearly as is practicable. Payments by us as described above could give rise to an overpayment of tax on behalf of a BUC holder, in which event the BUC holder may be entitled to claim a refund of the overpayment amount. BUC holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine the consequences to them of any tax payment we make on their behalf. 
 
 Limitation on Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions 

For any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer is prohibited from taking itemized deductions for miscellaneous expenses, or miscellaneous itemized deductions. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, these expenses (i) will be deductible by a non-corporate BUC holder for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent that the holder s share of such expenses, when combined with other miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceeds 2 of its adjusted gross income for the particular year, (ii) will not be deductible by a non-corporate BUC holder for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax purposes and (iii) will be subject to certain other limitations on deductibility. These limitations would apply to non-corporate BUC holders if the proposed activities of the Partnership do not constitute a trade or business. There is a risk that the IRS may contend, in any taxable year, that each non-corporate BUC holder s share of each of the Partnership s otherwise deductible expenses constitutes a miscellaneous expense, potentially subject to disallowance through taxable years ending before January 1, 2026 and the two percent (2 floor thereafter. We believe that the proposed activities of the Partnership will constitute a trade or business, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position on audit. 
 
 Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction 
 
 In preparing the Partnership s tax returns, and in determining the BUC holders allocable share of the Partnership s items of income, gain, loss and deduction, the Partnership will utilize various accounting and reporting conventions, some of which are discussed herein. There is no assurance that the use of such conventions will produce a result that conforms to the requirements of the IRC, Treasury Regulations, or IRS administrative pronouncements, and there is no assurance that the IRS will not successfully challenge the Partnership s use of such conventions. 
 
 The Partnership generally allocates each item of its income, gain, loss or deduction among the General Partner and Unitholders in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the Partnership. However, the Partnership will make certain special allocations in connection with the issuance of new BUCs in accordance with the principles of Section 704(c) of the IRC. Upon the issuance of additional BUCs, the Partnership expects that it will restate the book capital accounts of the existing BUC holders under applicable Treasury Regulations in order to reflect the fair market value of the Partnership s assets at the time additional BUCs are issued. This restatement of the existing BUC holders book capital accounts measures any gain or loss inherent in Partnership assets at the time new BUC holders are admitted to the Partnership. Section 704(c) requires the Partnership to specially allocate certain items of gain or loss among the BUC holders in order to eliminate differences between their book capital accounts (which now reflect the fair market value of Partnership property on the date the new BUCs are issued) and their tax capital accounts (which reflect the Partnership s tax basis in these assets). The effect of the allocations under Section 704(c) to a BUC holder purchasing BUCs will be essentially the same as if the tax basis of our assets were equal to the fair market value of our assets at the time of the offering. 
 
 Treatment of Securities Loans 
 
 A BUC holder whose BUCs are loaned (for example, a loan to short seller to cover a short sale of BUCs) may be treated as having disposed of those BUCs. If so, such BUC holder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those BUCs during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. As a result, during this period (i) any of our income, gain, loss or deduction allocated to those BUCs would not be reportable by the lending BUC holder, and (ii) any cash distributions received by the BUC holder as to those BUCs may be treated as ordinary taxable income. 
 Due to a lack of controlling authority, BUC holders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of income recognition from a loan of their BUCs are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding possible alternatives. The IRS has announced that it is studying issues relating to the tax treatment of short sales of partnership interests. Please read Disposition of BUCs Recognition of Gain or Loss . 
 
 Tax Treatment of Operations 
 
 Accounting Method and Taxable Year 

We use the year ending December 31 as our taxable year and the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each BUC holder will be required to include in the holder s tax return his, her, or its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Partnership for the Partnership s taxable year ending within or with the holder s taxable year. A BUC holder that has a taxable year ending on a date other than December 31 and that disposes of all its BUCs following the close of our taxable year but before the close of its taxable year will be required to include in income for its taxable year its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction, with the result that the holder will be required to include in income for its taxable year its share of more than 12 months of our income, gain, loss, and deduction. 
 
 Tax Basis, Depreciation, and Amortization 
 
 The tax basis of each of our assets will be used for purposes of computing depreciation and cost recovery deductions and, ultimately, gain or loss on the disposition of these assets. If we dispose of depreciable property by sale, foreclosure or otherwise, all or a portion of any gain, determined by reference to the amount of depreciation deductions previously taken, may be subject to the recapture rules and taxed as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Similarly, a BUC holder who has taken cost recovery or depreciation deductions with respect to property we own will likely be required to recapture some or all of those deductions as ordinary income upon a sale of its interest in us. Please read Tax Consequences of BUCs Ownership Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction . 
 
 The costs we incur in offering and selling our BUCs (called syndication expenses generally must be capitalized and cannot be deducted currently, ratably or upon our termination. While there are uncertainties regarding the classification of certain costs as organization expenses, which may be amortized by us, and as syndication expenses, which may not be amortized by us, the underwriting discounts and commissions we incur will be treated as syndication expenses. Please read Disposition of BUCs Recognition of Gain or Loss . 
 
 We are allowed a first-year bonus depreciation deduction equal to 100 of the adjusted basis of certain depreciable property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023. For property placed in service during subsequent years, the deduction is phased down by 20 per year until December 31, 2026. This depreciation deduction applies to both new and used property. However, use of the deduction with respect to used property is subject to certain anti-abuse restrictions, including the requirement that the property be acquired from an unrelated party. We can elect to forgo the depreciation bonus and use the alternative depreciation system for any class of property for a taxable year. 
 
 Disposition of BUCs 
 
 Recognition of Gain or Loss 
 
 A BUC holder will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale of such BUCs equal to the difference between the BUC holder s amount realized and tax basis in the BUCs sold. A BUC holder s amount realized generally will equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property it receives for the BUC. Gain or loss recognized by a BUC holder on the sale or exchange of a BUC held for more than one year generally will be taxable as long-term capital gain or loss. However, a portion of this gain or loss, which may be substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under Section 751 of the IRC to the extent attributable to Section 751 Assets, such as depreciation recapture and our inventory items, regardless of whether such inventory item has substantially appreciated in value. Ordinary income attributable to Section 751 Assets may exceed net taxable gain realized on the sale or exchange of a BUC and may be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the sale or exchange of a BUC. Thus, a BUC holder may recognize both ordinary income and a capital gain or loss upon a sale or exchange of a BUC. Net capital loss may offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to 3,000 of ordinary income per year. 
 
 Furthermore, as described above, the IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all of those interests (presumably including both BUCs and Preferred Units). 
 
 Special rules apply to determining the basis and holding period of a BUC holder s BUCs where less than all of a BUC holder s interest is sold. A BUC holder considering the purchase of additional BUCs or a sale of BUCs 

purchased in separate transactions is urged to consult its tax advisor as to the possible consequences of this ruling and application of the Treasury Regulations. 

Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees 
 
 BUC holders owning BUCs on the record date of any declared distribution (the Allocation Date will be entitled to receive the distribution payable with respect to their BUCs. Purchasers of BUCs after the Allocation Date will therefore not be entitled to a cash distribution on their BUCs until the next Allocation Date. 
 
 Notification Requirements 
 
 A BUC holder who sells or purchases any of his, her, or its BUCs generally is required to notify us in writing of that transaction within 30 days after the transaction (or, if earlier, January 15 of the year following the transaction in the case of a seller). Upon receiving such notifications, we are required to notify the IRS of that transaction and to furnish specified information to the transferor and transferee. Failure to notify us of a transfer of BUCs may, in some cases, lead to the imposition of penalties. However, these reporting requirements do not apply to a sale by an individual who is a citizen of the United States and who effects the sale through a broker who will satisfy such requirements. 
 
 Uniformity of BUCs 
 
 Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of BUCs, we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of the BUCs to a purchaser of these BUCs. In the absence of uniformity, we may be unable to completely comply with a number of U.S. federal income tax requirements, both statutory and regulatory. A lack of uniformity can result from the application of certain depreciation and amortization methods. Any non-uniformity could have a negative impact on the value of the BUCs. The IRS may challenge our specific methods of depreciation and amortization. If any such challenge were sustained, the uniformity of BUCs might be affected, and the gain from the sale of BUCs might be increased without the benefit of additional deductions. Please read Disposition of BUCs Recognition of Gain or Loss. 
 
 Tax-Exempt Organizations and Other Investors 
 
 Ownership of BUCs by employee benefit plans and other tax-exempt organizations as well as by non-resident alien individuals, non-U.S. corporations and other non-U.S. persons (collectively, Non-U.S. Holders raises issues unique to those investors and may have substantially adverse tax consequences to them. Prospective BUC holders that are tax-exempt entities or Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors before investing in our BUCs. Employee benefit plans and most other tax-exempt organizations, including IRAs and other retirement plans, are subject to U.S. federal income tax on unrelated business taxable income. A portion of our income allocated to the BUC holders may be unrelated business taxable income UBTI and, accordingly, will be taxable to a tax-exempt BUC holder. 
 
 Administrative Matters 
 
 Information Returns and Audit Procedures 
 
 We intend to furnish to each BUC holder, within 90 days after the close of each taxable year, specific tax information, including a Schedule K-1, which describes its share of our income, gain, loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year. In preparing this information, which will not be reviewed by counsel, we will take various accounting and reporting positions, some of which have been mentioned earlier, to determine each BUC holder s share of income, gain, loss and deduction. We cannot assure our BUC holders that those positions will yield a result that conforms to all of the requirements of the IRC, Treasury Regulations or administrative interpretations of the IRS. 

The IRS may audit our U.S. federal income tax information returns. We cannot assure prospective BUC holders that the IRS will not successfully challenge the positions we adopt, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our BUCs. Adjustments resulting from an IRS audit may require each BUC holder to adjust a prior year s tax liability, and possibly may result in an audit of the BUC holder s own return. Any audit of a BUC holder s return could result in adjustments unrelated to our returns. 
 
 Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, unless we elect to have our General Partner, Unitholders and former Unitholders take any audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the taxable year under audit. Similarly, for such taxable years, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to income tax returns filed by an entity in which we are a member or partner, it may assess and collect any taxes (including penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from such entity. 
 
 Our Partnership Representative (defined below) may, but is not required to, elect to have our General Partner, Unitholders and former Unitholders take an audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the taxable year under audit. If this election is not made, or if other adjustments are made with respect to an entity in which we are a partner or member and that does not similarly elect our then current BUC holders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such BUC holders did not own our BUCs during the taxable year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties or interest, our cash available for distribution to our BUC holders might be substantially reduced. These rules still are fairly new, and the manner in which they may apply to us in the future is uncertain. 
 
 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, we have designated our General Partner as the partnership representative Partnership Representative ). The Partnership Representative will have the sole authority to act on our behalf for purposes of, among other things, U.S. federal income tax audits and judicial review of administrative adjustments by the IRS. If we did not make such a designation, the IRS could select any person as the Partnership Representative. Further, any actions taken by us or by the Partnership Representative on our behalf with respect to, among other things, U.S. federal income tax audits and judicial review of administrative adjustments by the IRS, will be binding on us and all of our Unitholders. 
 
 Accuracy-Related Penalties 
 
 Certain penalties may be imposed as a result of an underpayment of tax that is attributable to one or more specified causes, including negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, substantial understatements of income tax and substantial valuation misstatements. No penalty will be imposed, however, for any portion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for the underpayment of that portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith regarding the underpayment of that portion. We do not anticipate that any accuracy-related penalties will be assessed against us. 
 
 State, Local, Foreign and Other Tax Considerations 
 
 In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, BUC holders may be subject to other taxes, including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangibles taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future or in which the BUC holder is a resident. We conduct business or own property in many states in the United States. Some of these states may impose an income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own property or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not presented here, each BUC holder should consider the potential impact of such taxes on its investment in us. 
 
 A BUC holder may be required to file income tax returns and pay income taxes in some or all of the jurisdictions in which we do business or own property, though such BUC holder may not be required to file a return and pay taxes in certain jurisdictions because its income from such jurisdictions falls below the jurisdiction s filing and payment requirement. Further, a BUC holder may be subject to penalties for a failure to comply with any filing or payment requirement applicable to such BUC holder. Some of the jurisdictions may require us, or we may elect, 

to withhold a percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a BUC holder who is not a resident of the jurisdiction. Withholding, the amount of which may be greater or less than a particular BUC holder s income tax liability to the jurisdiction, generally does not relieve a nonresident BUC holder from the obligation to file an income tax return. 
 
 Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the IRC, applicable Treasury regulations and additional guidance FATCA ), the Partnership generally will be required to withhold a 30 tax from any withholdable payments it makes, or is treated as making, to any Non-U.S. Holder that is an entity unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides certain certifications and other information to the Partnership sufficient to establish that it qualifies for an exemption from, or an appropriate reduction of, the FATCA tax (including information generally relating to its U.S. owners, if any). For purposes of FATCA, withholdable payments are defined, in relevant part, as payments of U.S.-source fixed, determinable annual or periodical income. 
 
 Moreover, the Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations that (i) provide that the FATCA tax will not be imposed on gross proceeds from the disposition of property that can produce U.S. source dividends or interest, as otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018, (ii) delay the time for the application of the FATCA tax to foreign passthru payments (which are attributable to withholdable payments) to a date no earlier than two years after the date of publication of final Treasury regulations applicable to foreign passthru payments, and (iii) state that taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. 
 
 IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH BUC HOLDER TO INVESTIGATE THE LEGAL AND TAX CONSEQUENCES, UNDER THE LAWS OF PERTINENT JURISDICTIONS, OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN US. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT EACH BUC HOLDER CONSULT, AND DEPEND UPON, ITS OWN TAX COUNSEL OR OTHER ADVISOR WITH REGARD TO THOSE MATTERS. FURTHER, IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH BUC HOLDER TO FILE ALL STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S., AS WELL AS U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED OF IT.
