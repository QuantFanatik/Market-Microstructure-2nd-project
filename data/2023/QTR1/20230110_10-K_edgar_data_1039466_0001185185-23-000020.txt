Overview 

NovAccess Global Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain tumor patients in the United States with plans to expand globally. We specialize in cutting-edge research related to utilizing a patient s own immune system to attack the cancer. We are filing an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) and working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain approval for human clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of our drug product for brain cancer patients. Once we have successfully completed the clinical trials and proven that the new therapy is safe and efficacious, we plan to commercialize the product. We also have expertise in successfully executing clinical trials, bringing products to market and increasing the market size of products through our advisory board. Our scientists are well versed in immunology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, molecular biology, imaging, small molecules development, gene therapy and other technical assays needed for protein and genetic analysis of cancer cells. 

In September 2020, we acquired StemVax, LLC StemVax ), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for brain tumor patients that holds an exclusive patent license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California (Cedars-Sinai) known as StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB/TLR-AD1). TLR-AD1 specifically targets glioblastoma, the most common and lethal type of adult brain tumor. Christopher Wheeler, president of StemVax, has been involved in the pre-clinical research and development of the drug candidate at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery since 1997. Dr. Wheeler began preparing the pre-IND application to obtain FDA approval to start human clinical trials. In 2021, Dr. Wheeler led pre-IND interactions with the FDA and obtained a recommended roadmap from the FDA to facilitate the filing of an IND application for a Phase I application or a Phase IIa application. We are currently executing on their recommendations and plan to submit an IND application in 2023. In August 2022, we filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for orphan drug designation ODD for TLR-AD1, which was granted in October 2022. Receiving ODD status represents a milestone in the development of TLR-AD1 and provides us with multiple incentives, including seven-year marketing exclusivity and federal tax credits, among other benefits.

Recent Events 

In October 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notified us that the FDA had approved the company s application for orphan drug designation for TLR-AD1, a vaccine immunotherapy for the treatment of aggressive brain cancers, including glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas. The FDA s Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan designation status to investigational drugs and therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation provides benefits to drug developers which may include assistance in the drug development process, financial incentives to support clinical development, tax credits for clinical costs, exemptions from certain FDA fees and the potential for seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity. 

In September 2022, the SEC declared effective our Form S-1 registering 7.5 million of our common shares held by Innovest Global, Inc., a publicly-traded diversified industrials company and significant shareholder of NovAccess. Innovest is in the process distributing its NovAcess stock to Innovest s shareholders, which will expand our shareholder base and public float. The S-1 also registered for resale shares held by or issuable to two of our lenders. 

Effective August 1, 2022, the trading of the Company s common stock was upgraded to the OTC Markets Group s OTCQB platform from the OTC Pink Market. Our shares will continue to trade under the symbol XSNX. Companies traded on the OTCQB must have independent board members, meet minimum trading and shareholders requirements, and make information about the company available regularly on an ongoing basis. 

In March 2022, we redeemed 24,400 of our Series B convertible preferred stock held by TN3, LLC, a company owned by Daniel G. Martin, at the time our sole board member and chairman. Our chief executive officer Dwain K. Irvin purchased the remaining 600 preferred shares from TN3.

Upon completion of the redemption transaction, Mr. Martin resigned from the NovAccess board and was replaced by John A. Cassarini and Dr. Irvin. Jason M. Anderson subsequently joined our board. Mr. Cassarini serves as our chairman and both of Messrs. Anderson and Cassarini are independent directors as defined in the OTCQB Market listing standards. 

Organization and History 

NovAccess Global Inc. is a Colorado corporation incorporated on February 25, 1997 as Sun River Mining, Inc. In 2003, the Company was renamed XsunX, Inc. and entered the solar business, specializing in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems. Effective August 25, 2020, we filed articles of amendment to our articles of incorporation with the Colorado Secretary of State to: effectuate a 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock; and change the name of the Company to NovAccess Global Inc. After completing the acquisition of StemVax, in September, 2020,we exited the solar business and focused all our efforts on our biopharmaceutical business. Our website is www.NovAccessGlobal.com. Information appearing on our website is not part of this report. 

Business and Operations 

Market Drivers for Immunotherapy against Cancer 

Glioblastoma is the most common adult brain tumor and has less than a 15-month median survival period after diagnosis. Despite advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy there has been no change in survival for glioblastoma patients in over 50 years. As a result, there is significant demand for novel therapies to treat brain tumors. We identify two main drivers to bring immunotherapy to market as quickly as possible: (1) the National Institutes of Health has been promoting the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer for over 10 years; and (2) the biopharmaceutical industry has been promoting the development of novel immunotherapies to treat cancer and bringing novel products to market, including Dendreon s Provenge drug to treat prostate cancer. 

What We Do 

NovAccess is biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the research and development of a new drug to treat brain cancer and other cancers. We perform pre-clinical and clinical trial experiments to bring the drugs to market. We determine if the new drug candidates are safe and effective for human use and to treat brain and other cancers. We seek to develop a new treatment or a cure for brain cancer patients and make these solutions for these patients a sound investment for our shareholders. 

We are developing novel therapies for brain cancer patients in the US and ultimately globally. Our research and development process begins with testing drug candidates through molecular and cellular based assays, animal models for diseases, testing for safety and efficacy in animal models, and human clinical trials to bring drug candidates to market. Once our products have made it to market, we plan to license their use to bigger pharmaceutical companies to better access the patient populations and provide treatment. 

Our dendritic cell-based immunotherapy utilizes a combination of Toll-like receptor (TLR) adjuvants for an enhanced anti-tumor response. The therapy is designed to utilize the patient s tumor antigens and immune cells, dendritic cells, in combination with TLR adjuvants to initiate an efficient anti-tumor immune response. This process includes obtaining the patient s tumor cells after surgery, and precursors cells that are matured into dendritic cells from peripheral blood. Antigens from the tumor cells are mixed with the dendritic cells ex-vivo to activate and sensitize them to the patient s own tumor. Once processed, the activated, sensitized dendritic cells are returned to the patient subcutaneously, where they initiate the most powerful anti-tumor responses in the body. These immune responses can locate and kill glioblastoma tumors, thereby promoting patient survival. 

The validity of this approach is supported by multiple preclinical and clinical studies, including our own, that demonstrate both the importance and feasibility of treating these tumors using a dendritic cell vaccine. We are currently seeking FDA approval to begin human clinical trials to test the hypothesis that treating glioblastoma in this manner is safe and elicits antitumor immune responses that can ultimately prolong survival. Our primary goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic vaccine for patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. We will also assess immune response metrics, radiographic response data, and survival endpoints to evaluate whether this therapeutic approach warrants further study and progression through human clinical trials. 

If the safety and efficacy of our platform technology TRL-AD1 is established during human trials, we intend to file for FDA consideration of Breakthrough Therapy Designation for TLR-AD1. A successful application for Breakthrough Designation could significantly accelerate our trial timelines and enhance the probability of TLR-AD1 s approval. In addition, while we will continue to align our trials to FDA regulations and expectations, we will monitor regulatory agencies outside of the United States, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for government-sponsored opportunities that may advance the development and approval of a safe and efficacious TLR-AD1. Our ultimate goals is to bring this novel immunotherapy to market globally and address an unmet need for brain tumor patients.

We currently do not generate revenue. In order to finance our operations, including clinical trials development and execution, we intend to raise capital through financial institutions that invest in cancer therapeutics. As we achieve milestones during the process of R D, we expect our overall value to increase. We intend to commercialize our products immediately after successful completion of clinical trials. We plan to license our products to larger biopharmaceutical companies to deliver our product to as many patients as possible once we have obtained the required FDA approvals. We expect to have other treatment candidates outside of our lead candidate moving forward as we build our patent portfolio of other therapeutics to improve patient outcomes and overall quality of health. 

The key elements of our approach include: 

Lead Drug Candidate . We perform pre-clinical R D to test hypothesis to determine if a lead product is safe and efficacious to treat cancer patients. These experiments include, molecular testing, cell culture testing and animal testing. 

Publish Data . When appropriate we publish our findings and pursue patents protection for all drug candidates to proceed with human clinical trial testing 

Human Clinical Trial Testing . At the appropriate time we will seek FDA approval to begin clinical trials on our drug candidates. We submit IND applications to the FDA to obtain this approval. 

Commercialization . After successfully completing human clinical trials and demonstrating safety and efficacy of a drug candidate, we will commercialize the product. 

Customers 

At this stage, we do not generate revenue but once we commercialize our products our customers are expected to be cancer patients and/or larger biopharmaceutical companies that we license our products through in order to complete human clinical trial testing and/or to commercialize our products. Because there is currently no immunotherapy to treat brain tumors on the market and survival rates for glioblastoma patients have not improved through standard operational procedures, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, we anticipate a significant market for our products. 

Competition 

We compete with other R D biopharmaceutical companies developing novel immunotherapies to treat brain cancer. Currently, there are no FDA approved immunotherapies available to glioblastoma patients in the market. We have a platform technology as our lead candidate. Once we have commercialized this lead product after proving it is safe and efficacious from our human clinical trial testing, we will seek approval to utilize our platform technology to treat other brain cancers, including childhood brain cancer and other cancers in general. 

Intellectual Property 

In September and June of 2017, Cedars-Sinai was issued patents, Use of toll-like receptor ligands as adjuvants to vaccination therapy for brain tumors, Patent numbers: 9764014 and 8728465. In 2018, StemVax obtained an exclusive license for these patents from Cedars-Sinai. The license term is for the full life of the patents on a country-by-country basis. 

Regulation 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA governing the development, testing, marketing and sale of our biopharmaceuticals. However, compliance with environmental laws is not a significant cost for the Company. 

Employees and Consultants 

Dr. Dwain Morris-Irvin is our chief executive officer and Neil J. Laird is our fractional chief financial officer. We also rely on qualified consultants to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we expand our business developments efforts, we plan to add staff and executive officers to respond to and assist with operations. We consider relations with our full and part-time employees and consultants to be good. To conserve cash, we have relied on equity grants to attract and retain key personnel. 

Seasonality 

Research and development in medicine has no seasonality to its operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

We have only recently refocused our business as a biopharmaceutical company and currently have no revenues or products approved for sale. In addition, we have limited staff and assets. Our stock trades on the OTC QB, but trading is limited and sporadic. As a result of these and other factors, an investment in NovAccess is inherently speculative and risky. 

Risks Related to our Business and Operations 

We will need to raise substantial funds, on an ongoing basis, for general corporate purposes and operations, including our clinical trials. 

We will need substantial additional funding, on an ongoing basis, in order to continue execution of our clinical trials, to move our product candidates towards commercialization, to continue prosecution and maintenance of our patent portfolio, to continue development and optimization of our manufacturing and distribution arrangements, and for other corporate purposes. Any financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and provisions that could limit our ability to take certain actions, preference provisions for the investors, and/or discounts, warrants, anti-dilution rights, the provision of collateral, or other incentives. Any financing will involve issuance of equity and/or debt, and these issuances will be dilutive to existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financings or that the terms will be acceptable. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail or cease some or all of our operations at any time. 

TLR-AD1 is our only technology in clinical development. 

Unlike many pharmaceutical companies that have a number of products in development, and which utilize many different technologies, we are currently dependent on the success of our TLR-AD1 platform technology. While the TLR-AD1 technology has a wide scope of potential use, and is embodied in several different product lines for different clinical situations, if the core TLR-AD1 technology is not effective or is toxic or is not commercially viable, our business could fail. We do not currently have other technologies that could provide alternative support for us. 

We are likely to continue to incur substantial losses and may never achieve profitability. 

We have a history of losses, and if we are not successful in commercializing our products, we may never achieve or sustain profitability. 

Our auditors have issued a going concern audit opinion. 

Management has determined and our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our September 30, 2022 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. A going concern opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to shareholders, in the event of liquidation. 

Our management and our independent auditors identified certain internal control deficiencies which are considered by our management and our independent auditor to be material weaknesses. 

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, our management and our independent auditor identified a certain internal control deficiency that, in the aggregate, represent material weaknesses, as described more fully in Item 9a of this report. If we do not successfully maintain a strong controlled environment this could lead to heightened risk for financial reporting mistakes and irregularities, and/or lead to a loss of public confidence in our internal controls that could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. 

As a company with a novel technology and unproven business strategy, an evaluation of our business and prospects is difficult. 

We are still in the process of developing our product candidates through clinical trials. Our technology is novel and involves mobilizing the immune system to fight a patient s cancer. Immune therapies have been pursued by many parties for decades, and have experienced many failures. In addition, our technology involves personalized treatment products, a new approach to medical products that involves new product economics and business strategies, which have not yet been shown to be commercially feasible or successful. We have not yet gone through scale-up of our operations to commercial scale. The novelty of our technology, product economics, and business strategy, and the limited scale of our operations to date, makes it difficult to assess our prospects for generating revenues commercially in the future.

We will need to expand our management and technical personnel as our operations progress, and we may not be able to recruit such additional personnel and/or retain existing personnel. 

As of September 30, 2022, we had only one full-time employee, our CEO. Other personnel are retained on a consulting or contractor basis. We are a small company with limited resources, our business prospects are uncertain and our stock price is volatile. For some or all of such reasons, we may not be able to recruit all the management, technical and other personnel we need, and/or we may not be able to retain our existing personnel. In that event, we may have to continue our operations with a small team of personnel, and our business and financial results may suffer. 

We will rely on third-party contract manufacturers and may be at risk for issues with manufacturing agreements, capacity limitations, supply disruptions, or issues with product equivalency. 

We will rely upon specialized contract manufacturers, operating in specialized GMP (clean room) manufacturing facilities, to produce our vaccine products. We will need to enter into new contractual agreements for manufacturing our vaccine, and may encounter difficulties obtaining these agreements, or the terms of such agreements may not be favorable. In addition, after these contracts are in place, the third-party contractors may have capacity limitations and/or supply disruptions, and as a client we may not be able to prevent such limitations or disruptions, and not be able to control or mitigate the impact on our programs. 

Problems with the manufacturing facilities, processes or operations of our contract manufacturer(s) could result in a failure to produce, or a delay in producing adequate supplies of our immunotherapy products. A number of factors could cause interruptions or delays, including the inability of a supplier to provide raw materials, equipment malfunctions or failures, damage to a facility due to natural disasters or otherwise, changes in FDA regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing processes, action by the FDA or by us that results in the halting or slowdown of production of components or finished products due to regulatory issues, our manufacturers going out of business or failing to produce product as contractually required, insufficient technical personnel and/or specialized facilities to produce sufficient products, and/or other factors. A number of factors could also cause possible issues about the equivalency of immunotherapy product produced in different facilities or locations, which could make it necessary for us to perform additional studies and incur additional costs and delays. Because manufacturing processes for our immunotherapy is highly complex, require specialized facilities (dedicated exclusively immunotherapy production) and personnel that are not widely available in the industry, involve equipment and training with long lead times, and are subject to lengthy regulatory approval processes, alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Difficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacturing and supply and delivery of our TLR-AD1 product candidates could require us to stop enrolling new patients into clinical trials, and/or require us to stop the trials or other programs, stop the treatment of patients in the trials or other programs, increase our costs, damage our reputation and, if our product candidates are approved for sale, cause us to lose revenue or market share if our manufacturers are unable to timely meet market demands. 

The manufacturing of our product candidates will have to be greatly scaled up for commercialization, and we do not have this type of experience. 

As is the case with any clinical trial, our Phase II clinical trial of TLR-AD1 for glioblastoma involves a number of patients that is a small fraction of the number of potential patients for whom TLR-AD1 may be applicable in the commercial market. The same will be true of our other clinical programs with TLR-AD1 or other TLR-AD1 product candidates. If our TLR-AD1 and/or other TLR-AD1 product candidates are approved for commercial sale, it will be necessary to greatly scale up the volume of manufacturing, far above the level needed for clinical trials. We do not have experience with this kind of scale-up. In addition, there are likely only a few consultants or advisors in the industry who have such experience and can provide guidance or assistance, because active immune therapies such as TLR-AD1 are a fundamentally new category of product in two major ways: these active immune therapy products consist of living cells, not chemical or biologic compounds, and the products are personalized. To our knowledge, very few of these products have successfully completed the necessary scale-up for commercialization. For example, Dendreon Corporation encountered substantial difficulties trying to scale up the manufacturing of its Provenge product for commercialization. To our knowledge, even the CAR-T products which are being commercialized have so far only scaled up to moderate product volumes. 

The necessary specialized facilities, equipment and personnel may not be available or obtainable for the scale-up of manufacturing of our product candidates. 

The manufacture of living cells requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are entirely different than what is required for the manufacturing of chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling up the manufacturing of living cell products to volume levels required for commercialization will require enormous amounts of these specialized facilities, equipment and personnel, especially where, as in the case of our TLR-AD1 product candidates, the product is personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Since living cell products are so new, and have barely begun to reach commercialization, the supply of the specialized facilities and personnel needed for them is not widely available and therefore is in the process of being developed. However, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for these specialized facilities and personnel, as large numbers of companies seek to develop T cell and other immune cell products. It may not be possible for us or our manufacturers to obtain all of the specialized facilities and personnel needed for commercialization of our TLR-AD1 product candidates, or even for further sizeable trials. This could delay or halt our commercialization and/or further substantial trials.

Our technology is novel, involves complex immune system elements, and may not prove to be effective. 

Data already obtained, or in the future obtained, from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Over the course of several decades, there have been many different immune therapy product designs and many product failures and company failures. To our knowledge, to date very few active immune therapies have been approved by the FDA, including one dendritic cell therapy and a couple of CAR-T cell therapies. The human immune system is complex, with many diverse elements, and the state of scientific understanding of the immune system is still limited. Some immune therapies previously developed by other parties showed surprising and unexpected toxicity in clinical trials. Other immune therapies developed by other parties delivered promising results in early clinical trials, but failed in later stage clinical trials. Although we believe the results from our animal studies of TLR-AD1 for newly diagnosed glioblastoma were quite positive, those results may not be achieved in our later stage clinical trials. 

Clinical trials for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. 

The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is expensive, lengthy and uncertain. Costs and timing of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to any or all of the following non-exclusive reasons: the duration of the clinical trial; the number of sites included in the trials; the countries in which the trial is conducted; the length of time required and ability to enroll eligible patients; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; per patient trial costs; third-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner; our final product candidates having different properties in humans than in laboratory testing; the need to suspend or terminate our clinical trials; insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of necessary materials to conduct our trials; potential additional safety monitoring, or other conditions required by the FDA regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; problems engaging independent review boards, or IRBs, to oversee trials or in obtaining and maintaining IRB approval of studies; the duration of patient follow-up; the efficacy and safety profile of a product candidate; the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals; and the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights. 

Late-stage clinical trials, (e.g., Phase III clinical trials) for glioblastoma patients, are especially expensive, typically requiring tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and take years to reach their outcomes. These outcomes often fail to reproduce the results of earlier trials. It is often necessary to conduct multiple late-stage trials (including multiple Phase III trials) in order to obtain sufficient results to support product approval, which further increases the expense and time involved. Sometimes trials are further complicated by changes in requirements while the trials are under way (for example, when the standard of care changes for the disease that is being studied in the trial, or when there are changes in the scientific understanding of the disease or the treatment, and/or changes in the competitive landscape.) There has been a very large proliferation of new treatments in various stages of development, as well as some new product approvals, for brain cancer. Any of our current or future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect, or may never gain approval, either of which could delay or stop the commercialization of our TLR-AD1 product candidates. 

We have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials, or collecting, confirming and analyzing trial data, and we rely on third parties to conduct these activities. 

We rely on third parties to assist us, on a contract services basis, in managing and monitoring all of our clinical trials as well as the collection, confirmation and analysis of the trial data. We do not have experience conducting Phase III clinical trials, or collecting, validating and analyzing trial data by ourselves without third party service firms, nor do we have experience in supervising such third parties in managing multi-hundred patient clinical trials, and collecting, validating and analyzing the data for a Phase III trial for glioblastoma. Our lack of experience and/or our reliance on these third-party service firms may result in delays or failure to complete these trials and/or the data collection, validation and analyses successfully or on time. If the third parties fail to perform, we may not be able to find sufficient alternative suppliers of those services in a reasonable time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

We may fail to comply with regulatory requirements. 

Our success will be dependent upon our ability, and our collaborative partners abilities, to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements in multiple countries, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and safety reporting obligations. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, total or partial suspension of regulatory approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, recalls or seizures of products, operating and production restrictions and criminal prosecutions.

Regulatory approval of our product candidates may be withdrawn at any time. 

After any regulatory approval has been obtained for medical products (including any early or conditional approval), the product and the manufacturer are subject to continual review, including the review of adverse experiences and clinical results that are reported after our products are made available to patients, and there can be no assurance that approval will not be withdrawn or restricted. Regulators may also subject approvals to restrictions or conditions or impose post-approval obligations on the holders of these approvals, and the regulatory status of such products may be jeopardized if such obligations are not fulfilled. If post-approval studies are required, these studies may involve significant time and expense. 

The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our products will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA or other regulators. 

The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with the product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. We will continue to be subject to the FDA and other regulatory requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information for all of our product candidates, even those that the FDA or other regulator had approved. If we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and other adverse consequences. 

We may not be successful in negotiating reimbursement. 

If our TLR-AD1 product obtains regulatory approval, commercialization will be difficult and may not be feasible unless we obtain coverage by health insurance and/or national health systems for reimbursement of our product price. Obtaining coverage by health insurance and/or national health systems will be difficult and we do not have experience with this process. Our TLR-AD1 product is a fully personalized, individual product and, as a result, is expected to be expensive. In addition, our TLR-AD1 product involves a cost structure (with much of the costs upfront, in connection with the manufacturing of the personalized TLR-AD1 product for a patient) that is different than traditional drugs and may require different reimbursement arrangements. These factors may make our negotiations for reimbursement more difficult. We may not be successful in negotiating or obtaining reimbursement, or obtaining it on acceptable or viable terms. 

Our product candidates will require a different distribution model than conventional therapeutic products, and this may impede commercialization of our product candidates. 

Our TLR-AD1 product candidates consist of living human immune cells. Such products are entirely different from chemical or biologic drugs, and require different handling, distribution and delivery than chemical or biologic drugs. One crucial difference is that the biomaterial ingredients (immune cells and tumor tissue) from which we make TLR-AD1 products and the finished TLR-AD1 products themselves are subject to time constraints in the shipping and handling. The biomaterial ingredients come from the medical centers to the manufacturing facility fresh and not frozen, and must arrive within a certain window of time and in usable condition. Performance failures by the medical center or the courier company can result in biomaterials that are not usable, in which case it may not be possible to make TLR-AD1 product for the patient involved. The finished TLR-AD1 products are frozen, and must remain frozen throughout the process of distribution and delivery to the medical center or physician s office, until the time of administration to the patient, and cannot be handled at room temperature until then or their viability will be lost. Each product shipment for each patient must be tracked and managed individually. For all of these reasons, among others, we will not be able to simply use the distribution networks and processes that already exist for conventional drugs. It may take time for shipping companies, hospitals, pharmacies and physicians to adapt to the requirements for handling, distribution and delivery of these products, which may adversely affect our commercialization. 

We lack sales and marketing experience, and our product candidates will require different marketing and sales methods and personnel than conventional therapeutic products. 

The commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon the strength of our sales and marketing efforts. We do not have a marketing or sales force and have no experience in marketing or sales of products like our lead product, TLR-AD1 for glioblastoma, or our additional products. To fully commercialize our product candidates, we will need to recruit and train marketing staff and a sales force with technical expertise and ability to manage the distribution of our TLR-AD1 for glioblastoma. As an alternative, we could seek assistance from a corporate partner or a third-party services firm with a large distribution system and a large direct sales force. However, since our TLR-AD1 products are living cell, immune therapy products, and these are a fundamentally new and different type of product than are on the market today, we would still have to train our partner s or such services firm s personnel about our products, and would have to make changes in their distribution processes and systems to handle our products. We may be unable to recruit and train effective sales and marketing forces or our own, or of a partner or a services firm, and/or doing so may be more costly and difficult than anticipated. These factors may result in significant difficulties in commercializing our product candidates, and we may be unable to generate significant revenues.

The availability and amount of potential reimbursement for our product candidates by government and private payers is uncertain and may be delayed or inadequate. 

The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payers is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments, such as cancer treatments. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products like ours, as there have been very few products similar to ours to date. We are aware of only a few active immune therapies that have reached the stage of reimbursement decision making processes, including one dendritic cell therapy and a couple of CAR-T cell therapies. Although CMS has approved coverage and reimbursement for some of these products, and private payers seem to be following suit in the US, there remain substantial questions and concerns about reimbursement for these products, especially outside the US. 

Various factors could increase the difficulties for our TLR-AD1 products to obtain reimbursement. Costs and/or difficulties associated with the reimbursement of Provenge and/or T cell therapies could create an adverse environment for reimbursement of other immune therapies, such as our TLR-AD1 products. Approval of other competing products (drugs and/or devices) for the same disease indications could make the need for our products and the cost-benefit balance less compelling. The cost structure of our product is not a typical cost structure for medical products, as the majority of our costs are incurred up front, when the manufacturing of the personalized product is done. Our atypical cost structure may not be accommodated in any reimbursement for our products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be adversely affected. 

In markets outside the U.S., the prices of medical products are subject to direct price controls and/or to reimbursement with varying price control mechanisms, as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the U.S. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Accordingly, in markets outside the U.S., the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the U.S. and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. 

Competition in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry is intense, rapidly expanding and most of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. 

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. A growing number of other companies, such as Juno, Kite Bellicum, Agenus, Asterias, Dandrit, Immunicum, Sotio, AiVita and many others, are actively involved in the research and development of immune therapies or cell-based therapies for cancer. In addition, other novel technologies for cancer are under development or commercialization, such as checkpoint inhibitor drugs (which are being rapidly developed by numerous big pharma companies including BMS, Merck, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche and others) and various T cell-based therapies (which are also being rapidly developed by numerous companies with extraordinary resource backing), as well as the electro-therapy device of NovoCure. Additionally, many companies are actively involved in the research and development of monoclonal antibody-based cancer therapies. Currently, a substantial number of antibody-based products are approved for commercial sale for cancer therapy, and a large number of additional ones are under development, including late-stage trials. Many other third parties compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat cancer, including: biopharmaceutical companies; biotechnology companies; pharmaceutical companies; academic institutions; and other research organizations, as well as some medical device companies (e.g., NovoCure and MagForce Nano Technologies AG). Our competitors are likely to examine combination therapies or use of their therapeutic candidates in conjunction with devices and companion diagnostic technologies, including molecular diagnostic platforms. 

We face extensive competition from companies developing new treatments for brain cancer. These include a variety of immune therapies, as mentioned above (including T cell-based therapies and checkpoint inhibitor drugs), as well as a variety of small molecule drugs and biologics drugs. There are also a number of existing drugs used for the treatment of brain cancer that may compete with our product, including, Avastin (Roche Holding AG), Gliadel (Eisai Co. Ltd.), and Temodar (Merck Co., Inc.), as well as NovoCure s electrotherapy device. 

Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and sales than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

Table of Contents 

Our competitors may complete their clinical development more rapidly than we and our products do, may develop more effective or affordable products, or may achieve earlier or longer patent protection or earlier product marketing and sales. Any products developed by us may be rendered obsolete and non-competitive. 

We may be exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance may not be available or cover these claims. 

Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale and use of therapeutic products. Our insurance may not cover any claims made and insurance coverage may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Insurance that we obtain may not be adequate to cover claims against us. Regardless of whether they have any merit or not, and regardless of their eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in substantially decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants or physicians, and/or loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material. 

We may be subject to environmental regulatory requirements, and could fail to meet such requirements, and we do not carry insurance against environmental damage or injury claims. 

We may need to store, handle, use and dispose of controlled hazardous and biological materials in our business. Our development activities may result in our becoming subject to regulatory requirements, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, we could be subject to substantial fines and other sanctions, delays in research and production, and increased operating costs. In addition, if regulated materials were improperly released at our current or former facilities or at locations to which we send materials for disposal, we could be liable for substantial damages and costs, including cleanup costs and personal injury or property damages, and we could incur delays in research and production and increased operating costs. 

Collaborations play an important role in our business and could be vulnerable to competition or termination. 

We work with scientists and medical professionals at academic and other institutions, some of whom have conducted research for us or have assisted in developing our research and development strategy. These scientists and medical professionals are collaborators, not our employees. They may have commitments to, or contracts with, other institutions or businesses (including competitors) that limit the amount of time they have available to work with us. We have little control over these individuals. We can only expect that they devote time to NovAccess and our programs as required by any license, consulting or sponsored research agreements we may have with them. In addition, these individuals may have arrangements with other companies to assist in developing technologies that may compete with our products. If these individuals do not devote sufficient time and resources to our programs, or if they provide substantial assistance to our competitors, our business could be seriously harmed. 

Our business could be adversely affected by new legislation or product related issues. 

Changes in applicable legislation and/or regulatory policies or discovery of problems with the product, production process, site or manufacturer may result in delays in bringing products to market, the imposition of restrictions on the product s sale or manufacture, including the possible withdrawal of the product from the market, or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our business could be adversely affected by animal rights activists. 

Our business activities have involved animal testing and could involve further animal testing, as this type of testing is required before new medical products can be tested in clinical trials in human patients. Animal testing has been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to stop animal testing by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas. To the extent that the activities of these groups are successful, our business could be adversely affected. Negative publicity about us, our pre-clinical trials and our product candidates could also adversely affect our business. 

Multiple late-stage clinical trials of TLR-AD1 for glioblastoma, our lead product, may be required before we can obtain regulatory approval. 

Typically, companies conduct multiple late-stage clinical trials of their product candidates before seeking product approval. Our application for approval of a Phase IIa clinical trial is a relatively early-stage clinical trial and we must prove safety and efficacy before we can obtain FDA approval to start a late stage clinical trial. We may be unable to prove safety and efficacy or obtain approval to start late-stage clinical trials. This would substantially delay our commercialization, and might not be possible to complete, due to development or approval of competing products, lack of funding, or other factors. In addition, a rapidly growing number of products are under development for brain cancer, including immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitor drugs and T cell-based therapies, and some (e.g., NovoCure s device) have been approved in the U.S. It is possible that the standard of care for brain cancer could change before we are approved to start a Phase II trial and analysis of its results, or before we are able to seek approval for late-stage trials and commercialization. This could necessitate further clinical trials with our TLR-AD1 product candidate for brain cancer, which may not be feasible.

Changes in manufacturing methods for TLR-AD1 could require us to conduct equivalency studies and/or additional clinical trials. 

With biologics products, in some cases the process is the product: i.e., the manufacturing process is considered to be as integral to the product as is the composition of the product itself. If any changes are made in the manufacturing process, and these changes are considered material by the regulatory authorities, the company sponsor may be required to conduct equivalency studies to show that the product is equivalent under the changed manufacturing processes as under the original manufacturing processes, or the company sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials. In addition, if there are multiple manufacturing locations, equivalency studies may be required to show that the products produced in the respective facilities are substantially the same. Our manufacturing processes have undergone some changes during or since the early clinical trials, and we have multiple manufacturing locations. Accordingly, we may be required to conduct equivalency studies, and/or additional clinical trials, before we can obtain product approval, unless the regulatory authorities are satisfied that the changes in processes do not affect the quality, efficacy or safety of the product, and satisfied that the products made in each manufacturing location are substantially the same. 

We may not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates or there may be a delay in obtaining such approvals. 

Our products and our ongoing development activities are subject to regulation by regulatory authorities in the countries in which we and our collaborators and distributors wish to test, manufacture or market our products. For instance, the FDA will regulate our product in the U.S. Regulatory approval by the FDA will be subject to the evaluation of data relating to the quality, efficacy and safety of the product for its proposed use, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will find our data sufficient to support product approval of TLR-AD1. In addition, the endpoint against which the data is measured must be acceptable to the regulatory authorities, and the statistical analysis plan for how the data will be evaluated must also be acceptable to the regulatory authorities. 

The time required to obtain regulatory approval varies between countries. In the U.S., for products without Fast Track status, it can take up to 18 months after submission of an application for product approval to receive the FDA s decision. Even with Fast Track status, FDA review and decision can take up to 12 months. At present, we do not have Fast Track status for our lead product, TLR-AD1 for glioblastoma. 

Different regulators may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant, or may require additional data before granting an approval, even if regulatory approval may have been granted by other regulators. Regulatory approval may be delayed, limited or denied for a number of reasons, including clinical data, the product not meeting safety or efficacy requirements or any relevant manufacturing processes or facilities not meeting applicable requirements as well as case load at the regulatory agency at the time. 

We may not obtain or maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity. 

While we plan to submit an application for orphan drug status like the two previous generations of our dendritic cell-based immunotherapy, there is no guarantee that we will obtain approval for orphan drug status for TLR-AD1, our lead product, for glioblastoma. As a result, we may not receive the benefits associated with orphan drug designation (including the benefit providing for market exclusivity for a number of years). This may result from a failure to obtain orphan drug status, or result from a competing product reaching the market that has an orphan designation for the same disease indication. Under U.S. rules for orphan drugs, if a competing product reaches the market before ours does, the competing product could potentially obtain a scope of market exclusivity that limits or precludes our product from being sold in the U.S. for seven years. 

Our intellectual property rights may be overturned, narrowed or blocked, and may not provide sufficient commercial protection for our product candidates, or third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property. 

The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Patent laws afford only limited protection and may not protect our rights to the extent necessary to sustain any competitive advantage we may have. Moreover, patents and patent applications relating to living cell products are relatively new, involve complex factual and legal issues, and are largely untested in litigation, and as a result are uncertain. Any patent applications may not result in patents being issued which adequately protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing the same or competitive technologies and products. As a result, we may not be able to obtain meaningful patent protection for our commercial products, and our business may suffer as a result. Third parties may challenge our existing patents, and these challenges could result in overturning or narrowing some of our patents. Even if our patents are not challenged, third parties could assert that their patents block our use of technology covered by some or all of our patents.

We have taken security measures (including execution of confidentiality agreements) to protect our proprietary information, especially proprietary information that is not covered by patents or patent applications. These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. 

We may be exposed to claims or lawsuits that our products infringe patents or other proprietary rights of other parties. 

Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have not conducted a comprehensive freedom-to-operate review to determine whether our proposed business activities or use of certain of the technology covered by patent rights owned by us would infringe patents issued to third parties. 

There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. The patent landscape is especially uncertain in regard to cell therapy products, as it involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference proceedings, inter partes reexamination, or post grant review before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from the third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. If the infringement is found to be willful, we could be liable for treble damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. 

Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

Risks Related to Our Company and Stock 

You may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes and upon the exercise of warrants, conversion of convertible debt, or conversion of preferred stock. 

In the future, we may issue additional equity securities for capital raising purposes, in connection with hiring or retaining employees, to fund acquisitions, or for other business purposes. In addition, as of September 30, 2022, we have outstanding debt that could presently or upon default be converted into 13.0 million shares of our common stock, preferred shares convertible into 6.0 million shares of our stock, and warrants exercisable for up to 4.5 million shares of our stock. In addition, we have issued 1.6 million shares of our common stock to one of our lenders for loan commitment fees, and guaranteed that the lender will be able to sell the shares for at least 1.15 million; if the lender sells the shares for less, we must issue the lender additional shares or make a cash payment to make them whole. The future issuance of any additional shares of common stock will dilute our current shareholders and may create downward pressure on the value of our shares. In addition, just the potential for the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock pursuant to the warrants, convertible notes and preferred shares could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an overhang and in anticipation of which the market price of our stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also hinder our ability to raise additional equity capital at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.

Our CEO currently has the ability to determine the election of our directors and the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders. 

As of September 30, 2022, our chief executive officer Dwain K. Morris-Irvin controls common and preferred shares that give him the right to cast 60.5 of the vote on all matters submitted to our shareholders, including the election of directors. As a result, Dr. Irvin has the ability to determine the outcome of issues submitted to our shareholders. Although our directors and executive officers, including Dr. Irvin, have a fiduciary obligation to the company s shareholders, their interests may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders. As a consequence, it may be difficult for the other shareholders to remove our board members. Dr. Irvin s voting control could also deter unsolicited takeovers, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. 

Our articles of incorporation allow for our board to create a new series of preferred stock without further approval by our shareholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. 

We are authorized to issue more than 49.9 million shares of preferred stock that has not been previously designated or issued, and our board has the authority to define the relative rights and preferences of these shares of preferred stock without further shareholder approval. As a result, our board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board could authorize the issuance of a new series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing shareholders. The issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future. 

Our articles of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control. 

Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. We are authorized to issue more than 49.9 million shares of preferred stock that has not been previously designated or issued. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board without shareholder approval. Specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and as a result preserve control by the present management. 

We have more than 1.9 billion shares of authorized but unissued common stock. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for future issuance without shareholder approval. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or tender offers or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things: provide our board with the ability to alter the bylaws without shareholder approval; deny shareholders cumulative voting rights in the election of our directors; place limitations on the removal of our directors; and provide that vacancies on our board may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum. 

The market price of our common stock is volatile and can be adversely affected by numerous factors. 

The share prices of publicly traded biotechnology and emerging pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies without consistent product revenues and earnings, can be highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future. The price which investors may realize in sales of their shares of our stock may be materially different than the price at which our stock is quoted, and will be influenced by a large number of factors, some specific to us and our operations, and some unrelated to our operations. These factors may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate frequently and substantially. Relevant factors may include large purchases or sales of our common stock, shorting of our stock, positive or negative events, commentaries or publicity relating to our company, management or products, or other companies, management or products, including other immune therapies for cancer or immune therapies or cancer therapies generally, positive or negative events relating to healthcare and the overall pharmaceutical and biotech sector, the publication of research by securities analysts and changes in recommendations of securities analysts, legislative or regulatory changes, and/or general economic conditions. In the past, shareholder litigation, including class action litigation, has been brought against other companies that experienced volatility in the market price of their shares or unexpected or adverse developments in their business. Whether or not meritorious, litigation can result in substantial costs, divert management s attention and resources, and harm the company s financial condition and results of operations.

Our Common Stock is considered a penny stock and may be difficult to sell. 

The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Historically, the price of our stock has fluctuated greatly. As of the date of this filing, the market price of our common stock is less than 5.00 per share, and therefore is a penny stock according to SEC rules. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1.0 million or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the broker-dealer must deliver, before the transaction, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability or decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to sell our stock and may result in decreased liquidity for our stock and increased transaction costs for sales and purchases of our stock as compared to other securities. 

The requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other U.S. securities laws impose substantial costs, and may drain our resources and distract our management. 

We are subject to certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls. Substantial efforts and resources must be expended to maintain a controlled environment, which is difficult for a small company like ours. Continued additional investments and management time to meet these requirements will be necessary since control weaknesses raise the risk of future material errors in our financial statements. We may not be able to maintain effective controls over time. If we have material weaknesses in the future, this may subject us to SEC enforcement action, which could include monetary fines or other equitable remedies that could be detrimental to the ongoing business of the Company. 

We do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our stock must come from increases in the market price of our stock. 

We have not paid any cash dividends on our stock to date in our history, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Also, any credit agreements which we may enter into with institutional lenders may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, any return on your investment in our stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our stock, which may not occur. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This annual report contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical facts, including, without limitation, statements that are identified by words like may, could, would, should, will, believe, expect, anticipate, plan, predict, estimate, target, project, intend, or similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our current expectations, estimates and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition and operations of our business. These statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. You should not rely solely on these forward-looking statements and should consider all uncertainties and risks throughout this document. Forward-looking statements are only predictions and not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events.

Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements in this report are based on reasonable assumptions when they were made, we cannot assure you that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. We believe the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, as they are based on current expectations. Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: 

If we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval for our novel cancer treatment, we will have no source of revenue. 

We have incurred significant net losses from operations and must raise additional capital to fund our operations, commercialize our products, and repay our debt. 

We have limited management resources and only one full time employee who we are dependent upon for our success, and the loss of any member of our management team would negatively impact our operations. 

The exercise of our outstanding warrants, conversion of our convertible debt, or conversion of our outstanding preferred stock would result in significant dilution for our common shareholders. 

Our CEO controls shares of our common and preferred stock that that give him the ability to determine the outcome of issues submitted to our shareholders, including the election of directors. 

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and also could cause actual results to differ materially from those included, contemplated or implied by the forward-looking statements made in this report, and you should not consider the factors listed above to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements concerning NovAccess or other matters addressed in this report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section of this report, the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, especially in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this report.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report. Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents that the Company files from time to time with the SEC. 

Organization 

NovAccess Global Inc. is a Colorado corporation that was formerly known as XsunX, Inc. and Sun River Mining Inc.

Business Plan 

In 2020, we transitioned our operations from solar contracting operations to the commercialization of developmental healthcare solutions in the biotechnology, medical, and health and wellness markets. On June 2, 2020, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Innovest Global, Inc. to acquire StemVax for 7.5 million shares of our unregistered common stock. The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2020. 

StemVax, LLC StemVax is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for brain tumor patients that holds an exclusive patent license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California (Cedars-Sinai) known as StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB/TLR-AD1). TLR-AD1 specifically targets glioblastoma, the most common and lethal type of adult brain tumor. Christopher Wheeler, President of StemVax, has been involved in the pre-clinical research and development of the drug candidate at Cedars-Sinai Department of Neurosurgery since 1997. Dr. Wheeler began preparing the pre-IND application to obtain FDA approval to start human clinical trials. In 2021, Dr. Wheeler led pre-IND interactions with the FDA and obtained a recommended roadmap from the FDA to facilitate the filing of an IND application for a Phase I application or a Phase IIa application. We are currently executing on their recommendations and plan to submit an IND application in 2023. In August 2022, we filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for orphan drug designation ODD for TLR-AD1, which was granted in October 2022. Receiving ODD status represents a milestone in the development of TLR-AD1 and provides us with multiple incentives, including seven-year marketing exclusivity and federal tax credits, among other benefits. 

We believe that investing in the biotechnology industry will significantly increase value for our shareholders. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor or that we can locate, acquire and finance the acquisition of biotechnology companies. 

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 

Revenue and Cost of Sales 

The Company generated no revenue or cost of goods sold in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses decreased by 1,371,321 during fiscal 2022 to 1,181,534 as compared to 2,552,855 for fiscal 2021. The decrease in SG A expenses was related primarily due to the Company recognizing 962,000 in in stock compensation expense in fiscal 2021 compared to 0 recognized in fiscal 2022; a decrease of 185,564 in professional fees for investor advisory, legal and accounting services; decrease of 264,085 in outside services provided by TN3 under the management services agreement (please see Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for additional details); as well as an decrease of 57,775 in payroll related expenses, which was marginally offset by increase in insurance cost. 

Research and development expenses 

The research and development expense increased by 40,030 for the fiscal year 2022 to 186,115 as compared to 146,085 for the fiscal year 2021 as we invested more consultant and employee time in preparing for the IND application to the FDA. 

Other Income/(Expenses) 

Other income/(expenses) declined by 534,775 from other income of 186,465 for fiscal 2021 to other expenses of 348,310 for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to the increase in interest expense of 1,316,583 and an expense in fiscal 2022 of 961,000 relating to a price guarantee on shares issued as a commitment fee to one of our note holders, and a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 54,813. These expenses were partially offset by the Company recognizing a gain on the net change in fair market value of the derivative instruments of 2,084,242 in fiscal 2022 compared to a gain of 548,112 in fiscal 2021, and a gain on extinguishment of derivatives amounting to 277,716. The estimates of fair market value are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price, volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on managements estimates. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period, therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 

Net Loss 

For fiscal year 2022, our net loss was 1,715,959 as compared to a net loss of 2,512,475 for fiscal 2021. the decrease in net loss of 796,516 was due to the decrease in SG A, partially offset by the increase in other expenses as described above.

Table of Contents 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had a working capital deficit at September 30, 2022 of 4,653,066, as compared to a working capital deficit of 3,762,214, as of September 30, 2021. The decrease of 890,852 in working capital deficit was the result of an increase in accounts payable 165,711, decrease in derivative liability on convertible notes amounting to 1,486,610, increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities amounting to 877,381, increase in amounts due to related parties of 103,925 and increase in convertible notes payable amounting to 1,147,842, and decrease in cash of 115,417 partially offset by increased prepaid expenses of 33,184. 

For fiscal 2022, our cash flow used by operating activities was 903,489, as compared to cash flow used by operating activities of 682,333 for fiscal 2021. The increase of 221,156 in cash flow used by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities described above as well as the decrease in net loss being primarily the result of non-cash charges recorded in the statement of operations. 

Cash flow used by investing activities was 0 in fiscal 2022 and 2021. 

Cash flow provided by financing activities was 787,072 for fiscal 2022, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 862,823 during fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the mix of funds raised by selling equity and debt instruments and repayment of convertible notes and bridge loans. 

The Company will need to raise additional funds to finance its ongoing operations, complete its IND application to the FDA and to make payments under its loan agreements. We expect this will require at least 3.0 million through December 31, 2023. We plan to raise this capital through the issuance of additional common stock as well as obtaining additional debt as needed. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these consolidated financial statements include the estimate of useful lives of property and equipment, the deferred tax valuation allowance, the fair value of stock options, and derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Because NovAccess is a smaller reporting company as defined by the SEC we are not required to provide additional market risk disclosure.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

Stockholders of NovAccess Global, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NovAccess Global, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations in current and prior periods and has an accumulated deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Derivative Liabilities 

As discussed in Note 2, 4 and 6, the Company borrows funds through the use of convertible notes payable that contain a conversion price that may be fixed or fluctuates with the stock price. 

Auditing management s estimates of the fair value of the derivative liability involves significant judgements and estimates given the embedded conversion features of the notes. 

To evaluate the appropriateness of the fluctuation of the conversion price, the embedded conversion feature requires bifurcation from the host contract and is recorded as a liability subject to market adjustments as of each reporting period. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining derivative liability values for these convertible note agreements, including the use of a specialist engaged by management.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management team, with the participation of our chief executive officer, Dwain K. Irvin, and chief financial officer, Neil J. Laird, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of NovAccess disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2022. Based upon this evaluation, Messrs. Morris-Irvin and Laird concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2022 due to the material control weakness discussed below. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The NovAccess management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

Our management team, with the participation of Messrs Irvin and Laird, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria designated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based upon this evaluation, Messrs. Irvin and Laird concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2022 due to the material control weakness discussed below. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, other than the material control weakness discussed below 

Material Control Weakness Relating to the Accounting for Convertible Promissory Notes and Derivatives 

The company has entered into a number of promissory note transactions that include a number of complex derivative features and debt discounts. These include original offer discounts, other issuance costs, warrants, commitment shares and conversion features. There were a number of errors in the calculation of fair value for each of these features that we did not identify in the company s initial review of the financials. These have been adjusted in the numbers included in this report and the company is taking steps to obtain better technical advice on the treatment of these instruments in the future.
