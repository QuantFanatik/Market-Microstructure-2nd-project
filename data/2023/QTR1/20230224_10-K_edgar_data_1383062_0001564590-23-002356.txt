ITEM 1. 
 
 BUSINESS 

 Introduction 
 Invesco DB Energy Fund (the Fund ), a separate series of Invesco DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust (the Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust organized in seven separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 Invesco Capital Management LLC Invesco has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner holds 40 general shares (the General Shares of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. 
 The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Excess Return (the Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the energy sector. The commodities comprising the Index are Light Sweet Crude Oil, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (also commonly known as Heating Oil), Brent Crude Oil, RBOB Gasoline (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB and Natural Gas (each, an Index Commodity, and collectively, the Index Commodities ). 
 The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation or depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC and certain futures exchanges impose position limits on futures contracts that reference Index Commodities (the Index Contracts ). As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions (the Authorized Participants in one or more blocks of 100,000 Shares Creation Units ). The Fund commenced investment operations on January 3, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on January 5, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca ). 
 Index Description 
 The Managing Owner pays Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (the Index Sponsor a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. 
 These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the Management Fee and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund. 
 Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index. 
 The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (collectively, Deutsche Bank ). The DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Excess

Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation to take the needs of the Managing Owner or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Index. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Fund. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation or liability in connection with the administration or trading of the Fund. 
 NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN.

 No purchaser, seller or holder of the Shares of this Fund, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any Deutsche Bank trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote this Fund without first contacting Deutsche Bank to determine whether Deutsche Bank s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank. 
 The Index Sponsor may from time-to-time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties. 
 The Index is composed of notional amounts of each of the underlying Index Commodities. The notional amount of each Index Commodity included in the Index is intended to reflect the changes in market value of each such Index Commodity within the Index. The closing level of the Index is calculated on each business day by the Index Sponsor based on the closing price of the commodity futures contracts for each of the Index Commodities and the notional amount of such Index Commodity. 
 The Index is rebalanced annually in November to ensure that each of the Index Commodities is weighted in the same proportion that such Index Commodities were weighted on June 4, 1990 (the Base Date ). The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Commodities.

 The composition of the Index may be adjusted in the event that the Index Sponsor is not able to calculate the closing prices of the Index Commodities. 
 The Index includes provisions for the replacement of futures contracts as they approach maturity. This replacement takes place over a period of time in order to lessen the impact on the market for the futures contracts being replaced. With respect to each Index Commodity, the Fund employs a rule-based approach when it rolls from one futures contract to another. Rather than select a new futures contract based on a predetermined schedule (e.g., monthly), each Index Commodity rolls from one contract to another futures contract that is intended to generate the most favorable implied roll yield under prevailing market conditions. Where there is an upward-sloping price curve for futures contracts, the implied roll yield is expected to be negative, which is a market condition called contango . Contango exists when contract prices are higher in distant delivery months than in nearer delivery months, typically due to costs associated with storing a given physical commodity for a longer period. Rolling in a contangoed market will tend to cause a drag on returns from futures trading. The Index s selection of a new futures contract on an Index Commodity in such market conditions is designed to minimize the impact of negative roll yield. Additionally, in instances of particular market stress, futures contracts for the month next to occur (e.g., the April 2023 futures contract available in March 2023) may trade significantly lower than futures contracts with delivery in later months, typically indicating an oversupply of the reference commodity, in what is referred to as a super contango market. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors below for a discussion of the risks associated with a super contango market. 
 Conversely, where there is a downward-sloping price curve for futures contracts, the implied roll yield is expected to be positive which is a market condition called backwardation. Backwardation exists when prices are higher for contracts with shorter-term expirations than those with longer-term expirations, a condition that is typically associated with commodities that are consumed quickly instead of being held in storage. Rolling in a backwardated market will tend to enhance returns from futures trading. The Index s selection of a new futures contract on an Index Commodity in such market conditions is designed to maximize the impact of positive roll yield. The Index takes the impact of implied roll yield into consideration by selecting, as the replacement for an expiring futures contract, the futures contract with a delivery month within the next thirteen months that generates the most favorable implied roll yield under the current market conditions. 
 Returns from futures trading are called excess return, which is the combined return based on the spot prices of Index Commodities and the roll yield from trading Index Contracts. 
 The Index is calculated in USD on an excess return (unfunded) basis, which means that the Index reflects only the return associated with spot prices for Index Commodities and the roll yield associated with trading Index Contracts. Unlike the Index, the Fund also holds as collateral securities that are expected to generate income, including Treasury Securities, money market mutual funds, and T-Bill ETFs. These securities are held with the Custodian. In addition, Treasury Securities for deposit may be held with the Commodity Broker as margin for the Fund s futures positions. The Index does not reflect any corresponding income characteristics. 
 The futures contract price for each Index Commodity will be the exchange closing price for such Index Commodity on a day on which the appropriate exchange is open for business (an Index Business Day ). If a weekday is not an Exchange Business Day (as defined in the following sentence) but is an Index Business Day, the exchange closing price from the previous Index Business Day will be used for each Index Commodity. Exchange Business Day means, in respect of an Index Commodity, a day that is a trading day for such Index Commodity on the relevant exchange (unless either an Index disruption event or force majeure event has occurred). 
 On the first Index Business Day of each month (the Verification Date ), each Index Commodity futures contract will be tested in order to determine whether to continue including it in the Index. If the Index Commodity futures contract requires delivery of the underlying commodity in the next month, known as the Delivery Month, a new Index Commodity futures contract will be selected for inclusion in the Index. For example, if the first Index Business Day is May 1 of the current year, and the Delivery Month of the Index Commodity futures contract currently in the Index is June of the current year, a new Index Commodity futures contract with a later Delivery Month will be selected. 
 For each underlying Index Commodity in the Index, the new Index Commodity futures contract selected will be the Index Commodity futures contract with the best possible implied roll yield based on the closing price for each eligible Index Commodity futures contract. Eligible Index Commodity futures contracts are any Index Commodity futures contracts having a Delivery Month (i) no sooner than the month after the Delivery Month of the Index Commodity futures contract currently in the Index, and (ii) no later than the thirteenth month after the Verification Date. For example, if the first Index Business Day is May 1 of the current year and the Delivery Month of an Index Contract currently in the Index is June of the current year, the Delivery Month of an eligible new Index Commodity futures contract must be between July of the current year and June of the following year. The implied roll yield is then calculated and the Index Contract with the best possible implied roll yield under the current market conditions is then selected. If two 
 3 

futures contracts have the same implied roll yield, the futures contract with the minimum number of months prior to the Delivery Month is selected. 
 After the futures contract selection, the monthly roll for each Index Commodity subject to a roll in that particular month unwinds the old futures contract and enters a position in the new futures contract. This takes place between the second and sixth Index Business Day of the month. 
 On each day during the roll period, new notional holdings are calculated. The calculations for the futures contracts on the old Index Commodities that are leaving the Index and the futures contracts on the new Index Commodities are then calculated. 
 On all days that are not monthly index roll days, the notional holdings of each Index Commodity future remains constant. 
 The Index is rebalanced on an annual basis on the sixth Index Business Day of each November. 
 The calculation of the Index is expressed as the weighted average return of the Index Commodities. 
 The Trustee 
 Under the Trust Agreement, Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Trust and the Fund (the Trustee ), has the power and authority to execute and file certificates as required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and to accept service of process on the Fund in the State of Delaware. The Managing Owner has the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Fund. The Trustee will serve in that capacity until such time as the Managing Owner removes the Trustee or the Trustee resigns and a successor is appointed by the Managing Owner. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. 
 The Managing Owner 
 The Managing Owner was formed on February 7, 2003. The Managing Owner is an affiliate of Invesco Ltd. The Managing Owner was formed to be the managing owner of investment vehicles such as ETFs and has been managing non-commodity futures based ETFs since 2003 and commodity futures based ETFs since 2014. The Managing Owner serves as the commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund. The Managing Owner is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the CFTC and is a member of, and approved as a swap firm by, the National Futures Association (the NFA ). As a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, with respect to the Fund, the Managing Owner must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the CFTC and the NFA, including investor protection requirements, antifraud prohibitions, disclosure requirements, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Managing Owner also is subject to periodic inspections and audits by the CFTC and NFA. 
 The Managing Owner s main business offices are located at 3500 Lacey Road, Suite 700, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, and its telephone number is (800) 983-0903. 
 The Fund pays the Managing Owner the Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.75 per annum of the daily net asset value NAV of the Fund. 
 The Fund may, for margin and/or cash management purposes, invest in money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs that are managed by affiliates of the Managing Owner. The indirect portion of the management fee that the Fund may incur through such investment is in addition to the Management Fee paid to the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has contractually agreed to waive indefinitely the fees that it receives in an amount equal to the indirect management fees that the Fund incurs through its investments in affiliated money market mutual funds and/or affiliated T-Bill ETFs. The Managing Owner may terminate this fee waiver on 60 days notice. 
 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Fund will indemnify the Managing Owner against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities on behalf of the Fund, except for any expenses resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct.

The Commodity Broker 
 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the Fund s futures clearing broker (the Commodity Broker ). The Commodity Broker is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant FCM and is a member of the NFA in such capacity. 
 A variety of executing brokers execute futures transactions on behalf of the Fund. Such executing brokers give-up all such transactions to the Commodity Broker. In its capacity as clearing broker, the Commodity Broker may execute or receive transactions executed by others and clears all of the Fund s futures transactions and performs certain administrative and custodial services for the Fund. The Commodity Broker is responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and actions taken by the Fund during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of the Fund. 
 The Fund pays the Commodity Broker all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities. The Commodity Broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. Brokerage commissions and fees in any future fiscal year or any part of any future fiscal year may be greater than fees incurred in prior fiscal years. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker were less than 6.00, 6.00 and 6.00 per round-turn trade 1 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 1 A round-turn trade is a completed transaction involving both a purchase and a liquidating sale, or a sale followed by a covering purchase.

 Tax Reporting 
 The Fund has retained the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to assist with certain tax reporting requirements of the Fund and its Shareholders. 
 Regulation 
 Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC also regulate the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the Managing Owner) to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Managing Owner s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Fund. The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the Managing Owner. If the registration of a managing owner as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the managing owner would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the Fund. The Fund is not registered with the CFTC in any capacity. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires all futures commission merchants, such as the Commodity Broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC. 
 Shareholders are afforded certain rights for reparations under the Commodity Exchange Act. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the Commodity Exchange Act against a floor broker, FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons. 
 Pursuant to authority in the Commodity Exchange Act, the NFA was formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for derivatives professionals. NFA members are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, market integrity, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the derivatives industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of derivatives professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, FCMs, introducing brokers, and swap dealers, among others, and their respective associated persons, as applicable, and floor brokers. The Commodity Broker and the Managing Owner are members of the NFA (the Fund is not required to become a member of the NFA). 
 6 

The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on foreign futures exchanges and markets but permits direct access to such markets from the United States with respect to foreign boards of trade that are registered as such with the CFTC. 
 
 Employees 
 The Fund has no employees.

ITEM 1A. 
 
 RISK FACTORS 

 An investment in Shares involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Report") and the Fund s Prospectus, before making a decision to invest in Shares. If any of the following risks occur, the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Fund may be adversely affected. 
 Summary of Risk Factors 
 Following Russia s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, various countries, including the United States, issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus. Such sanctions, and impacts from the ongoing conflict and related events, may result in increased volatility in the value of Index Commodities, and may have an adverse effect on the performance of the Fund and value of the Shares. 
 Pandemics and other public health emergencies, including the emergence of new coronavirus COVID-19 variants resulting in another pandemic, could disrupt the global economy and adversely affect the Fund s performance. 
 The Fund s trading of futures contracts takes place in very volatile markets and in the past, oil markets have experienced extreme volatility. For example, the WTI futures contract for May 2020 physical delivery reached negative prices on April 20, 2020. If an Index Contract currently held by the Fund, or any other futures contract held by the Fund at a future date, were to reach a negative price, investors in the Fund could lose a significant portion of, or their entire, investment. 
 Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results all or substantially all of an investment in the Fund could be lost. 
 The Fund is subject to fees and expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately 0.77 per annum and will be successful only if its annual returns from futures trading, plus its annual Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, exceed such fees and expenses. 
 The Fund is subject to position limits imposed by the CFTC and/or futures exchange rules. If the Fund were to reach a position limit, its ability to issue new Creation Units or to reinvest income in additional futures contracts may be impaired or limited. This may adversely affect the correlation between the market price of the Shares and the NAV of the Fund, which could result in Shares trading at a premium or discount to the NAV of the Fund. 
 There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve profits or avoid losses, significant or otherwise. 
 Performance of the Fund may not track the Index during particular periods or over the long term. Such tracking error may cause the Fund to outperform or underperform the Index. 
 Disruptions in the ability to create or redeem Creation Units may adversely affect investors. 
 Certain potential conflicts of interest exist between the Managing Owner, the Commodity Broker (as defined herein) and their affiliates and the Fund s shareholders Shareholders ). Although the Managing Owner attempts to monitor for conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Managing Owner to ensure that the conflicts will not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Fund and the Shareholders. 
 The Fund s NAV may not always correspond to the market price of the Shares and, as a result, Shares may trade at prices greater than NAV (at a premium), at NAV, or less than NAV (at a discount). 
 Shareholders will be subject to taxation on their allocable share of the Fund s taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions. 
 Market Risks 
 Fluctuations in the Price of Assets Held by the Fund Could Have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Value of an Investment in Shares. 
 The Shares are designed to reflect as closely as possible the changes, positive or negative, in the level of the Index, over time, through the Fund s portfolio of exchange-traded Index Contracts. The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the portfolio, less the liabilities (including estimated accrued but unpaid expenses) of the Fund. The price of the Index Commodities may fluctuate widely. Several factors may affect the prices of the Index Commodities, including, but not limited to: 

Global supply and demand of each of the Index Commodities, which may be influenced by such factors as forward selling by the various commodities producers, purchases made by the commodities producers to unwind their hedge positions and production and cost levels in the major markets of each of the Index Commodities 

 8 

Domestic and foreign interest rates and investors expectations concerning interest rates 

Domestic and foreign inflation rates and investors expectations concerning inflation rates 

Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, hedge funds and commodity funds 

A significant change in investor interest, including as a result of online campaigns or other activities targeting investments in an Index Commodity 

Weather and other environmental conditions 

Acts of God 

War or acts of terrorism and 

Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. 

 Investing in Oil Markets Has Unique Risk, As Demonstrated in 2020. 
 The oil markets are characterized by extreme volatility. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related price volatility was realized by various sectors of the financial and commodity markets, unusual developments in the crude oil markets occurred. A collapse of demand for fuel following government restrictions on travel created an oversupply of crude oil production that rapidly filled most available oil storage facilities. As a result, in April 2020 crude oil futures contracts traded below zero for the first time in history. Similar storage shortages may occur in the future. The oversupply of oil may arise due to: (i) disruptions in oil pipelines and other means to get oil out of storage and delivered to refineries (as might occur due to infrastructure deterioration, work stoppages, or weather/disaster) (ii) investor demand for futures contracts as an investment opportunity driving increased production or (iii) potential U.S. government intervention (in the form of grants or other aid) to keep oil producers, and the workers they employ, in service. If an Index Contract held by the Fund were to reach a negative price, investors in the Fund could lose a significant portion of, or their entire, investment. 
 Factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and, therefore, its price include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns, including those associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as preferences for electric and alternative-fueled vehicles and remote working and government lockdowns that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Supply-related factors may affect crude oil prices. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent that such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand, and increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil. World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil. 
 NAV May Not Always Correspond to Market Price and, as a Result, Creation Units May Be Created or Redeemed at a Value that Differs from the Market Price of the Shares. 
 Shares may trade at, above or below their NAV. The NAV fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Fund s assets. The trading price of Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV, intraday changes in the value of the Index Contracts and market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price of the Shares relative to their NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca (the exchange on which the Shares trade) and the exchanges on which the Index Contracts are traded. While the Shares are expected to trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time), liquidity in the markets for the Index Contracts is expected to be reduced whenever the principal markets for those contracts are closed. As a result, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on Shares, may widen during these gaps in market trading hours. 
 The NYSE Arca May Halt Trading in the Shares Which Would Adversely Impact Your Ability to Sell Shares. 
 The Shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca. Trading in Shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light of certain procedures and safeguards under NYSE Arca rules. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. If the Fund were no longer to meet the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of its Shares, the Shares would be delisted. In such a scenario, the Fund would be terminated. 
 9 

The Lack of an Active Trading Market for the Shares May Result in Losses on Your Investment at the Time of Disposition of Your Shares. 
 Although the Shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained. If you need to sell your Shares at a time when no active market for them exists, the price you receive for your Shares, assuming that you are able to sell them, likely will be lower than the price you would receive if an active market did exist. 
 Volatility May Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment. 
 Futures contract prices have a high degree of volatility and are subject to rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, there is a risk that the value of your investment in the Fund could decrease significantly due to rapid and substantial changes in the prices of futures contracts held by the Fund. The Index s average annual volatility since inception is 24.89 . Average annual volatility is the average of the Index s volatility each year since its inception. Yearly volatility is the relative rate at which the price of the Index moves up and down, found by calculating the annualized standard deviation of the daily change in price for each business day in the given year. However, annual volatility should not be interpreted as the most-likely outcome. As demonstrated during the unprecedented market conditions in 2020, volatility in certain futures contracts may spike significantly during periods of global economic and social stress. At such times, if the Fund holds a futures contract that experiences the full impact of such market stresses, the volatility of its investments could greatly surpass the Index s annual volatility since inception. 
 In addition, the Fund enters sell orders with the Commodity Broker from time to time to liquidate Index Contract positions in order to satisfy redemption requests or to pay expenses and liabilities. The Fund is subject to the risk that temporary aberrations or distortions will occur in the market for Index Contracts at the time those orders are executed. The prices received by the Fund from the liquidation of its positions could be adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect the value of the Shares. Those aberrations or distortions may result from trading activities by other market participants or actions taken by the Commodity Broker, the CFTC, the exchanges or other regulatory authorities. If the Fund s positions are liquidated at inopportune times or during times when the market is temporarily distorted or otherwise experiencing a pricing aberration, the value of the Shares may be adversely affected. 
 Further, in periods of heightened volatility, the bid and ask spread for purchasing shares of the Fund typically widen. Accordingly, an investor s return on investment may be negatively impacted when transacted in Shares. 
 The Fund s Trading of Index Contracts May Adversely Affect the Price that the Fund Pays for Index Contracts. 
 The prices that the Fund pays for Index Contracts may be adversely affected by the trading of Index Contracts by other market participants. Transactions by other market participants may be based on their awareness of the Fund s positions in Index Contracts. If other market participants are able to anticipate the timing of the Fund s Index Contract transactions, for instance, they may be able to execute transactions in advance of the Fund. If that were to occur, those market participants may receive more favorable pricing for their Index Contract transactions than the Fund does for its own, subsequent Index Contract transactions. If the Fund s Index Contract positions represent a significant part of the open long interest in those Index Contracts, moreover, other market participants may take that fact into account and trade in a manner that adversely affects the prices that the Fund obtains when trading Index Contracts. The Fund may not be able to counteract adverse pricing effects of its own positions and transactions in Index Contracts. 
 Withdrawal from Participation by Authorized Participants May Affect the Liquidity of Shares. 
 If one or more Authorized Participants withdraws from participation, it may become more difficult to create or redeem Creation Units, which may reduce the liquidity of the Shares. Such circumstances may be more pronounced in market conditions of increased volatility. If it becomes more difficult to create or redeem Creation Units, the correlation between the price of the Shares and the NAV may be affected, which may affect the trading market for the Shares. Having fewer participants in the market for the Shares could also adversely affect the ability to arbitrage any price difference between futures contracts and the Shares, which may also affect the trading market and liquidity of the Shares. 
 Possible Illiquid Markets May Exacerbate Losses. 
 Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as when foreign governments may take or be subject to political actions which disrupt the markets in their currencies or major commodities exports, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. 
 Illiquidity may cause losses for the Fund. The large size of the positions which the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making its positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. 
 10 

Trading on Futures Exchanges Outside the United States Is Not Subject to U.S. Regulation. 
 Trading on futures exchanges located outside the United States is not regulated by any United States governmental agency and may involve certain risks not applicable to trading on U.S. exchanges, including different or diminished investor protections. If the Fund trades contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Fund will be exposed to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the currencies in which those contracts are denominated. 
 In addition, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability, among other factors. An adverse development with respect to any of these factors could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on the Fund s trades on non-U.S. exchanges. 
 Risk that Russia s Invasion of Ukraine May Result in Market Volatility that Could Adversely Affect the Fund s Performance. 
 Following Russia s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, various countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Japan, as well as NATO and the European Union, issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus. The resulting sanctions (and potential further sanctions in response to continued military activity), the potential for military escalation and other corresponding events, have had, and could continue to have, severe negative effects on regional and global economic and financial markets, including increased volatility, reduced liquidity and overall uncertainty. The negative impacts may be particularly acute in certain sectors. Russia may take additional counter measures or retaliatory actions (including cyberattacks), which could exacerbate negative consequences on global financial markets. The duration of ongoing hostilities and corresponding sanctions and related events cannot be predicted. Impacts from the conflict and related events may result in increased volatility in the value of Index Commodities and may have an adverse effect on the performance of the Fund and value of the Shares. 
 Pandemics and other public health emergencies, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, could disrupt the global economy and adversely impact the Fund s performance. 
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was extensive in many aspects of society. The outbreak resulted in a significant number of deaths, adversely impacted global commercial activity, and led to significant uncertainty and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets. Many countries reacted by instituting quarantines, prohibitions on travel and the closure of offices, businesses, schools, retail stores and other public venues. Businesses also implemented similar precautionary measures. While restrictions have started to ease in areas around the world, they may be reinstated in the future. Such measures, as well as the general uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19, including new variants and mutations of the virus, created significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity. Consumer, corporate and financial confidence was materially adversely affected by the outbreak. Such erosion of confidence may lead to or extend to a localized or global economic downturn. Future pandemics and other public health emergencies could exacerbate political, social, and economic risks and result in significant breakdowns, delays, and other disruptions to the economy, with potential corresponding results on the performance of the Fund and its investments. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in certain governmental interventions that were implemented on an emergency basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. No assurances can be made regarding the policies that may be adopted by the Federal Reserve, the federal government (including regulatory agencies), any state government, or any foreign government as a result of additional or new outbreak s and other public health emergencies or market volatility. 
 The Effect of Market Disruptions and Government Interventions Are Unpredictable and May Have an Adverse Effect on the Value of Your Shares. 
 The commodity futures markets may be subject to temporary distortions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, congestion, disorderly closing periods, manipulation and disruptive conduct, limitations on deliverable supplies, excessive speculation, government regulation and intervention, technical and operational or system failures, nuclear accidents, terrorism, riots and acts of God. 
 Government intervention has in certain cases been implemented on an emergency basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. These interventions have typically been unclear in scope and application, resulting in confusion and uncertainty which in itself has been materially detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets as well as previously successful investment strategies. 
 The financial crisis of 2008-2009 and associated regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), are generally considered to have contributed to less credit being available to financial market participants. This is particularly the case for credit extended by banks and other traditional lending sources. The Fund does not borrow from lenders for the purpose of pursuing its investment objective. Nonetheless, restrictions on the availability of credit may adversely affect investors who borrow to purchase Shares and participants in the markets for financial instruments in which 
 11 

the Fund trades, including futures markets. Limitations on the availability of credit, whether in stressed market conditions or otherwise, may have a material adverse effect on investors and financial market participants, which in turn could affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. Among other things, fewer prospective investors may adversely affect the Fund s asset levels, and fewer financial market participants may reduce liquidity and adversely affect pricing for the financial instruments that the Fund seeks to trade. 
 The Fund may incur major losses in the event of disrupted markets and other extraordinary events in which historical pricing relationships become materially distorted. The risk of loss from pricing distortions is compounded by the fact that in disrupted markets many positions become illiquid, making it difficult or impossible to close out or liquidate positions against which the markets are moving. The large size of the positions which the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making its positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. 
 An Investment in the Shares May Be Adversely Affected by Competition from Other Methods of Investing in Commodities. 
 The Fund competes with other financial vehicles, including mutual funds, ETFs and other investment companies, other index tracking commodity pools, actively traded commodity pools, hedge funds, traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the commodities industry, other securities backed by or linked to commodities, and direct investments in the underlying commodities or commodity futures contracts. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Managing Owner s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in such commodities directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and therefore reduce the liquidity of the Shares. 
 The NAV Calculation of the Fund May Be Overstated or Understated Due to the Valuation Method Employed When a Settlement Price Is Not Available on the Date of NAV Calculation. 
 Calculating the NAV of the Fund includes, in part, any unrealized profits or losses on open commodity futures contracts. Under normal circumstances, the NAV of the Fund reflects the settlement price of open commodity futures contracts on the date when the NAV is being calculated. However, if a settlement price for a commodity futures contract could not be determined for any reason, the Managing Owner may value the futures contract pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted. In such a situation, there is a risk that the resulting calculation of the Fund s NAV could be understated or overstated, perhaps to a significant degree. 
 Fund Closures and Trading Halts may Impact the Price of Shares. 
 Extraordinary market circumstances may result in other exchange traded products that provide their investors with exposure to certain commodities having to liquidate or temporarily halt issuing creation units. Outflows or liquidations in other commodity pooled investment vehicles that provide exposure to the same commodities to which the Fund is exposed may result in downward price pressure on the related futures contracts as the commodity pools liquidate positions. 
 Futures Risks 
 Margin Requirements and Risk Limits for Futures Contracts may Limit the Fund s Ability to Achieve Sufficient Exposure and Prevent the Fund from Achieving its Investment Objective. 
 Initial or original margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a futures trader with his commodity broker in order to initiate futures trading or to maintain an open position in futures contracts. Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than initial margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the futures trader s performance of the futures contract that the trader purchases or sells. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 2 of the purchase price of the underlying commodity being traded. Because of such low margins, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that are greater, in relation to the amount invested, than are customary in other forms of investments. The minimum amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which such contract is traded, and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. With respect to the Managing Owner s trading, only the Managing Owner, and not the Fund or its Shareholders personally, will be subject to margin calls. 
 Brokerage firms carrying accounts for traders in futures contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy in order to afford further protection for themselves. 
 An FCM may compute margin requirements multiple times per day and must do so at least once per day. When the Fund has an open futures contract position, it is subject to daily variation margin calls by an FCM that could be substantial in the event of adverse price movements. Because futures contracts require only a small initial investment in the form of a deposit or initial margin, they involve a high degree of leverage. A Fund with open positions is subject to maintenance or variation margin on its open positions. 
 12 

When the market value of a particular open futures contract position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the FCM. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the FCM may close out the Fund s position, which may result in reduced returns to the Fund s investors or impair the Fund from achieving its investment objective. If the Fund has insufficient cash to meet daily variation margin requirements, it may need to sell assets at a time when doing so is disadvantageous. Futures markets are highly volatile in general, and may become more volatile during periods of market or economic volatility, and the use of or exposure to futures contracts may increase volatility of the Fund s NAV. 
 In addition, an FCM may impose margin requirements in addition to those imposed by the clearinghouse. Margin requirements are subject to change on any given day, and may be raised in the future on a single day or on multiple or successive days by either or both of the clearinghouse and the FCM. High margin requirements could prevent the Fund from obtaining sufficient exposure to futures contracts and may adversely affect the Fund s ability to achieve its investment objective. An FCM s failure to return required margin to the Fund on a timely basis may cause the Fund to delay redemption settlement dates or restrict, postpone, or limit the right of redemption. 
 Futures contracts are subject to liquidity risk. An FCM may impose risk limits on the Fund, which restrict the amount of exposure to futures contracts that the Fund can obtain through the FCM. If the risk limits imposed by an FCM do not provide sufficient exposure, the Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective. 
 Trading Limitations Could Be Imposed on the Fund. 
 Market volatility and economic turbulence that occurred in 2020 led to FCMs increasing margin requirements for certain futures contracts. Some FCMs may impose trading limitations, whether in the form of limits or prohibitions on trading certain futures contracts. If the Fund is subject to increased margin requirements, it will incur increased costs in achieving its investment objective. The Fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective if it becomes subject to heightened trading limitations. 
 Because the Index Contracts Have No Intrinsic Value, the Positive Performance of Your Investment Is Wholly Dependent Upon an Equal and Offsetting Loss. 
 Trading in futures contracts transfers the risk of future price movements from one market participant to another. For every gain in futures trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. Accordingly, whether a futures trade is profitable for one party depends on whether the price paid, value received, or cost of delivery under the related futures contract is favorable to that party. The prices of stocks, bonds, and other assets could rise significantly and the economy as a whole could prosper while the Fund experiences losses as a result of pursuing its investment objective through trading Index Contracts. 
 The Fund May Not Provide a Diversification Benefit to Investments in Other Asset Classes and May Result in Additional Losses to Your Portfolio. 
 Historically, commodity futures returns have tended not to be correlated with the returns of other assets such as stocks and bonds. Commodity futures contracts therefore have the potential to help diversify investor portfolios consisting of stocks and bonds, to the extent there is low or negative correlation between commodity futures contracts and other assets held in those portfolios. However, the fact that the Index is not inversely correlated with other assets such as stocks and bonds means that, in seeking to replicate the performance of the Index, the Fund will not necessarily be profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock or bond markets. If the Shares perform in a manner that correlates with the stock or bond markets or otherwise do not perform successfully, the Shares may not provide any diversification from losses in those markets. In such a scenario, the Shares may produce no gains to offset losses from investments in stocks, bonds, or related assets and may result in additional investment losses . 
 The Fund s Returns from Futures Trading Will Be Affected by Market Conditions When Replacing Expiring Futures Contracts with New Futures Contracts on Index Commodities. 
 The Fund s returns from futures trading are called excess return, which is the combined return based on the spot prices of Index Commodities and the roll yield from trading Index Contracts. Market conditions at the time the Fund replaces expiring Index Contracts with new Index Contracts i.e., when Index Contracts are rolled will affect the Fund s roll yield. Those market conditions are referred to as backwardation and contango, which will generally affect the Fund s roll yield as set forth below: 
 Rolling in a backwardated market will tend to enhance returns from futures trading. Backwardation exists when prices are higher for contracts with shorter-term expirations than those with longer-term expirations, a condition that is typically associated with commodities that are consumed quickly instead of being put in storage. 
 Rolling in a contangoed market will tend to cause a drag on returns from futures trading. Contango exists when contract prices are higher in distant delivery months than in nearer delivery months, typically due to costs associated with storing a given physical commodity for a longer period. 
 13 

In seeking to track the performance of the Index, therefore, the Fund will be exposed to the effects of backwardation and contango when it rolls its positions in Index Contracts. The Index uses the Optimum Yield TM rolling methodology, which seeks to maximize the roll benefits in backwardated markets and to minimize the losses from rolling in contangoed markets. There can be no assurance that these outcomes will be obtained. The impact of backwardation and contango may also cause the Fund s performance to vary from the returns of other price references, including the spot prices of one or more Index Commodities. 
 Super contango exists when the futures contracts for the month next to occur (e.g., the April 2023 futures contract available in March 2023) trade significantly lower than futures contracts with delivery in later months. Super contango typically occurs when the inventory space available to store the physical commodity has significantly decreased as a result of excess supply, meaning that a futures contract s cost of carry (e.g., the cost of storing a physical commodity) has increased. The effects of rolling in a super contangoed market generally are more exaggerated than rolling in a contangoed market. Should an Index Contract experience super contango (as occurred for the May 2020 WTI futures contract in late April 2020), the drag on returns may be exacerbated and ripple effects may impact the performance of futures contracts with later delivery months. 
 Index Risks 
 The Fund s Performance May Not Always Replicate the Changes in the Levels of its Index. 
 Tracking the Index requires trading of the Fund's portfolio with a view to tracking the Index over time and is dependent upon the skills of the Managing Owner and its trading principals, among other factors. It is possible that the Fund s performance may not fully replicate the changes in levels of the Index due to disruptions in the markets for the relevant Index Commodities, the imposition of position limits, or due to other extraordinary circumstances. 
 The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical, including in scenarios wherein the futures market is thinly traded, or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 In addition, the Fund may not be able to replicate the changes in levels of the Index because the total return generated by the Fund is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with the Fund s trading activities, and increased by, as applicable, Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income. 
 There can be no guarantee that the Index or the underlying methodology is free from error. It is also possible that third parties may seek to manipulate the value of the Index or the Index Commodities which, if successful, would be likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund s performance. 
 The Fund Is Not Actively Managed and Tracks the Index During Periods in Which the Index Is Flat or Declining as well as When the Index Is Rising. 
 The Fund is not actively managed on the basis of judgments relating to economic, financial and market conditions with a view to obtaining positive results under all market conditions. Instead, the Managing Owner seeks to cause the NAV to track the performance of the Index during periods in which the Index is flat or declining as well as when the Index is rising. Therefore, if positions in any one or more of the Index Commodities are declining in value, the Fund will not close out such positions, except in connection with a change in the composition or weighting of the Index. 
 Fewer Representative Commodities May Result in Greater Index Volatility. 
 The Index Commodities are RBOB Gasoline, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel, Brent Crude Oil, Light Sweet Crude Oil, and Natural Gas. Other commodity indexes may contain a larger number of commodities than the Index. Accordingly, increased volatility in a single Index Commodity is expected to have a greater impact on the Index s overall volatility than would likely be the case with increased volatility in a single commodity within a broader index. Because the Fund tracks the performance of the Index, your investment in the Fund will be exposed to the relatively greater impact on the Index of volatility in a single Index Commodity. 
 14 

Unusually Long Peak-to-Valley Drawdown Periods with Respect To the Index May Be Reflected in Equally Long Peak-to-Valley Drawdown Periods with Respect to the Performance of the Shares. 
 Peak-to-valley drawdown represents the cumulative percentage decline in month-end NAV per Share due to losses sustained during any period in which the initial month-end NAV per Share is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end NAV per Share. 
 Although past Index levels are not necessarily indicative of future Index levels, the peak-to-valley drawdown periods that the Index has experienced occasionally have been unusually long and have lasted for multi-year drawdown periods. 
 Because it is expected that the Fund s performance will track the change of its underlying Index, the Fund would experience a continuous drawdown during the period that the Index experiences such a drawdown. The value of your Shares will also decrease during such a period. 
 Regulatory Risks 
 Position Limits and Other Potential Limitations on Futures Trading May Restrict the Creation of Creation Units and the Operation of the Fund. 
 Position Limits . CFTC and futures exchange rules impose position limits on market participants, including the Fund, trading in certain commodity futures contracts. These position limits prohibit any person from holding a position of more than a specific number of futures contracts. Generally, position limits in the physical delivery markets are set at a stricter level during the spot month, which is the month when the futures contract matures and becomes deliverable, versus the limits for any other month or for all months combined. Limits are generally applied on an aggregate basis to positions held in accounts that are subject to 10 or greater common ownership or control. In December 2016, the CFTC adopted rule amendments that provide exemptions from the general requirement to aggregate all positions that are held pursuant to 10 or greater common ownership or control. 
 The Index is composed of five Index Commodities, which are all subject to position limits imposed by the rules of the CFTC and/or futures exchanges on which the futures contracts for the applicable Index Commodities are traded. The CFTC amended its position limits rules in October 2020. Pursuant to the amended rules, federal position limits apply to 25 physical delivery commodity futures contracts and options thereon, as well as to swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts and to futures and options thereon that are directly or indirectly linked to the price of such contracts or to the same commodity underlying such contracts (e.g., cash-settled look-a-like futures). Under the amended framework, position limits (i) for 25 core referenced futures contracts (including corn, oats, wheat, soybean, soybean meal, soybean oil, cotton, live cattle, rough rice, cocoa, coffee, frozen orange juice concentrate, sugar, gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium, natural gas, crude oil, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel, and RBOB gasoline) are determined by the CFTC and (ii) for all other commodities are determined by the futures exchanges. 
 Futures exchanges have the authority to amend their existing position limits rules or adopt new requirements subject to the federal limits. New or more restrictive position limits could reduce liquidity in the market, which would be likely to have adverse effects on the pricing of commodity futures contracts. Changes in CFTC and/or exchange-level position limits rules therefore could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective or achieve favorable performance. 
 Position Aggregation . In general, a trader is required by CFTC or exchange rules, as applicable, to aggregate all positions in accounts as to which the trader has 10 or greater ownership or control. CFTC and exchange rules provide exemptions from this requirement. For example, a trader is not required to aggregate positions in multiple accounts that it owns or controls if that trader is able to satisfy the requirements of an exemption from aggregation of those accounts, including, where available, the independent account controller exemption. 
 Failure to comply with the independent account controller exemption or another exemption from the aggregation requirement could obligate the Managing Owner to aggregate positions in multiple accounts under its control, which could include the Fund and other commodity pools or accounts under the Managing Owner s control. In such a scenario, the Fund may not be able to obtain exposure to one or more Index Contracts necessary to pursue its investment objective, or it may be required to liquidate existing Index Contract positions in order to comply with a limit. Such an outcome could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective or achieve favorable performance. 
 The CFTC amended its position aggregation rules in December 2016. The CFTC staff subsequently issued time-limited no-action relief from compliance with certain requirements under the amended aggregation rules, including the general requirement to aggregate positions in the same commodity futures contracts traded pursuant to substantially identical trading strategies. This no-action relief expires on August 12, 2025.

Since coming into effect on January 3, 2018, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II MiFID II ), as implemented in national laws and regulations, requires the competent authorities of member states in the European Union EU and United Kingdom UK to impose position limits on certain commodity derivatives contracts which are applicable to any person, whether or not based in the EU or UK. Pursuant to laws and regulations that implemented MiFID II in the UK, the UK regulatory agency, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), has established position limits applicable to aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc commodity derivative contracts traded on the London Metal Exchange LME ). LME may also impose accountability levels in certain contracts, where further directions in respect of those positions can then be required. If the Fund were to trade commodity derivatives contracts on other exchanges in the EU or the UK, position limits may apply to such trading activity pursuant to MiFID II as implemented in the relevant national laws and regulations. On January 31, 2020, the UK formally withdrew from the EU (known as Brexit and, after a transition period, left the EU single market and customs union under the terms of a new trade agreement on December 31, 2020. The agreement governs the new relationship between the UK and EU with respect to trading goods and services, but critical aspects of the relationship remain unresolved and subject to further negotiation and agreement. The complete impact of the new agreement, as well as the full scope and nature of the consequences of the exit, are not at this time known and are unlikely to be known for a significant period of time. Any UK firm that was trading derivatives in EU markets using a MiFID passport prior to the conclusion of the transition period will no longer be able to use that MiFID II passport to do so and instead would need to look to any MiFID II third country regime to access the EU market or establish a MiFID II compliant EU branch or subsidiary. The loss of MiFID II passports by UK-based firms could adversely affect the Fund s ability to trade derivatives in EU markets through UK-based firms. 
 Accountability Levels . Exchanges may establish accountability levels applicable to futures contracts instead of position limits, provided that the futures contract is not subject to federal position limits. An exchange may order a person who holds or controls a position in excess of a position accountability level not to further increase its position, to comply with any prospective limit that exceeds the size of the position owned or controlled, or to reduce any open position that exceeds the position accountability level if the exchange determines that such action is necessary to maintain an orderly market. Position accountability levels could adversely affect the Fund s ability to establish and maintain positions in commodity futures contracts to which such levels apply, if the Fund were to trade in such contracts. Such an outcome could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. 
 Daily Limits. U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits, and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a limit price . Once a limit price has been reached in a particular contract, it is usually the case that no trades may be made at a different price than specified in the limit. The duration of limit prices generally varies. Limit prices may have the effect of precluding the Fund from trading in a particular contract or requiring the Fund to liquidate contracts at disadvantageous times or prices. Either of those outcomes could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. 
 Potential Effects of Positions Limits, Accountability Levels, and Daily Limits. The Fund is currently subject to position limits and may be subject to new and more restrictive position limits in the future. If the Fund reached a position limit or accountability level or became subject to a daily limit, its ability to issue new Creation Units or reinvest income in additional commodity futures contracts may be limited to the extent these restrictions limit its ability to establish new futures positions, add to existing positions, or otherwise transact in futures. Limiting the size of the Fund, or restricting the Fund s futures trading, under these requirements could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective. 
 Failure of Futures Commission Merchants or Commodity Brokers to Segregate Assets May Cause Losses for the Fund. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all funds received from customers from such FCM s proprietary assets. If the Commodity Broker fails to segregate customer assets as required, the assets of the Fund might not be fully protected in the event of the Commodity Broker s bankruptcy. Furthermore, in the event of the Commodity Broker s bankruptcy, the Fund could be limited to recovering either a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the Commodity Broker s combined customer accounts or the Fund may not recover any assets at all, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Fund was held by the Commodity Broker. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires an approved derivatives clearing organization to segregate all funds and other property received from a clearing member s customers in connection with U.S. futures and options contracts from any funds held at the clearing organization to support the clearing member s proprietary trading. Nevertheless, customer funds held at a clearing organization in connection with any futures or options contracts may be held in a commingled omnibus account, which may not identify the name of the clearing member s individual customers. With respect to futures and options contracts, a clearing organization may use assets of a non-defaulting customer held in an omnibus account at the clearing organization to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member to the clearing organization. In the event of a default of the clearing FCM s other clients or the clearing FCM s failure to extend its own funds in connection with any such default, a customer may not be able to recover the full amount of assets deposited by the clearing FCM with the clearing organization on the customer s behalf. 
 16 

In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of any exchange or a clearing house, the Fund could experience a loss of the funds deposited through the Commodity Broker as margin with the exchange or clearing house, a loss of any unrealized profits on its open positions on the exchange, and the loss of unrealized profits on its closed positions on the exchange. 
 The Fund s Performance Could Be Adversely Affected if the Commodity Broker Reduces its Internal Risk Limits for the Fund. 
 The CFTC requires FCMs, like the Commodity Broker, to implement and evaluate from time-to-time risk-based limits on futures position and order sizes. Under this regime, the Commodity Broker could determine to reduce its internal risk limits on the size of futures positions it will trade or clear for the Fund. Such a development would reduce the Fund s capacity to transact in futures contracts. In this scenario, the Fund could seek to enter into clearing relationships with one or more other clearing brokers with the goal of increasing its overall capacity to trade and clear futures contracts. The introduction of one or more additional clearing broker relationships would be likely to increase the Fund s trading costs and could make its overall trading less efficient or more prone to error. These consequences would be likely to detract from the Fund s performance. 
 Regulatory Changes or Actions May Alter the Operations and Profitability of the Fund. 
 The regulation of commodity interest transactions and markets, including under the Dodd-Frank Act, is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act has expanded the regulation of markets, market participants and financial instruments. The regulatory regime under the Dodd-Frank Act has imposed additional compliance and legal burdens on participants in the markets for futures and other commodity interests. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act new capital and risk requirements have been imposed on market intermediaries. Those requirements may cause the cost of trading to increase for market participants, like the Fund, that must interact with those intermediaries to carry out their trading activities. These increased costs can detract from the Fund s performance. 
 The Fund and the Managing Owner Are Subject to Extensive Legal and Regulatory Requirements. 
 The Fund is subject to a comprehensive scheme of regulation under the federal commodity futures trading and securities laws, as well as futures market rules and the rules and listing standards for its Shares. The Fund and the Managing Owner could each be subject to sanctions for a failure to comply with those requirements, which could adversely affect the Fund s financial performance and its ability to pursue its investment objective. In addition, the SEC, CFTC, and exchanges are empowered to intervene in their respective markets in response to extreme market conditions. Any such interventions could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective and could lead to losses for the Fund and its Shareholders. 
 In addition, the Fund is subject to significant disclosure, internal control, governance, and financial reporting requirements because the Shares are publicly traded. 
 For example, the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Under this requirement, the Fund must adopt, implement and maintain an internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. The Fund is also required to adopt, implement, and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by the Fund in reports that it files or submits to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. There is a risk that the Fund s internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could fail to work properly or otherwise fail to satisfy SEC requirements. Such a failure could result in the reporting or disclosure of incorrect information or a failure to report information on a timely basis. Such a failure could be to the disadvantage of Shareholders and could expose the Fund to penalties or otherwise adversely affect the Fund s status under the federal securities laws and SEC regulations. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and other disclosure matters. 
 Tax Risks 
 Shareholders Will Be Subject to Taxation on Their Allocable Share of the Fund s Taxable Income, Whether or Not They Receive Cash Distributions. 
 Shareholders will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income taxation on their allocable share of the Fund s taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from the Fund. Shareholders may not receive cash distributions equal to their share of the Fund s taxable income or even the tax liability that results from such income. 
 17 

Items of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction with Respect to Shares Could Be Reallocated if the IRS Does Not Accept the Assumptions or Conventions Used by the Fund in Allocating Such Items. 
 U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to partnerships are complex and often difficult to apply to publicly traded partnerships. The Fund will apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report items of income, gain, loss and deduction to Shareholders in a manner that reflects the Shareholders beneficial interest in such tax items, but these assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of the applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS will successfully assert that the conventions and assumptions used by the Fund do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and/or the Federal Tax Regulations codified under 26 C.F.R., referred to herein as the Treasury Regulations, and could require that items of income, gain, loss and deduction be adjusted or reallocated in a manner that adversely affects one or more Shareholders. 
 The Fund is a partnership, which is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Rather, the partnership's taxable income flows through to the owners, who are responsible for paying the applicable income taxes on the income allocated to them. The Fund is subject to partnership audit rules in Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code (the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime ). Under the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime, any IRS audit of the Fund would be conducted at the Fund level, and if the IRS determines an adjustment, the default rule is that the Fund would pay an imputed underpayment including interest and penalties, if applicable. The Fund may instead elect to make a push-out election, in which case the shareholders for the year that is under audit would be required to take into account the adjustments on their own personal income tax returns. 
 No Deduction for Qualified Publicly Traded Partnership Income. 
 For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026, there is a 20 deduction for qualified publicly traded partnership income within the meaning of Section 199A(e)(4) of the Code. In general, qualified publicly traded partnership income for this purpose is an item of income, gain, deduction or loss that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business and includable in determining taxable income for the year but does not include certain investment income. It is currently not expected that the Fund s income will be eligible for such deduction because, as discussed below, although the matter is not free from doubt, the Fund believes that the activities directly conducted by the Fund will not result in the Fund being engaged in a trade or business within the United States. Potential investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of such deduction for their allocable share of the Fund s items of income, gain, deduction and loss. 
 PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AND COUNSEL WITH RESPECT TO THE POSSIBLE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES SUCH TAX CONSEQUENCES MAY DIFFER WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT INVESTORS. 
 General Risks 
 An Insolvency Resulting From Another Series in the Trust or the Trust Itself May Have a Material Adverse Effect On the Fund. 
 The Fund is a series of a Delaware statutory trust. Pursuant to Delaware law, the organization of the Trust provides that the assets and liabilities of the Fund are separate from the assets and liabilities of the other series of the Trust, as well as the larger Trust itself. Though such organization may, under state law, protect the assets of the Fund in an insolvency action brought by the creditors of another series of the Trust, this may be insufficient to protect the assets of the Fund from such creditors in an insolvency action in Federal court, or in a court in a foreign jurisdiction. Accordingly, an insolvency resulting from another series in the Trust or the Trust itself may have a material adverse effect on the Fund. 
 Disruptions in the Ability to Create and Redeem Creation Units May Adversely Affect Investors. 
 It is generally expected that the public trading price per Share will track the NAV per Share closely over time. The relationship between the public trading price per Share and the NAV per Share depends, to a considerable degree, on the ability of Authorized Participants or their clients or customers to purchase and redeem Creation Units in the ordinary course. If the process for creating or redeeming Shares is impaired for any reason, Authorized Participants and their clients or customers may not be able to purchase and redeem Creation Units or, even if possible, may choose not to do so. The inability to purchase and redeem Creation Units, or the partial impairment of the ability to purchase and redeem Creation Units, could result in Shares trading at a premium or discount to the NAV of the Fund. Such a premium or discount could be significant, depending upon the nature or duration of the impairment 
 In addition, the Fund may, in its discretion, suspend the creation of Creation Units. Suspension of creations may adversely affect how the Shares are traded and could cause Shares to trade at a premium or discount to the NAV of the Fund, perhaps to a significant degree. 
 
 18 

The Shares Could Decrease in Value if Unanticipated Operational or Trading Problems Arise. 
 The mechanisms and procedures governing the creation, redemption and offering of the Shares have been developed specifically for the Fund. Consequently, there may be unanticipated problems with respect to the mechanics of the operations of the Fund and the trading of the Shares that could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. To the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems arise, the Managing Owner s past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving those problems. 
 Historical Performance of the Fund and the Index Is Not Indicative of Future Performance. 
 Past performance of the Fund or the Index is not necessarily indicative of future results. Therefore, past performance of the Fund or the Index should not be relied upon in deciding whether to buy Shares of the Fund. 
 Fees and Expenses May Deplete the Fund s Assets if the Fund s Investment Performance Is Not Favorable. 
 The Fund pays fees and expenses regardless of its investment performance. Such fees and expenses include asset-based fees of 0.75 per annum. Additional charges include brokerage fees of approximately 0.02 per annum in the aggregate and selling commissions. Selling commissions are not included in the Fund s breakeven calculation. The sum of the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and/or T-Bill ETF Income may not exceed its fees and expenses. If such income does not exceed its fees and expenses, in order to break even, the Fund s futures trading activity will need to have a favorable performance that exceeds the difference between the sum of the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and/or T-Bill ETF Income and its fees and expenses. If the Fund s futures trading performance is not sufficiently favorable, the Fund s expenses could deplete its assets over time. In such a scenario, the value of your Shares will decrease. 
 There May Be Circumstances That Could Prevent the Fund from Being Operated in a Manner Consistent with its Investment Objective . 
 There may be circumstances outside the control of the Managing Owner and/or the Fund that make it, for all practical purposes, impossible to re-position the Fund and/or to process a purchase or redemption order. Examples of such circumstances include: natural disasters public service disruptions or utility problems such as those caused by fires, floods, extreme weather conditions, and power outages resulting in telephone, telecopy, and computer failures market conditions or activities causing trading halts systems failures involving computer or other information systems affecting the aforementioned parties, as well as DTC, or any other participant in the purchase process, and similar extraordinary events. While the Managing Owner has established and implemented a disaster recovery plan, circumstances such as those identified above may prevent the Fund from being operated in a manner consistent with its investment objective. 
 Additionally, natural or environmental disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally, and widespread disease, including pandemics and epidemics, have been and may be highly disruptive to economies and markets, adversely impacting individual companies, sectors, industries, markets, currencies, interest and inflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the Fund s investments. Given the increasing interdependence among global economies and markets, conditions in one country, market, or region are increasingly likely to adversely affect markets, issuers, and/or foreign exchange rates in other countries, including the U.S. Any such events could have a significant adverse impact on the value of the Fund s investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund s NAV. Additionally, the Fund rebalances its portfolio in accordance with the Index, and, therefore, any changes to the Index s rebalance schedule will result in corresponding changes to the Fund s rebalance schedule. 
 Redemption Orders for Creation Units May Be Subject to Postponement, Suspension or Rejection Under Certain Circumstances. 
 The Managing Owner may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption order settlement date with respect to Creation Units for (1) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the redemption distribution is not reasonably practicable, or (2) such other period as the Managing Owner determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders. In addition, the Fund will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the participant agreement with the Authorized Participant, or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of the Fund s counsel, might be unlawful. Any such postponement, suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Authorized Participant. For example, the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the Authorized Participant s redemption proceeds if the NAV of the Fund declines during the period of delay. The Fund disclaims any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 
 
 19 

Shareholders Do Not Have the Protections Associated with Ownership of Shares in an Investment Company Registered Under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
 The Fund is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the legal and regulatory protections provided to the investors in investment companies that are registered as such. 
 Shareholders Do Not Have the Rights Enjoyed by Investors in Certain Other Vehicles. 
 The Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation. However, under Delaware law, a beneficial owner of a business trust (such as a Shareholder) may, under certain circumstances, institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated beneficial owners to recover damages from a third party where a managing owner has failed or refused to institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated beneficial owners to recover damages from a managing owner for violations of fiduciary duties, or on behalf of a business trust to recover damages from a third party where a managing owner has failed or refused to institute proceedings to recover such damages. The Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and the Fund is not required to pay regular distributions, although the Fund may pay distributions in the discretion of the Managing Owner). 
 Various Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest May Be Detrimental to Shareholders. 
 The Fund is subject to actual and potential conflicts of interest involving the Managing Owner or any of its affiliates, the Commodity Broker, including its principals and its affiliates, the Index Sponsor and the Distributor. The Managing Owner and its principals, all of whom are engaged in other investment activities, are not required to devote substantially all of their time to the business of the Fund, which also presents the potential for numerous conflicts of interest with the Fund. The Managing Owner and its principals and affiliates are engaged in a broad array of asset management and financial services activities and may engage in activities during the ordinary course of business that cause their interests or those of their other clients to conflict with those of the Fund and its Shareholders. 
 As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the Fund and the Shareholders. For example, by investing in affiliated money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs for margin and/or cash management purposes, the Managing Owner may select affiliated money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs that may pay dividends that are lower than non-affiliated money market mutual funds and/or T-Bill ETFs. In addition, the Managing Owner would have a conflict of interest if it sought to redeem the Fund s interest in an affiliated money market mutual fund or T-Bill ETF in circumstances when such a redemption would be unfavorable for the affiliated fund. The Managing Owner has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Managing Owner attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Managing Owner to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Fund and the Shareholders. 
 The Fund may be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the Commodity Broker, including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the Commodity Broker. 
 Because the Managing Owner and the Distributor are affiliates, the Managing Owner has a disincentive to replace the Distributor. Furthermore, the Managing Owner did not conduct an arm s length negotiation when it retained the Distributor. 
 Lack of Independent Advisers Representing Investors. 
 The Managing Owner has consulted with counsel, accountants and other advisers regarding the operation of the Fund. No counsel has been appointed to represent you in connection with the Fund s continuous offering of Shares. Accordingly, you should consult your own legal, tax and financial advisers about whether you should invest in the Fund. 
 Possibility of Termination of the Fund May Adversely Affect Your Portfolio. 
 It is ultimately within the discretion of the Managing Owner whether it will continue to operate and advise the Fund. The Managing Owner may withdraw from the Fund upon 120 days prior written notice to all Shareholders and the Trustee, which would cause the Fund to terminate unless a substitute managing owner was obtained. Shareholders owning 50 or more of the Shares have the power to terminate the Fund. If it is so exercised, investors who may wish to continue to invest in a vehicle that tracks the Fund s Index will have to find another vehicle, and may not be able to find another vehicle that offers the same features as the Fund. See Description of the Shares Certain Material Terms of the Trust Agreement Termination Events in the Fund s Prospectus for a summary of termination events. Such detrimental developments could cause you to liquidate your investments and upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio. In addition, Shareholders could receive less from the sale of the Fund s assets in the

event of its liquidation and termination than amounts that could be realized from sales of those assets other than in the case of a liquidation and termination. If the registrations with the CFTC or memberships in the NFA of the Managing Owner or the Commodity Broker were revoked or suspended, such entity would no longer be able to provide services to the Fund. 
 Competing Claims Over Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights Related to the Fund Could Adversely Affect the Fund and an Investment in the Shares. 
 While the Managing Owner believes that all intellectual property rights needed to operate the Fund in the manner described in the Fund s Prospectus are either owned by or licensed to the Managing Owner or have been obtained, third parties may allege or assert ownership of intellectual property rights which may be related to the design, structure and operations of the Fund. To the extent any claims of such ownership are brought or any proceedings are instituted to assert such claims, the issuance of any restraining orders or injunctions, the negotiation, litigation or settlement of such claims, or the ultimate disposition of such claims in a court of law may adversely affect the Fund and an investment in the Shares. For example, such actions could result in expenses or damages payable by the Fund, suspension of activities or the termination of the Fund. 
 The Value of the Shares Will Be Adversely Affected if the Fund is Required to Indemnify the Trustee or the Managing Owner. 
 Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee and the Managing Owner have the right to be indemnified for any liability or expense they incur, except for any expenses resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. That means the Managing Owner may require the assets of the Fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Fund and, consequently, the value of the Shares. 
 Although the Shares Are Limited Liability Investments, Certain Circumstances such as Bankruptcy of the Fund or Indemnification of the Fund by the Shareholders Will Increase a Shareholder s Liability. 
 The Shares are limited liability investments investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest including any appreciation in their investments. However, Shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Fund any distribution they received at a time when the Fund was in fact insolvent or in violation of the Trust Agreement. In addition, Shareholders agree in the Trust Agreement that they will indemnify the Fund for any harm suffered by it as a result of: 

Shareholders actions unrelated to the business of the Fund, or 

taxes imposed on the Shares by the states or municipalities in which such investors reside. 

 The Fund May Lose Money on Its Holdings of Money Market Mutual Funds. 
 The Fund may invest in government money market funds that have chosen to not rely on the ability to impose fees on shareholder redemptions, or liquidity fees, or temporarily to suspend redemption privileges, or gates, if the government money market fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold. Although such government money market funds seek to preserve the value of an investment at 1.00 per share, there is no guarantee that they will be able to do so. As a result, the Fund may lose money by investing in a government money market fund. An investment in a government money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or any other government agency. The share price of a government money market fund can fall below the 1.00 share price. The Fund cannot rely on or expect a government money market fund s adviser or its affiliates to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the government money market fund s 1.00 share price. The credit quality of a government money market fund s holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the government money market fund s share price. Due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of securities held by a government money market fund may vary. A government money market fund s share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. 
 Due to the Increased Use of Technologies, Intentional and Unintentional Cyber Attacks Pose Operational and Information Security Risks. 
 With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, the Fund is susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. 
 Cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or breaches of the Fund s third party service providers (including, but not limited to, the Index Sponsor, the Administrator and the Transfer Agent) or money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of Shareholders or Authorized Participants to transact business in Shares and Creation Units respectively, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional 
 21 

compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its Shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. 
 While the Managing Owner has established business continuity plans and systems reasonably designed to detect and prevent such cyber attacks from being effective, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. For instance, it is possible that certain existing risks have not been identified or that new risks will emerge before countervailing measures can be implemented. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control, or even necessarily influence, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by the Fund s third party service providers. Since the Fund is dependent upon third party service providers (including the Managing Owner) for substantially all of its operational needs, the Fund is subject to the risk that a cyber attack on a service provider will materially impair its normal operations even if the Fund itself is not subject to such an attack. A cyber security incident that affects any of the Fund s service providers could result in loss or unintended disclosure of information or loss or theft of the Fund s assets, and could adversely impact the ability of the Fund s service providers to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Fund. In addition, a service provider that has experienced a cyber security incident may divert resources normally devoted to servicing the Fund to addressing the incident, which would be likely to have an adverse effect on the Fund s operations. Cyber attacks may also cause disruptions to the futures exchanges and clearinghouses through which the Fund invests in futures contracts and to the exchanges on which the Fund buys and sells shares of T-Bill ETFs, which could result in disruptions to the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective, resulting in financial losses to the Fund and Shareholders.

 Overview/Introduction 
 Invesco DB Energy Fund (the Fund ), a separate series of Invesco DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust (the Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust organized in seven separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 Invesco Capital Management LLC Invesco has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor, and it is a member firm of the National Futures Association NFA ). 
 The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Excess Return (the Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the energy sector. The commodities comprising the Index are Light Sweet Crude Oil, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (also commonly known as Heating Oil), Brent Crude Oil, RBOB Gasoline (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB and Natural Gas (each, an Index Commodity, and collectively, the Index Commodities ). 
 The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation or depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that expire in a specific month and trade on a specific exchange (the Index Contracts in the Index Commodities. The Fund also holds United States Treasury Obligations and T-Bill ETFs, if any, for deposit with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, the Fund s commodity broker (the Commodity Broker as margin, to the extent permissible under CFTC rules and United States Treasury Obligations, cash, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, on deposit with The Bank of New York Mellon (the Custodian ), for cash management purposes. The aggregate notional value of the commodity futures contracts owned by the Fund is expected to approximate the aggregate net asset value NAV of the Fund, as opposed to the aggregate Index value . 
 The CFTC and certain futures exchanges impose position limits on futures contracts, including on Index Contracts. As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 24 

The Shares are intended to provide investment results that generally correspond to the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the Index over time. The value of the Shares is expected to fluctuate in relation to changes in the value of the Fund s portfolio. The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the NAV per Share, but these two valuations are expected to be very close . 
 Margin Calls 
 Initial or original margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a futures trader with his commodity broker in order to initiate futures trading or to maintain an open position in futures contracts. Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than initial margin) to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the futures trader s performance of the futures contract that the trader purchases or sells. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 2 of the purchase price of the underlying commodity being traded. Because of such low margins, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that are greater, in relation to the amount invested, than are customary in other forms of investments. The minimum amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which such contract is traded, and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Variation margin is assessed daily to reflect changes in the value of the position. 
 Brokerage firms carrying accounts for traders in futures contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy in order to afford further protection for themselves. 
 Margin requirements are computed each day by a commodity broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the commodity broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the Fund s position. With respect to the Managing Owner s trading, only the Managing Owner, and not the Fund or its Shareholders personally, will be subject to margin calls. 
 Position Limits and/or Accountability Levels 
 The Fund has not reached position limits with respect to the 2022 and 2021 reporting periods. 
 Net Asset Value 
 NAV means the total assets of the Fund, including, but not limited to, all commodity futures contracts, cash and investments less total liabilities of the Fund, each determined on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ), consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting. All open commodity futures contracts will be calculated at their then current market value, which will be based upon the settlement price for that particular commodity futures contract traded on the applicable primary exchange on the date with respect to which NAV is being determined. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or became unreliable are valued at fair value as determined in good faith following procedures approved by the Managing Owner. The amount of any distribution is a liability of the Fund from the day when the distribution is declared until it is paid. 
 NAV per Share is the NAV of the Fund divided by the number of outstanding Shares. 
 Market Risk 
 Trading in futures contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The market risk associated with the Fund s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. 
 The Fund s exposure to market risk is also influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of the investors capital. 
 Credit Risk 
 When the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be 
 25 

required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, is designed to disperse and mitigate the credit risk posed by any one member. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to the Fund. 
 The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant FCM in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading. The Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading. While these legal requirements are designed to protect the customers of FCMs, a failure by the Commodity Broker to comply with those requirements would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the Fund in the event that the Commodity Broker became insolvent or suffered other financial distress. 
 Liquidity 
 The Fund s entire source of capital is derived from the Fund s offering of Shares to Authorized Participants. The Fund in turn allocates its net assets to commodity futures trading. A significant portion of the NAV is held in United States Treasury Obligations, which may be used as margin for the Fund s trading in commodity futures contracts and United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds, cash and T-Bill ETFs, if any, which may be used for cash management purposes. The percentage that United States Treasury Obligations bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Fund s commodity interests change. A portion of the Fund s United States Treasury Obligations is held for deposit with the Commodity Broker to meet margin requirements. All remaining cash, money market mutual funds, T-Bill ETFs, if any, and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with the Custodian. Interest earned on the Fund s interest-bearing funds and dividends from the Fund s holdings of money market mutual funds are paid to the Fund. Any dividends or distributions of capital gains received from the Fund s holdings of T-Bill ETFs, if any, are paid to the Fund. 
 The Fund s commodity futures contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations or for other reasons. For example, U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits, and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a limit price. Once a limit price has been reached in a particular contract, it is usually the case that no trades may be made at a different price than specified in the limit. The duration of limit prices generally varies. Limit prices may have the effect of precluding the Fund from trading in a particular contract or requiring the Fund to liquidate contracts at disadvantageous times or prices. Either of those outcomes could adversely affect the Fund s ability to pursue its investment objective . 
 Because the Fund trades futures contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of futures contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties (including the Commodity Broker and/or exchange clearinghouses) to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more blocks of 100,000 Shares Creation Units ). Redemption orders must be placed by 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to two business days after the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Creation Units. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 100,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Creation Units to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund no later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to two business days after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement CNS clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the NSCC (the CNS Clearing Process or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company DTC or the Depository (the DTC Process ), or a successor depository, and 
 26 

only in exchange for cash. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order and such fee is not borne by the Fund. 
 The Fund is unaware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the registrant's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 
 Capital Resources 
 The Fund does not have any material cash requirements as of the end of the latest fiscal period. The Fund is unaware of any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in the Fund s capital resources. 
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are commodity futures, the values of which are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in providing services to the Fund. While the Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Fund s financial position. The Managing Owner expects the risk of loss relating to indemnification to be remote. 
 The Fund has financial obligations to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker under the Trust Agreement and its agreement with the Commodity Broker (the Commodity Broker Agreement ), respectively. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s NAV. Commission payments to the Commodity Broker, pursuant to the Commodity Broker Agreement, are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the number of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs and trading activity will not be known until a future date. The Fund s agreement with the Commodity Broker may be terminated by either party for various reasons. All Management Fees and commission payments are paid to the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker, respectively. 
 Cash Flows 
 A primary cash flow activity of the Fund is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs, if any, and to meet margin requirements as a result of the positions taken in futures contracts to match the fluctuations of the Index. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing LP, Interactive Brokers LLC, Jefferies LLC, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Virtu Americas LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC has executed a Participant Agreement and are the only Authorized Participants. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities was (7.6) million and (13.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts primarily include net income (loss), net purchases and sales of money market mutual funds and net purchases and sales of United States Treasury Obligations and affiliated investments. The Fund invests in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, 238.0 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and 173.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 79.0 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and 61.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. 637.1 million was received from sales of affiliated investments and 611.8 million was paid to purchase 
 27 

affiliated investments during the year ended December 31, 2022 . 247.0 million was received from sales of affiliated investments and 280.5 million was paid to purchase affiliated investments during the year ended December 31, 2021 . 
 Financing Activities 
 The Fund s net cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities was 7.6 million and 13.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This included 195.9 million and 95.7 million from Shares purchased by Authorized Participants and 187.0 million and 82.1 million from Shares redeemed by Authorized Participants during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, distributions paid to Shareholders were 1.2 million. No distributions were paid to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Results of Operations 
 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 
 The following graphs illustrate the percentage changes in (i) the market price of the Shares (as reflected by the line Market ), (ii) the Fund s NAV (as reflected by the line NAV ), and (iii) the closing levels of the Index (as reflected by the line DBIQ Opt Yield Energy Index ER ). Whenever the Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, earned by the Fund exceeds Fund expenses, the price of the Shares generally exceeds the level of the Index primarily because the Share price reflects Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, from the Fund s collateral holdings whereas the Index does not consider such income. There can be no assurances that the price of the Shares or the Fund s NAV will exceed the Index levels. 
 No representation is being made that the Index will or is likely to achieve closing levels consistent with or similar to those set forth herein. Similarly, no representation is being made that the Fund will generate profits or losses similar to the Fund s past performance or changes in the Index closing levels.

Performance Summary 
 This Report covers the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For performance discussion related to the year ended December 31, 2020, see the annual report for the year ended December 31, 2020 available at http://www.invesco.com/ETFs. 
 Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the Index Commodities. In turn, the Index is intended to reflect the energy sector. Past Index results are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the Index closing levels. The DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Total Return (the DBIQ-OY Energy TR consists of the Index plus 3-month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Past results of the DBIQ-OY Energy TR are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the index s closing levels. 
 The section Summary of the DBIQ-OY Energy TR and Underlying Index Commodity Returns for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 below provides an overview of the changes in the closing levels of the DBIQ-OY Energy TR by disclosing the change in market value of each underlying component Index Commodity through a surrogate (and analogous) index that also reflects 3 month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Please note also that the Fund s objective is to track the Index (not the DBIQ-OY Energy TR and the Fund does not attempt to outperform or underperform the Index. The Index employs the optimum yield roll method with the objective of mitigating the negative effects of contango, the condition in which distant delivery prices for futures exceed spot prices, and maximizing the positive effects of backwardation, a condition opposite of contango.

If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income were to exceed the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund would be expected to outperform the Index and underperform the DBIQ-OY Energy TR . The only difference between (i) the Index (the Excess Return Index and (ii) the DBIQ-OY Energy TR (the Total Return Index is that the Excess Return Index does not include interest income from fixed income securities while the Total Return Index does include such a component. Thus, the difference between the Excess Return Index and the Total Return Index is attributable entirely to the interest income attributable to the fixed income securities reflected in the Total Return Index. The Total Return Index does not actually hold any fixed income securities. If the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, exceeds the Fund s fees and expenses, then the amount of such excess is expected to be distributed periodically. The market price of the Shares is expected to closely track the Excess Return Index. The aggregate return on an investment in the Fund over any period is the sum of the capital appreciation or depreciation of the Shares over the period, plus the amount of any distributions during the period. Consequently, the Fund s aggregate return is expected to outperform the Excess Return Index by the amount of the excess, if any, of the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income over its fees and expenses. As a result of the Fund s fees and expenses, however, the aggregate return on the Fund is expected to underperform the Total Return Index. If the Fund s fees and expenses were to exceed the Fund s Treasury Income, Money Market Income and T-Bill ETF Income, if any, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to underperform the Excess Return Index.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 
 Fund Share Price Performance 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 17.12 per Share to 22.65 per Share. The Share price low and high for the year ended December 31, 2022 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2021 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 17.37 per Share (+1.46 on January 3, 2022, and a high of 30.39 per Share (+77.51 on June 9, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the Fund paid a distribution of 0.17073 for each General Share and Share to holders of record as of December 20, 2022. Therefore, the total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +33.33 . 
 Energy commodities rallied aggressively in 2022, with the Fund posting a return of over 30 . Despite the significant pull back towards the end of the second quarter through the third quarter due to intensifying recession fears, snowballing supply concerns fueled by Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions measures, most notably the EU s ban of Russian oil and refined products, had sent both front month Brent and WTI crude oil prices into triple digit territory. Front month gasoline and NY Harbor ULSD prices were also up over 60 in the first half of the year on dwindling supplies but did reverse sharply starting in the third quarter on growing recession fears, before gaining a bit again in the fourth quarter. US natural gas also whipsawed through gains and losses as Europe scrambled to replace Russian supplies, while a fire at Freeport s liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in Texas curbed US export capacity. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share increased from 10.86 per Share to 17.12 
 per Share. The Share price low and high for the year ended December 31, 2021 and related change from the Share price on December 31, 2020 was as follows: Shares traded at a low of 10.70 per Share (-1.47 on January 4, 2021, and a high of 18.75 per Share (+72.69 on October 26, 2021. No distributions were paid to Shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, the 
 total return for the Fund on a market value basis was +57.64 . 
 Energy commodity prices rallied significantly through 2021, supported by the rare occurrence of a strong cycle in oil, with rising demand and tightening supplies happening simultaneously. World production was at decade lows following the historic OPEC+ production cut in spring 2020 and reduced North American production to combat the collapsing demand resulting from global lockdowns. As vaccines rolled out and global economies came back to life, pent up demand driven by COVID-19 fatigue led to rapidly tightened balances. Demand for transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel recovered quicker than expected. In addition, natural gas prices skyrocketed in the fourth quarter to levels not seen since 2008, as the global energy crisis intensified. A combination of rising demand in Asia and Europe, coupled with restricted global supplies created the perfect storm for the commodity and the energy market overall. 
 Fund Share Net Asset Performance 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the NAV of each Share increased from 17.07 per Share to 22.65 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Brent Crude Oil, Light Sweet Crude Oil, Natural Gas, RBOB Gasoline and Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel during the year ended December 31, 2022 contributed to an overall 32.69 increase in the level of the Index and to a 35.41 increase in the level of the DBIQ-OY Energy TR . On December 23, 2022, the Fund paid a distribution of 0.17073 for each General Share and Share to holders of record as of December 20, 2022. Therefore, the total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +33.73 . 
 Net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 38.8 million, primarily resulting from income of 3.0 million, net realized gain (loss) of 44.4 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (7.0) million and net operating expenses of 1.6 million. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the NAV of each Share increased from 10.86 per Share to 17.07 per Share. Rising commodity futures contract prices for Light Sweet Crude Oil, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel, Brent Crude Oil, RBOB Gasoline, and Natural Gas during the year ended December 31, 2021 contributed to an overall 58.28 increase in the level of the Index and to a 58.34 increase in the level of the DBIQ-OY Energy TR . No distributions were paid to Shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. Therefore, the total return for the Fund on a NAV basis was +57.18 . 
 Net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 35.3 million, primarily resulting from income of 0.0 million, net realized gain (loss) of 38.3 million, net change in unrealized gain (loss) of (2.2) million and net operating expenses of 0.8 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Fund s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 
 There were no material estimates, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and had or are reasonably likely to have had a material impact on the Fund s financial condition, used in the preparation of these financial statements. 

ITEM 7A. 
 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 INTRODUCTION 
 The Fund is designed to track the performance of the Index. The market sensitive instruments held by it are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 
 Market movements can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the prices of commodities. 
 Standard of Materiality 
 Materiality as used in this section, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the effects of margin, and any other multiplier features, as applicable, of the Fund s market sensitive instruments. 
 QUANTIFYING THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period). 
 Value at Risk VaR is a statistical measure of the value of losses that would not be expected to be exceeded over a given time horizon and at a given probability level arising from movement of underlying risk factors. Loss is measured as a decline in the fair value of the portfolio as a result of changes in any of the material variables by which fair values are determined. VaR is measured over a specified holding period (one day) and to a specified level of statistical confidence (99th percentile). However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of these considerations, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the following VaR presentation does not constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR. 
 THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 The Fund calculates VaR using the actual historical market movements of the Fund s net assets. 
 The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of December 31, 2022.

The VaR represents the one day downside risk, under normal market conditions, with a 99 confidence level. It is calculated using historical market moves of the Fund s net assets and uses a one year look back. 
 THE FUND S NON-TRADING MARKET RISK 
 The Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. Although the Fund purchases and sells shares of T-Bill ETFs on an exchange, it does not establish or liquidate those positions for trading purposes. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING PRIMARY TRADING MARKET RISK EXPOSURES 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures of the Fund. The Fund s current market exposure may change materially. Investors may lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 
 The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Fund as of December 31, 2022 by Index Commodity. 
 Light Sweet Crude Oil 
 The price of light sweet crude oil is volatile and is affected by numerous factors. The level of global industrial activity influences the demand for light sweet crude oil. In addition, various other factors can affect the demand for light sweet crude oil, such as weather, political events and labor activity. The supply of light sweet crude oil can be affected by many events, in particular, the meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Market expectations about events that will influence either demand or supply can cause prices for light sweet crude oil to fluctuate greatly. A significant amount of the world oil production capacity is controlled by a relatively small number of producers. Any large change in production by one of these producers could have a substantial effect on the price of light sweet crude oil. 
 Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (also commonly known as Heating Oil) 
 The price of Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel is volatile and is affected by numerous factors. The level of global industrial activity influences the demand for Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel. In addition, the seasonal temperatures in countries throughout the world can also heavily influence the demand for Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel. Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel is derived from crude oil and as such, any factors that influence the supply of crude oil may also influence the supply of Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel. 
 Brent Crude Oil 
 The price of Brent Crude Oil is volatile and is affected by numerous factors. The price of Brent Crude Oil is influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of output by oil producing nations, worldwide supply/stockpiles, weather, various geopolitical factors that cause supply disruptions e.g ., war, terrorism), global demand (particularly from emerging nations), currency fluctuations, and activities of market participants such as hedgers and speculators. 
 RBOB Gasoline 
 The price of RBOB Gasoline is volatile and is affected by numerous factors. The level of global industrial activity influences the demand for RBOB Gasoline. In addition, the demand has seasonal variations, which occur during driving seasons usually considered the summer months in North America and Europe. RBOB Gasoline is derived from crude oil and as such, any factors that influence the supply of crude oil may also influence the supply of RBOB Gasoline. 
 33 

Natural Gas 
 The price of natural gas is volatile and is affected by numerous factors. The level of global industrial activity influences the demand for natural gas. In addition to the seasonal temperatures in countries throughout the world, any fluctuations in temperature may also heavily influence the demand for natural gas. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-TRADING MARKET RISK EXPOSURE 
 As noted above, the Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations, T-Bill ETFs and money market mutual funds. The market risk represented by these investments is not expected to be material. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING MEANS OF MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s exercise of discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s use of its discretionary powers may increase. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or manmade disasters. The Managing Owner does not actively manage the Fund to avoid losses. The Fund only takes long positions in investments and does not employ stop-loss techniques.

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of Invesco Capital Management LLC, as managing owner (the Managing Owner of Invesco DB Energy Fund (the Fund ), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 We, Anna Paglia, Principal Executive Officer, and Kelli Gallegos, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, of the Managing Owner, assessed the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, we have concluded that the Fund maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Fund s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the Fund s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report on page 37 of the Fund s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Managers of Invesco Capital Management LLC (as Managing Owner of 
 Invesco DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust) and Shareholders of Invesco DB Energy Fund 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition, including the schedules of investments, of Invesco DB Energy Fund (one of the funds constituting Invesco DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust, hereafter referred to as the Fund as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the related statements of income and expenses, of changes in shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Fund's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Fund maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Fund's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting , included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Fund s financial statements and on the Fund's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits i n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 37 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined there are no critical audit matters.

Invesco DB Energy Fund 
 Notes to Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2022 separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 Invesco Capital Management LLC Invesco has served as the managing owner (the Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner holds general shares (the General Shares of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. 
 The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the DBIQ Optimum Yield Energy Index Excess Return (the Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations Treasury Income ), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) Money Market Income and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) T-Bill ETF Income over the expenses of the Fund. The Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Index is intended to reflect the change in market value of the energy sector. The commodities comprising the Index are Light Sweet Crude Oil, Ultra-Low Sulphur Diesel (also commonly known as Heating Oil), Brent Crude Oil, RBOB Gasoline, (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or RBOB ), and Natural Gas (each, an Index Commodity, and collectively, the Index Commodities ). 
 The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds ETFs (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to months T-Bill ETFs ). The Fund holds as collateral United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes. While the Fund s performance reflects the appreciation and depreciation of those holdings, the Fund s performance, whether positive or negative, is driven primarily by its strategy of trading futures contracts with the aim of seeking to track the Index. 
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC and certain futures exchanges impose position limits on futures contracts that reference Index Commodities (the Index Contracts ). As the Fund approaches or reaches position limits with respect to an Index Commodity, the Fund may commence investing in Index Contracts that reference other Index Commodities. In those circumstances, the Fund may also trade in futures contracts based on commodities other than Index Commodities that the Managing Owner reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Managing Owner may determine to invest in other futures contracts if at any time it is impractical or inefficient to gain full or partial exposure to an Index Commodity through the use of Index Contracts. These other futures contracts may or may not be based on an Index Commodity. When they are not, the Managing Owner may seek to select futures contracts that it reasonably believes tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with an Index Contract. 
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the Shares only to certain eligible financial institutions (the Authorized Participants in or more blocks of Shares Creation Units ). The Fund commenced investment operations on January 3, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on January 5, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc.
