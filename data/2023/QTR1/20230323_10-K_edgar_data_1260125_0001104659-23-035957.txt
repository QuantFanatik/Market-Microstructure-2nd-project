 EXHIBIT 33.1

Exhibit 33.1 

Management s Assessment on Compliance
with SEC Regulation AB Criteria 

Management of Hyundai Capital America (the Company)
is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of auto receivable backed security transactions issued on or after January 1,
2006 (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii)-(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(3)(iii)-(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ix)-(xiii),
and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the
Applicable Servicing Criteria) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Reporting Period). With respect to Applicable
Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31,
2022 with respect to the Platform because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.
Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. 

With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and
1122(d)(4)(iv), management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company s
management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer, as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation
AB, and the Company s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged
by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company s management
is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 

The Company s management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation
AB. 

Based on such assessment, management believes
that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 

Baker Tilly US, LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

The Board of Directors 
Hyundai Capital America 

We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Management s Assessment on Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Criteria (Management s Assessment),
that Hyundai Capital America (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for all publicly issued asset-back securities transactions
backed by automobile retail installment sale contracts for which the Company acted as servicer and that were issued on or after January 1,
2006 (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii)-(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iv),
1122(d)(3)(iii)-(iv), 1122(d)(4)(ix)-(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing
activities it performs with respect to the Platform. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii),
the Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with the respect to the
Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management s
Assessment identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management
is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the Servicing Criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the
Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company
during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides, and that the
evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As described in the accompanying Management s
Assessment, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors are considered a servicer as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06,
Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to
apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures
with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that
the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) for
which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the
Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. With respect
to the Platform, Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to remittances. Management is responsible for
the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing
activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors
may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by
the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with the Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
