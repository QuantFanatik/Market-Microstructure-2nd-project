 Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. HDCC or Company ), the seller, servicer and sponsor, is a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. HDFS ). HDFS, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the financing division of Harley-Davidson, Inc. HDCC and its affiliates provide retail financial services to consumers primarily in the United States and Canada and wholesale financial services primarily to Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealers in the United States and Canada. Harley-Davidson Customer Funding Corp. CFC ), the depositor, is a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned special-purpose finance subsidiary of HDCC. All of the officers and directors of CFC are also employed by HDCC or HDFS, except that at least two directors of CFC will at all times be independent of HDCC, HDFS and Harley-Davidson, Inc. CFC s business is limited to, among other things, (i) purchasing the contracts and related property (and other similar promissory note and security agreements) from HDCC (in its capacity as seller), (ii) acting as the beneficial owner of the issuing entity Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Trust 2021-A (the Trust and other similar trusts and (iii) performing its obligations under the transfer and servicing agreements to which it is a party (including similar agreements entered into in connection with the formation of similar trusts). 
 Annual losses on the retail motorcycle loans serviced by HDCC were 1.88 during 2022 compared to 1.19 in 2021. The 30-day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans serviced by HDCC at December 31, 2022 increased to 4.50 from 3.33 at December 31, 2021. The unfavorable retail credit loss and delinquency performance were driven by delinquencies and losses returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels following a period of favorable performance supported by benefits provided to individuals under the U.S. federal stimulus packages and COVID-19 pandemic retail payment extensions. HDCC ceased providing COVID-19-related extensions in the second quarter of 2021. HDCC continues to grant payment extensions to its customers consistent with its standard policies and practices in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, credit losses were unfavorably impacted by lower motorcycle recovery values at auction. HDCC expects delinquencies to continue to normalize to pre-COVID rates over time due to the termination of the COVID-19-related extension program and as the impact of federal stimulus benefits wanes. HDCC believes its retail credit losses may continue to increase over time due to changing consumer credit behavior and new financing programs that may result in different loan performance than existing programs. Increases in the frequency of loss and decreases in the value of repossessed Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles also adversely impact credit losses. If there are adverse circumstances that involve a material decline in values of Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles, which may result from actions that Harley-Davidson has taken or could take that impact motorcycle values, those circumstances or any related decline in resale values for Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles could contribute to increased delinquencies and credit losses. The assets owned by the Trust may experience credit losses at rates that are the same as, greater than or less than those of the retail motorcycle loans that HDCC or its affiliates originated and HDCC services taken as a whole.

Exhibit 34.1 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. 
 
 We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the public asset-backed securities transactions for which the Company acted as servicer, involving motorcycle loans, issued on or after January 1, 2006 (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122 (d)(1)(iv), 1122 (d)(2)(iv), 1122 (d)(2)(v), 1122 (d)(2)(vi), 1122 (d)(3)(iii), 1122 (d)(4)(ix), 1122 (d)(4)(x), 1122 (d)(4)(xi), 1122 (d)(4)(xii), 1122 (d)(4)(xiii) and 1122 (d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix A for the asset-backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporate Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C&DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in management's assertion for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i), 1122 (d)(4)(i), 1122 (d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C&DI 200.06. As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i), 1122 (d)(4)(i), 1122 (d)(4)(ii) and 1122 (d)(4)(viii), for which compliance is determined based on C&DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

With respect to the Platform, Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to remittances. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected 
 asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.

 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
