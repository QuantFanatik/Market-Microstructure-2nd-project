Products by Business Line Our broad portfolio of products addresses multiple high-growth, consumer-focused end markets. A key component of our product strategy is to supply multiple related product offerings to each of the end markets that we serve. Display Solutions Display Driver Characteristics. Display drivers deliver defined analog voltages and currents that activate pixels to exhibit images on displays. The following key characteristics determine display driver performance and end-market application: 

Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution determines the level of detail displayed within an image and is defined by the number of pixels per line multiplied by the number of lines on a display. For large displays, higher resolution typically requires more display drivers for each panel. Display drivers that have a greater number of channels, however, generally require fewer display drivers for each panel and command a higher selling price per unit. Mobile displays, conversely, are typically single chip solutions designed to deliver a specific resolution. We cover resolutions ranging from VGA (640 x 480) to UHD (3840 x 2160). 

Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a panel. For example, for TFT-LCD panels, 262 thousand colors are supported by 6-bit source drivers; 16 million colors are supported by 8-bit source drivers; and 1 billion colors are supported by 10-bit source drivers. 

Operational Voltage. Display drivers are characterized by input and output voltages. Source drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages between 9 and 18 volts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages from 30 to 45 volts. Lower input voltage results in lower power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI). 

Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to the pixel by the source driver is referred to as the gamma curve. The gamma curve of the source driver can correct some imperfections in picture quality in a process generally known as gamma correction. Some advanced display drivers feature up to three independent gamma curves to facilitate this correction. 

Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and the display drivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data transfer rate necessary for higher definition images. The principal types of interface technologies are embedded clock point to point interface (EPI), mini-low voltage differential signaling (m-LVDS), unified standard interface (USI) and mobile industry processor interface (MIPI). 

Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses COF, COG and COP package types.

Intellectual Property As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of intellectual property assets included approximately 961 registered patents and 144 pending patent applications. Approximately 433 and 52 of our patents and pending applications, respectively, are novel in that they are not a foreign counterpart of an existing patent or patent application. Because we file patents in multiple jurisdictions, we additionally have approximately 528 registered patents and 92 pending applications that relate to identical technical claims in our base patent portfolio. Our patents expire at various times approximately over the next 19 years. While these patents are in the aggregate important to our competitive position, we do not believe that any single registered or pending patent is material to us. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology and know-how, as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. National Core Technology Under the Act on Prevention of Leakage and Protection of Industrial Technology of Korea (the ITA ), any export (including various means of outflow such as sale or transfer outside Korea) of technology designated as national core technology National Core Technology or NCT by the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (the MOTIE requires the filing of a prior-report with, and the acceptance of the same by, the MOTIE. Any such export of NCT without the acceptance of the prior report with the MOTIE may be subject to corrective orders by the relevant authorities, and failure to comply with such corrective orders may potentially result in criminal liabilities. The Notification Regarding Designation of National Core Technologies issued by the MOTIE was amended on July 14, 2021 to add certain technologies to the list of National Core Technology designated by the MOTIE, and the amended list includes the design technology for OLED Display Driver IC for driving display panels OLED DDI ). In the ordinary course of business, our Korean subsidiary may provide certain information relating to its products, including OLED DDI, to customers, suppliers or vendors, and such disclosure of information may be subject to the NCT-related regulations under the ITA, and therefore the MOTIE s acceptance of prior-reports. Since the amendment of the foregoing NCT list in July 2021, we have filed prior-reports with the MOTIE for the export of our OLED DDI product-related information to certain overseas vendors that manufacture our products, and all such reports have thus far been accepted by the MOTIE. Competition We operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change and continually advancing customer requirements. Although no one company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in each of our market segments. Our competitors include other independent and captive manufacturers and designers of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, including display driver and power management semiconductor devices. We compete based on design experience, manufacturing capabilities, the ability to satisfy customer needs from the design phase through the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle and quality of technical support and sales personnel. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on internal and external variables, both within and outside of our control. These variables include the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields, capacity availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.

Employees also have access to other benefits such as personal pensions, housing assistance, medical reimbursement plans and educational assistance programs. Safety and Wellness During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been ensuring the health and safety of our employees and their families. We built a companywide control tower to provide appropriate response guidance as the pandemic has evolved, and have secured internal/external capabilities to respond to emergencies systematically. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly instituted infrastructure to support remote working, so that our employees could work from home in a safe and stable environment. In addition, we have installed safety facilities within our business sites. Environmental We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) and waste, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Since 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulation, the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme, or K-ETS, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing the emission or purchasing the allowances from other participants in the emission trading market.

Another example is the newly reinforced regulations on chemicals under Chemicals Control Act and K-REACH, which came into effect on January 1, 2015. Under these laws, our Korean subsidiary is required to comply with various requirements to report, evaluate, manage and ensure the safe usage of the chemicals used in its facilities. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be in compliance with all of these laws and regulations, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws and the failure to comply with new or existing laws or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations. Raw Materials We use processes that require specialized raw materials that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. We continue to attempt to qualify additional suppliers for our raw materials. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, has adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These conflict minerals are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risk Factors Summary The following is a summary of the risk factors included herein. 

We manufacture our products based on our estimates of customer demand, and if our estimates are incorrect, our financial results could be negatively impacted. 

A significant portion of our sales comes from a relatively limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our financial results. 

The average selling prices of our semiconductor products have at times declined rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit. 

We are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in the exchange rates of applicable currencies could impact our results of operations. 

Global shortages in manufacturing capacities could interrupt or negatively affect our operations, increase cost to manufacture and negatively impact our results of operations. 

Expanded trade restrictions may limit our ability to sell to certain customers. 

Recent changes in international trade policy and the imposition and threats of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Our Korean subsidiary has been designated as a regulated business under Korean environmental law, and such designation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 

Our compliance with the Serious Accidents Punishment Act (the SAPA could require significant expenditures and management time and expose us to liability for violations. 
 19 

Table of Contents 

Our business depends on international customers, suppliers and operations in Asia, and as a result we are subject to regulatory, operational, financial and political risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. 

We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be successfully consummated, or that it will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock. 

Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware Law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress the price of our common stock. 

We have not historically paid dividends and do not currently have any dividend or distribution policy, and therefore, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Risks Related to Our Business We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns that may negatively impact our results of operations. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular. Periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. We have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged, downturns in the future as a result of such cyclical changes. This may reduce our results of operations. Over the prior two years, increases in demand for semiconductor products resulted in a global shortage of manufacturing capacities. As a result, we experienced increases in the costs to manufacture our products. We are not able to foresee when the current shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside. If we are unable secure manufacturing capacities from our current subcontractors, our ability to deliver our products to our customers may be negatively impacted. These factors could cause a negative impact on our results of operations. However, we are beginning to see some indicators of improvement of such supply shortage situation. Current global macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 pandemic, higher inflation and interest rates and uncertainty caused by the Russian-Ukraine war, have led to weaker end-market demand and an oversupply of inventory. We continue to monitor these trends and uncertainties, and any decline in end-market demand and increase in inventory levels could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue, and a significant portion of our expenses is relatively fixed in the short term. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter. Our restructuring activities and dispositions of assets and businesses could result in lost business and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. From time to time, we may choose to sell assets, restructure business operations, shut down manufacturing lines or otherwise dispose of assets and businesses as part of management s strategies to better align our product offerings with market demands and our customers needs. In connection with these activities, we face risks that we will disrupt service to our customers, lose business and incur significant costs related to such activities. These risks include potential damage to our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to effectively transition such customer relationships to other production lines or products or if we cannot effectively manage our supplier and vendor relationships during such activities. In addition, we may also face claims or costs 
 20

associated with transitioning or eliminating certain employee positions and modifying or terminating vendor relationships in connection with those exit activities. If we fail to develop new products and technologies or enhance our existing products in order to react to rapid technological change and market demands, our business will suffer. Our industry is subject to constant and rapid technological change and product obsolescence as customers and competitors create new and innovative products and technologies. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and we may not be able to access advanced process technologies, including smaller geometries, or to license or otherwise obtain essential intellectual property required by our customers. We must develop new products and enhance our existing products to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements. We design products for customers that continually require higher performance and functionality at lower costs. We must, therefore, continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products. The development process for these advancements is lengthy and requires us to accurately anticipate technological changes and market trends. Developing and enhancing these products is uncertain and can be time-consuming, costly and complex. Customer and market requirements can change during the development of a product. There is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late, fail to meet customer or market specifications or not be competitive with products from our competitors that offer comparable or superior performance and functionality. Any new products, such as our expanding line of power management solutions, or product enhancements, may not be accepted in new or existing markets. Our business will suffer if we fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We manufacture our products based on our estimates of customer demand, and if our estimates are incorrect, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer demand and expected demand for and success of their products. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to estimate accurately future customer demand for our products. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in supply, which can challenge our production resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers increased demand for our products. Conversely, downturns in the semiconductor industry have caused and may in the future cause our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products they order from us. Because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand would decrease our results of operations, including our gross profit. Our customers may cancel their orders, reduce quantities or delay production, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers may cancel their orders, reduce quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers, which we have experienced as a result of periodic downturns in the semiconductor industry, or failure to achieve design-wins, have affected and may continue to affect our results of operations adversely. These risks are exacerbated because many of our products are customized, which hampers our ability to sell excess inventory to the general market. We may incur charges resulting from the write-off of obsolete inventory. In addition, while we do not obtain long-term purchase commitments, we generally agree to the pricing of a particular product over a set period of time. If we underestimate our costs when determining pricing, our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our fab manufacturing depends on high utilization of our manufacturing capacity, a reduction of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the results of our operations. An important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our fabrication facility. As many of our costs are fixed, a reduction in capacity utilization, as well as changes in other factors, such as reduced yield or unfavorable product mix, could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our operating results. A number of factors and circumstances may reduce utilization rates, including periods of industry overcapacity, the inability to source sufficient materials necessary for manufacturing, low levels of customer orders, operating inefficiencies, strategic evaluations and decisions by our Board related our overall business, divisions and business lines, mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion or relocation of operations, power interruptions and fire, flood or other natural disasters or calamities. The potential delays and costs resulting from these factors and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our sales comes from a relatively limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our financial results. Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we were to lose key customers or if customers cease to place orders for our high-volume products, particularly our display products, our financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, our arrangements with and reliance on key customers may make it less practicable to pursue certain opportunities with other potential new and existing customers. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our ten largest customers accounted for 69.4 , 79.8 and 87.6 of net sales from our standard products business, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales to Samsung Display represented 19.0 of net sales from our standard products business and 80.2 of net sales from our Display Solutions business line, and SAMT represented 13.8 of net sales from our standard products business and 18.1 of net sales from our Power Solutions business line. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to Samsung Display represented 42.5 of net sales from our standard products business and 89.7 of net sales from our Display Solutions business line, and SAMT represented 10.4 of net sales from our standard products business and 19.8 of net sales from our Power Solutions business line. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to Samsung Display represented 56.2 of net sales from our standard products business and 87.5 of net sales from our Display Solutions business line. Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, especially our few largest customers, the loss of other major customers or a general curtailment in orders for our high-volume products within a short period of time could adversely affect our business. The average selling prices of our semiconductor products have at times declined rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit. The semiconductor products we develop and sell are subject to rapid declines in average selling prices. From time to time, we have had to reduce our prices significantly to meet customer requirements, and we may be required to reduce our prices in the future. This would cause our gross profit to decrease. Our financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing our costs or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profit. Our industry is highly competitive, and our ability to compete could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors. The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and includes hundreds of companies, a number of which have achieved substantial market share within both our product categories and end markets. Current and prospective customers for our products and services evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our competitors. Some of our competitors are well established as independent companies and have substantially 
 22 

Table of Contents 

greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in certain of our end markets and with the internal semiconductor design and manufacturing capabilities of many of our significant customers. We expect to experience continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants. Any consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources, further enhancing their competitive position. Our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors, including the following: 

our ability to offer cost-effective and high quality products and services on a timely basis using our technologies; 

our ability to accurately identify and respond to emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics; 

our ability to continue to rapidly introduce new products that are accepted by the market; 

our ability to adopt or adapt to emerging industry standards; 

the number and nature of our competitors and competitiveness of their products and services in a given market; 

entrance of new competitors into our markets; and 

our ability to enter the highly competitive power management market. Many of these factors are outside of our control. In the future, our competitors may replace us as a supplier to our existing or potential customers, and our customers may satisfy more of their requirements internally. As a result, we may experience declining revenues and results of operations. Changes in demand for consumer electronics in our end markets can impact our results of operations. Demand for our products will depend in part on the demand for various consumer electronics products, in particular, mobile phones and multimedia devices, digital televisions, flat panel displays, mobile PCs and digital cameras, which in turn depends on general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. If our customers fail to introduce new products that employ our products or component parts, demand for our products will suffer. To the extent that we cannot offset periods of reduced demand that may occur in these markets through greater penetration of these markets or reduction in our production and costs, our sales and gross profit may decline, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to achieve design-wins for our semiconductor products, we may lose the opportunity for sales to customers for a significant period of time and be unable to recoup our investments in our products. We expend considerable resources on winning competitive selection processes, known as design-wins, to develop semiconductor products for use in our customers products. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. Once a customer designs a semiconductor into a product, that customer is likely to continue to use the same semiconductor or enhanced versions of that semiconductor from the same supplier across a number of similar and successor products for a lengthy period of time due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier and potentially redesigning the product to incorporate a different semiconductor. If we fail to achieve initial design-wins in a customer s qualification process, we may lose the opportunity for significant sales to that customer for a number of products and for a lengthy period of time. This may cause us to be unable to recoup our investments in our semiconductor products, which would harm our business.

We have lengthy and expensive design-to-mass production and manufacturing process development cycles that may cause us to incur significant expenses without realizing meaningful sales, the occurrence of which would harm our business. The cycle time from the design stage to mass production for some of our products is long and requires the investment of significant resources with many potential customers without any guarantee of sales. Our design-to-mass production cycle typically begins with a three-to-twelve month semiconductor development stage and test period followed by a three-to-twelve month end-product qualification period by our customers. The fairly lengthy front end of our sales cycle creates a risk that we may incur significant expenses but may be unable to realize meaningful sales. Moreover, prior to mass production, customers may decide to cancel their products or change production specifications, resulting in sudden changes in our product specifications, increasing our production time and costs. Failure to meet such specifications may also delay the launch of our products or result in lost sales. Research and development investments may not yield profitable and commercially viable products, and thus will not necessarily result in increases in revenues for us. We invest significant resources in our research and development. Our research and development efforts, however, may not yield profitable or commercially viable products. During each stage of research and development, there is a substantial risk that we will have to abandon a potential product that is no longer marketable and in which we have invested significant resources. In the event we are able to develop viable new products, a significant amount of time will have elapsed between our investment in the necessary research and development effort and the receipt of any related revenues. We face numerous challenges relating to executing our growth strategy, and if we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Our growth strategy is to leverage our advanced analog and mixed-signal technology platform, continue to innovate and deliver new products, increase business with existing customers, broaden our customer base, aggressively grow our power business, and drive execution excellence. If we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. Moreover, if our allocation of resources does not correspond with future demand for particular products, we could miss market opportunities and our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. We are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in the exchange rates of applicable currencies could impact our results of operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non-U.S. currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in U.S. dollars relative to Korean won, a depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. For example, foreign currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on our reported profit margins and operating income from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 due to a relatively stronger Korean won during the period, while we had a favorable impact on our reported profit margins and operating income from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 due to a relatively weaker Korean won during the period. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the 
 24 

Table of Contents 

U.S. dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interests between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was 311.0 million. Our Dutch subsidiary uses the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. From time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of U.S. dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. These foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts typically require us to sell specified notional amounts in U.S. dollars and provide us the option to sell specified notional amounts in U.S. dollars during successive months to our counterparty in exchange for Korean won at specified exchange rates. Obligations under these foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than 30 million at the end of a fiscal quarter. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting our Results of Operations for further details. The loss of our key employees would materially adversely affect our business, and we may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to compete in our industry. Our key executives have substantial experience and have made significant contributions to our business, and our continued success is dependent upon the retention of our key management executives. The loss of such key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled technical and managerial personnel. We do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy. The loss of the services of key employees, especially our key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could hinder our research and product development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. If we encounter future labor problems, we may fail to deliver our products and services in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. As of December 31, 2022, 485 employees, or approximately 56 of our employees, were represented by the Magnachip Semiconductor Labor Unions. We can offer no assurance that any issues with the labor union and other employees will be resolved favorably for us in the future, that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in future years or that we will not incur significant expenses related to such issues. We may incur costs to engage in future business combinations or strategic investments, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions. As part of our business strategy, we may seek to enter into business combinations, investments, joint ventures and other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence as well as to provide us with access to technology, products and services. Any such transaction would be accompanied by risks that may harm our business, such as difficulties in assimilating the operations, personnel and products of an acquired business or in realizing the projected benefits, disruption of our ongoing business, 
 25

potential increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and charges if the acquired company or assets are later determined to be worth less than the amount paid for them in an earlier original acquisition. In addition, our indebtedness may restrict us from making acquisitions that we may otherwise wish to pursue. The failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields could adversely affect our business. The manufacturing of semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require precision, a highly regulated and sterile environment and specialized equipment. Defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can prevent us from achieving acceptable yields in the manufacturing of our products, which could lead to higher costs, a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our products. Slight impurities or defects in the photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause significant difficulties, particularly in connection with the production of a new product, the adoption of a new manufacturing process or any expansion of our manufacturing capacity and related transitions. We may also experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields as a result of, among other things, transferring production to other facilities, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies. Yields below our target levels can negatively impact our gross profit and may cause us to eliminate underperforming products. We rely on a number of independent subcontractors and the failure of any of these independent subcontractors to perform as required could adversely affect our operating results. A substantial portion of our net sales are derived from semiconductor devices assembled in packages or on film. The packaging and testing of semiconductors require technical skills and specialized equipment. For the portion of packaging and testing that we outsource, we use subcontractors located in Korea and China. We rely on these subcontractors to package and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels, and, while we specify quality standards, we are not able to directly oversee their day-to-day operations and the packaging and testing of our devices. Onboarding of a new subcontractor, including as a result of switching from one subcontractor to another, takes approximately three to six months to verify the subcontractor s capabilities and an additional six to twelve months to receive approval from our customers to use such subcontractor. We could be adversely affected by political disorders, labor disruptions, public health issues (including viral outbreaks such as COVID-19) and natural disasters where our subcontractors are located due to the time it would take to onboard a new subcontractor. If our semiconductor packagers and test service subcontractors experience problems in packaging and testing our semiconductor devices, experience prolonged quality or yield problems, experience shutdowns or delays associated with public health issues (such as those associated with COVID-19), or decrease the capacity of their operations available to us, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cooperate with independent foundries to produce certain Display Solutions and Power Solutions products, and the failure of such independent foundries to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business. We use independent foundry services for certain of our OLED Display Solutions products and Power Solutions products. Silicon wafer production at these facilities is allocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control. Therefore, any disruption in wafer supply from these vendors could have a material impact on our revenue and results of operations. Global shortages in manufacturing capacities could interrupt or negatively affect our operations, increase cost to manufacture and negatively impact our results of operations. Increases in demand for semiconductor products resulted in a global shortage of manufacturing capacity over the prior two years. As a result, we may experience increases in the costs to manufacture our products and may not be able to manufacture and deliver all of the orders placed by our customers. We are not able to foresee when the current shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside. If we are unable secure manufacturing capacities from our current subcontractors, our ability to deliver our products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, our subcontractors may increase their fees, which would result in an increase in our 
 26 

Table of Contents 

manufacturing costs, which we may not be fully able to pass to our customers. These factors could cause a negative impact on our results of operations. We depend on successful parts and materials procurement for our manufacturing processes, and a shortage or increase in the price of these materials could interrupt our operations and result in a decline of revenues and results of operations. We procure materials and electronic and mechanical components from international sources and original equipment manufacturers. We use a wide range of parts and materials in the production of our semiconductors, including silicon, processing chemicals, processing gases, precious metals and electronic and mechanical components, some of which, such as silicon wafers, are specialized raw materials that are generally only available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supply decreases for any reason, the costs of our raw materials could significantly increase. For example, worldwide supplies of silicon wafers, an important raw material for the semiconductors we manufacture, have been constrained in recent years due to an increased demand for silicon. We from time to time may enter into multi-year agreements, which specify future quantities and pricing of materials to be supplied by the vendors of these materials; however, this option may not be available to us and we cannot assure that supply increases will match demand increases. If we cannot obtain adequate materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms for the manufacture of our products, revenues and results of operations will decline. Compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products. The SEC, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer s efforts regarding the source of such minerals. These conflict minerals are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. We may also incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as free of conflict materials, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. We face warranty claims, product return, litigation and liability risks and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail. Our semiconductors are incorporated into a number of end products, and our business is exposed to product return, warranty and product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail. Although we maintain insurance for product liability claims, the amount and scope of our insurance may not be adequate to cover a product liability claim that is asserted against us. In addition, product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and, in the future, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we are exposed to the product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity affecting our customers. Our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim. We also may suffer a decline in sales from the negative publicity associated with such a lawsuit or with adverse public perceptions in general regarding our customers products. Further, if our products are delivered with impurities or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement costs, and our credibility and the market s acceptance of our products could be harmed.

We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences as a result of changes in, or differences in the interpretation of, applicable tax laws, or the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation. Our company s organizational structure was created in part based on certain interpretations and conclusions regarding various tax laws, including withholding tax and other tax laws of applicable jurisdictions. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding tax laws, however, are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these interpretations and conclusions are incorrect, if our business were to be operated in a way that rendered us ineligible for tax exemptions or caused us to become subject to incremental tax, or if the authorities were to change, modify or have a different interpretation of the relevant tax laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences, and the anticipated benefits of our organizational structure could be materially impaired. Our company s organizational structure and other tax positions are subject to review by tax authorities in the local and other jurisdictions where we operate our business. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be negatively affected by earnings being (i) lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates or (ii) higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be negatively affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to global intangible low-tax income tax laws, transfer pricing adjustments, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign income, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ), which, among other things, implements a 15 alternative minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income of large corporations with average annual financial income exceeding 1 billion, a 1 excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. The IRA provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the OECD s Pillar 2 global corporate minimum tax rate of 15 on companies with revenues of at least EUR 750 million, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2024. Additionally, South Korea became one of the first countries to enact minimum tax rules. At this time, we do not anticipate that changes in the tax laws will have a material impact to our consolidated tax provision for the year ending December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2023. We will continue to monitor as new information and guidance becomes available. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities, including the Korean National Tax Service, with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the U.S. In connection with the OECD s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of income earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Expanded trade restrictions imposed by the United States may limit our ability to sell to certain customers. On August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce expanded the scope of export restrictions as applied to products directed to Huawei and its affiliates listed on the Bureau of Industry and Security s Entity List 
 28 

Table of Contents 

(collectively, Huawei ). While prior restrictions had minimal effect on our ability to supply to customers, the newly expanded restrictions would limit our ability to supply to a variety of customers who we believe incorporate our products to those customers products directly or indirectly sold to Huawei. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are uncertain on the seriousness of the restrictions impact or duration and the future trajectory of our business from customers who directly or indirectly supply Huawei with products that incorporate our products. For export of some of our products, we have successfully obtained the necessary export licenses, and if exports of other products require export licenses due to the restrictions, we will consider applying for the necessary export licenses to continue to sell to the affected customers. Although we have thus far successfully obtained the necessary export licenses for exporting some of our products, we are unsure whether our other applications will be successful. There is also a possibility that export restrictions may be further expanded to target companies in addition to Huawei, which may have an additional impact on our ability to sell to our customers. Export restrictions may also affect our contractors, suppliers or customers, and we cannot assure that they will not violate the restrictions, and any such violations may result in fines or criminal sanctions against us and damage our reputation. Additionally, the U.S. has published significant changes to U.S. export control regulations with respect to Russia and China, and we anticipate additional changes to export control regulations in the future. For example, the U.S. government has implemented controls on advanced computing ICs, computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-users. The new controls expand the scope of foreign-produced items subject to license requirements for certain entities on the U.S. government s Entity List. Future changes in the U.S. export control regulations, including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations, may create delays in the introduction of our products or services in international markets or could prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or services globally. In some cases, such changes could prevent the export or import of our products, which could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Expanded trade restrictions imposed by South Korea may limit our ability to sell to certain customers or engage in any potential strategic opportunities. Under the ITA, any export (including various means of outflow, such as sale or transfer outside Korea) of National Core Technology by MOTIE requires the filing of a prior-report with, and the acceptance of the same by, the MOTIE. Any such export of NCT without the acceptance of the prior-report with the MOTIE may be subject to corrective orders by the relevant authorities, and failure to comply with such corrective orders may potentially result in criminal liabilities. The Notification Regarding Designation of National Core Technologies issued by the MOTIE was amended on July 14, 2021 to add certain technologies to the list of National Core Technology designated by the MOTIE, and the amended list includes the design technology for OLED DDI. In the ordinary course of business, our Korean subsidiary may provide certain information relating to its products, including OLED DDI, to customers, suppliers or vendors, and such disclosure of information may be subject to the NCT-related regulations under the ITA, and therefore the MOTIE s acceptance of prior reports. Since the amendment of the foregoing NCT list in July 2021, we have filed prior-reports with the MOTIE for the export of our OLED DDI product-related information to certain overseas vendors that manufacture our products, and all such reports have thus far been accepted by the MOTIE. There is no assurance, however, that any future prior-reports for the export of our product-related information will be accepted by the MOTIE. In the event that any future prior-report is not accepted, we may be unable to continue our business with the overseas customers, suppliers or vendors, including the manufacturing and delivery of our OLED DDI products. In addition, in the event that there is any M A transaction with respect to our Korean subsidiary that results in non-Korean ownership of 50 or more, or exertion of control over the appointment of officers/management 
 29 

Table of Contents 

by a non-Korean person or entity as the largest shareholder, a prior-report with and the acceptance by the MOTIE is required under the ITA. There is no assurance that any report for an M A transaction involving non-Korean acquirers or investors will be accepted by the MOTIE when such transaction is pursued in the future. Recent changes in international trade policy and the imposition and threats of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Since the beginning of 2018, there have been increasing public threats and, in some cases, legislative or executive action, from U.S. and foreign leaders regarding instituting tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. More specifically, since March of 2018, the U.S. and China have applied tariffs to certain of each other s exports. The institution of trade tariffs globally, and between the U.S. and China specifically, may negatively impact the affected countries economic conditions, which could negatively affect demand for our products in those countries and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations of our customers serving the affected markets. Imposition of tariffs could increase costs of the end-user products we supply that we may not be able to pass on to our customers, which could in turn cause a decrease in the sales of our products and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology and know-how, as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, mask works and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the U.S. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are uncertain and still evolving and historically have not protected, and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement procedures in the U.S. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how through the use of patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other security measures. The process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that, if patents issue, they will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Many of our patents are subject to cross licenses, several of which are with our competitors. Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect these technologies may be breached and may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies. Further, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technologies, even without access to our proprietary technologies. We rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. Our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have no means of knowing what patent applications have been filed until they are published.

In addition, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We may need to file lawsuits to enforce our patents or intellectual property rights, and we may need to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources, and we cannot assure you that we will prevail. Any claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation against use, even those without merit, could require us to: 

pay substantial damages or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they may suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violate the intellectual property rights of others; 

stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of the accused products; 

redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible; 

expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies; 

discontinue processes; or 

obtain licenses to a third party s intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms, or at all. We license certain intellectual property from third parties. The termination of key third-party licenses relating to the use of intellectual property in our products and our design processes would adversely affect certain areas of our business. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses. We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Among them is the Act on Remediation and Compensation for Damages arising from Environmental Contamination which came into effect in Korea on January 1, 2016 and provides for strict liability of business entities in violation of the act and alleviates the burden of proof for the damaged party. Further, under the amendment to the Act on the Control and Aggravated Punishment of Environmental Offenses that becomes effective on November 27, 2020, certain environmental offenses such as illegally emitting specified hazardous air pollutants or emitting air pollutants without necessary permits will be subject to penalties of up to 5 of the sales amount generated from the relevant business. Moreover, to effectively respond to environmental crimes, on November 14, 2022, a joint investigation team was established, consisting of experts from both national and local governments, including the prosecutor s office, the Ministry of Environment. As a result, we have increased potential exposure to liability for environmental contaminations that might have existed in the past or would arise in the future. There can be no assurance that we have been, or will be, in compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws, the failure to comply with new or existing laws, or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations.

Our Korean subsidiary has been designated as a regulated business under Korean environmental law, and such designation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Since 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to K-ETS, a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulations, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government, and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing emissions or purchasing allowances from other participants or the government in the emission trading market. Reduction of our emissions or energy consumption may result in additional and potentially costly compliance or remediation expenses, including potentially the installation of equipment and changes in the type of materials we use in manufacturing, as well as cost of procuring emission allowances to cover the excess emissions, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. During the first implementation period from 2015 to 2017 and second implementation period from 2018 to 2020, we did not exceed the allocated emission amount. Our Korean subsidiary has been allocated emissions allowance in the third implementation period from 2021 to 2025, and we do not expect to exceed the allocated emission amount during the third implementation period. If, however, our Korean subsidiary exceeds the allocated emission amount the third implementation period, we will be required to pay for the excess emissions and may be subject to other regulatory action. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the emissions allowance on a yearly basis. In addition, from time to time, if we assess that we have excess allowances, we may sell such excess allowances to manufacturers in the emission market in Korea. Furthermore, the Korean legislature enacted the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth for Responding to Climate Change (the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act on September 24, 2021. The Carbon Neutrality Framework Act aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35 by 2030 (compared to 2018) and proclaims the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050 as a national vision. The Carbon Neutrality Framework Act is significant in that it legislates carbon neutrality and greenhouse gas reduction objectives, and enables the central administrative agencies, local governments and public institutions to implement various measures towards such objectives. On March 25, 2022, the Enforcement Decree of the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act (the Enforcement Decree was enacted. The Enforcement Decree aims to provide details required for the execution of items prescribed under the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act. The key provisions of the Enforcement Decree include those setting the mid- to long-term greenhouse gas reduction goal at 40 and implementing the climate change impact assessment scheme. It is anticipated that the Carbon Neutrality Framework Act, which aims to promote the harmonious development of the economy and the environment in conjunction with active greenhouse gas reduction measures, will serve as the foundation for the government s climate change response policy going forward. Our compliance with the Serious Accidents Punishment Act (the SAPA could require significant expenditures and management time and expose us to liability for violations. Enacted on January 26, 2021 and effective as of January 27, 2022 in Korea, the SAPA will impose enhanced liability exposure for workplace accidents. The legislative goal of the SAPA is to prevent serious accidents by prescribing punishments and punitive damages liability for business owners or responsible management personnel who have violated safety and health measures in the event of such serious accidents (serious industrial accidents and serious civil accidents). Since the law applies to businesses in Korea with 50 or more full-time employees starting from January 27, 2022, our Korean subsidiary becomes subject to the law after the effective date. According to the SAPA, if a serious occupational accident occurs that results in at least one deceased person, at least two persons wounded for six months or more, or at least three persons suffering from occupational diseases within a one year period, if the business owners or responsible management personnel of the relevant business place is found to have failed to perform its obligation to secure safety and health, that person may be subject to imprisonment for up to 7 year or a fine of up to KRW 100 million (in case of death, imprisonment for not less than 1 year or a fine of not less than KRW 1 billion). Additionally, if there was negligence of the company in giving due attention and supervision to prevent such accident, the company will be 
 32 

Table of Contents 

subject to a fine up to KRW 5 billion under joint penalty provisions. Relevant responsible management personnel will also be required to spend more time, effort and cost to comply with the SAPA and perform the necessary additional duties imposed by the law to ensure compliance. We may need additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may require more capital in the future from equity or debt financings to fund operating expenses, such as research and development costs, finance investments in equipment and infrastructure, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and respond to competitive pressures and potential strategic opportunities. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any additional equity or debt financing would be available to us, or if available, that such financing would be on favorable terms to us. Accordingly, if we are unable to obtain additional capital or our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, and our cash reserves are depleted, we may need to take various actions, such as down-sizing and/or eliminating certain operations, which could include additional exit costs, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, or other restructuring actions. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in taking such actions and, in any event, such actions may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, our indebtedness limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. Our business depends on international customers, suppliers and operations in Asia, and as a result we are subject to regulatory, operational, financial and political risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, suppliers, subcontractors and operations located primarily in Asia. As a result, we face risks inherent in international operations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other market barriers, political, social and economic instability, adverse tax consequences, war, civil disturbances and acts of terrorism, public health issues (including viral outbreaks such as COVID-19), difficulties in accounts receivable collection, extended payment terms and differing labor standards, enforcement of contractual obligations and protection of intellectual property. These risks may lead to increased costs or decreased revenue growth, or both. Our business, results of operations and financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease. As a result of COVID-19, including the emergence of various variants, governments in affected countries have imposed travel bans, quarantines and other emergency public health measures. In response to the virus, national and local governments in numerous countries around the world have implemented substantial business restrictions and lockdown measures and may continue to impose similar policies in the future from time to time in response to further outbreaks of the virus. Private sector companies have also taken precautionary measures, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions and temporarily closing businesses and facilities. These restrictions have had, and these and future prevention and mitigation measures, may continue to have, an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect our future operations. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or 
 33 

Table of Contents 

other alternative work arrangements. Also, some suppliers of materials used in the production of our products may have been or will be more severely impacted by COVID-19, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products. In addition, the severe global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 may cause our customers and end-users of our products to suffer significant economic hardship, which could result in decreased demand for our products in the future and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition (including liquidity) and prospects. The full extent to which COVID-19, or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease, impacts our operations and causes disruptions on our customers, end-users, overall demand for our products, supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of such pandemic, the emergence and characteristics of new variants, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, including the adoption, administration and effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Should such disruptions continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a more severe adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition (including liquidity). Additionally, weaker economic conditions generally could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets, or our ability to raise additional capital, if needed. Tensions with North Korea could have an adverse effect on us and the market value of our shares. Relations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense throughout Korea s modern history. The level of tension between the two Koreas has fluctuated and may increase abruptly as a result of current and future events. In particular, in recent years, there have been heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea s nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs and increased uncertainty regarding North Korea s actions and possible responses from the international community. North Korea s economy also faces severe challenges, and any adverse economic developments may further aggravate social and political tensions within North Korea. Although we do not derive any revenue from, nor sell any products in, North Korea, any future increase in tensions between South Korea and North Korea that may occur, for example, if North Korea experiences a leadership crisis, high-level contacts between South Korea and North Korea break down, or military hostilities occur, could have a material adverse effect on the South Korean economy and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market value of our common stock. We may be subject to disruptions, breaches or cyber-attacks of our secured networks and information technology systems that could damage our reputation, harm our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including IP and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners. Secure maintenance, processing and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We may be subject to disruptions, breaches or cyber-attacks of our secured networks and information technology systems caused by illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error, and our security measures or those of any third party service providers we use may not detect or prevent such security breaches. We may incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities, which could be significant, and our efforts to protect against such breaches or vulnerabilities may not be successful and could result in system interruptions that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, finance or other critical functions. Any such compromise of our information security could also result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or 
 34 

Table of Contents 

other assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business and/or expose us to material monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. You may not be able to bring an action or enforce any judgment obtained in United States courts, or bring an action in any other jurisdiction, against us or our subsidiaries or our directors, officers or independent auditors that are organized or residing in jurisdictions other than the United States. Most of our subsidiaries are organized or incorporated outside of the U.S. and some of our directors and executive officers as well as our independent auditors are organized or reside outside of the U.S. Most of our and our subsidiaries assets are located outside of the U.S. and in particular, in Korea. Accordingly, any judgment obtained in the U.S. against us or our subsidiaries may not be collectible in the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the U.S. upon these persons or to enforce against them or us court judgments obtained in the U.S. that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the U.S. or of the securities laws of any state of the U.S. In particular, there is doubt as to the enforceability in Korea or any other jurisdictions outside the U.S., either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated on the federal securities laws of the U.S. or the securities laws of any state of the U.S. We are a holding company and depend on the business of our subsidiaries to make payments to us. We are a holding company with no independent operations of our own. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of the operations necessary to fund our obligations. Our ability to pay dividends or to make payments on any future obligations will depend on our subsidiaries cash flow and their payment of funds to us. Our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend on: 

their earnings; 

covenants contained in any debt agreements to which we may then be subject, including any debt agreements of our subsidiaries; 

covenants contained in other agreements to which we or our subsidiaries are or may become subject; 

business and tax considerations; and 

applicable law, including any restrictions under Korean law that may be imposed on our Korean subsidiary that would restrict its ability to make payments on intercompany loans from our Dutch subsidiary. We cannot assure that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make distributions or other payments to us. We may at times need to incur impairment, restructuring and other restructuring related charges, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. During industry downturns and for other reasons, we may need to record impairment, restructuring or other restructuring related charges. In the future, we may need to record additional impairment charges or to further restructure our business or incur additional restructuring charges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We are subject to litigation risks, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain. All industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general.

We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving customers, employment and labor and intellectual property. Even if the final outcome of these legal claims does not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, defense and settlement costs can be substantial. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment. The trading price of our common stock might be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could affect the trading price of our common stock may include: 

actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter or year to year; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant agreements, technological innovations or strategic alliances; 

changes in recommendations or estimates by any securities analysts who follow our securities; 

addition or loss of significant customers; 

recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

changes in economic performance or market valuations of competing companies in our industry; 

price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market; 

market conditions in our industry, end markets and the economy as a whole; 

subsequent sales of stock and other financings; and 

litigation, legislation, regulation or technological developments that adversely affect our business. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against the public company. Regardless of its outcome, this type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and a likely diversion of our management s attention. You may not receive a positive return on your investment when you sell your shares, and you could lose some or the entire amount of your investment. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be successfully consummated, or that it will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock. On December 21, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 75.0 million of our outstanding common stock and we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPM to repurchase an aggregate of 37.5 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, we paid JPM 37.5 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 994,695 shares of our common stock. Upon final settlement of the ASR Agreement, we received an additional 1,031,576 shares of common stock from JPM. On August 31, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized an expansion of our previously announced stock repurchase program from 75 million to 87.5 million of our common stock. The remaining 50 million of the expanded 87.5 million program was planned to be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In connection with the repurchase program, we established a stock trading plan with Oppenheimer Co. Inc. in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. The IRA enacted in August 2022 imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market 
 36 

Table of Contents 

value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year. We are assessing the potential impact of the stock repurchase excise tax. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not expect a material impact on our overall share repurchase program or our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Stockholders Equity and Stock-Based Compensation for more information. Significant ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders could adversely affect our other stockholders. The concentration of ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our public stockholders do not view as beneficial. For example, any concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock. Under our certificate of incorporation, our non-employee directors and non-employee holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock do not have a duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar activities or lines of business as those engaged in by us, our subsidiaries and other related parties. Also, we have renounced any interest or expectancy in such business opportunities even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted an opportunity to do so. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware Law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress the price of our common stock. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: 

authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine; 

prohibit action by written consent of our stockholders; 

prohibit any person other than our Board of Directors, the chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or holders of at least 25 of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and 

specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), regulating corporate takeovers and which has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. In general, those provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: 

the transaction is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status; 

upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or 
 37 

Table of Contents 

on or after such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. In general, DGCL Section 203 defines a business combination to include the following: 

any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; 

any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder; 

subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; 

any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or 

the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. In general, DGCL Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any such entity or person. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of, and do not currently intend to opt out of, this provision. We have not historically paid dividends and do not currently have any dividend or distribution policy, and therefore, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. We have not historically paid cash dividends and do not currently have any dividend or distribution policy. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, unless the Board implements a future dividend or distribution policy, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our manufacturing operations take place in a single fabrication facility located in Korea in Gumi. Our facility has a capacity of approximately 36,000 eight-inch equivalent wafers per month. We manufacture wafers utilizing geometries ranging from 0.35 to 0.50 microns. The Gumi facility has one main building with 41,022 square meters devoted to manufacturing, testing and packaging. In addition to our fabrication facility in Gumi, we lease facilities in Cheongju and Seoul, Korea. Each of these facilities includes administration, sales and marketing and research and development functions. We lease sales and marketing offices through our subsidiaries in several other countries. The ownership of our wafer manufacturing assets is an important component of our business strategy. Maintaining manufacturing control enables us to develop proprietary, differentiated products and results in 
 38 

Table of Contents 

higher production yields, as well as shortened design and production cycles. We believe our facilities are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business for the foreseeable future and that we have sufficient production capacity to service our business as currently contemplated without significant capital investment. All of our assembly, test and packaging services for our Display Solutions business and for our Power Solutions business are outsourced with the balance handled in-house. The independent providers of these outsourced services are located in Korea and China. The relative cost of outsourced services, as compared to in-house services, depends upon many factors specific to each product and circumstance. However, we generally incur higher costs for outsourced services, which can result in lower margins. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving customers, employment and labor and intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims, in particular, could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products. We are currently not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report for additional information. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, together in each case with the related notes, included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report. The following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 fiscal year 2022 compared to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 fiscal year 2021 ). A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 fiscal year 2020 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 23, 2022. Overview We are a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor platform solutions for communications, IoT applications, consumer, computing, industrial and automotive applications. We have a proven record with more than 40 years of operating history, a portfolio of approximately 1,100 registered patents and pending applications and extensive engineering and manufacturing process expertise. Our standard products business includes our Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. Our Display Solutions line of products provide flat panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small flat panel displays. These products include source and gate drivers and timing controllers that cover a wide range of flat panel displays used in mobile communications, automotives, entertainment devices, IT applications such as monitors, notebook PCs, tablet PC and TVs applied with liquid crystal display (LCD), organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and Micro light emitting diode (Micro LED) panel. Since 2007, we have designed and manufactured OLED display driver integrated circuit (IC) products. Our current portfolio of OLED solutions address a wide range of resolutions ranging from HD (High Definition) to UHD (Ultra High Definition) for a wide range of applications including smartphones, TVs, automotive and IT applications such as monitors, notebook PCs, tablet PCs as well as AR/VRs. Our Power Solutions business line produces power management semiconductor products including discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing, servers, automotive, and industrial applications. These products include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), AC-DC/DC-DC converters, LED drivers, regulators and power management integrated circuits (PMICs) for a range of devices, including televisions, smartphones, mobile phones, wearable devices, desktop PCs, notebooks, tablet PCs, other consumer electrics, automotive, and industrial applications such as power suppliers, e-bikes, solar inverters, LED lighting and motor drives. Our wide variety of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products combined with our mature technology platform allow us to address multiple high-growth end markets and rapidly develop and introduce new products and services in response to market demands. Our design center and substantial manufacturing operation in Korea place us at the core of the global electronics device supply chain. We believe this enables us to quickly and efficiently respond to our customers needs, and allows us to better serve and capture additional demand from existing and new customers. Certain of our OLED products are produced using external 12-inch foundries. Through a strategic cooperation with external 12-inch foundries, we are managing to ensure outsourcing wafers at competitive price and produce quality products.

To maintain and increase our profitability, we must accurately forecast trends in demand for electronics devices that incorporate semiconductor products we produce. We must understand our customers needs as well as the likely end market trends and demand in the markets they serve. We must also invest in relevant research and development activities and purchase necessary materials on a timely basis to meet our customers demand while maintaining our target margins and cash flow. The semiconductor markets in which we participate are highly competitive. The prices of our products tend to decrease regularly over their useful lives, and such price decreases can be significant as new generations of products are introduced by us or our competitors. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through cost reductions and the introduction of new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to mitigate the risk of losses from product obsolescence. Demand for our products and services is driven by overall demand for communications, IoT, consumer and industrial products and can be adversely affected by periods of weak consumer and enterprise spending or by market share losses by our customers. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatility on our business, we continually strive to diversify our portfolio of products, customers, and target applications. We also expect that new competitors will emerge in these markets that may place increased pressure on the pricing for our products and services. While we believe we are well positioned competitively to compete in these markets and against these new competitors as a result of our long operating history, existing manufacturing capacity and our worldwide customer base, if we are not effective in competing in these markets, our operating results may be adversely affected. Net sales for our standard products business are driven by design wins in which we are selected by an electronics original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or other potential customer to supply its demand for a particular product. A customer will often have more than one supplier designed into multi-source components for a particular product line. Once we have design wins and the products enter into mass production, we often specify the pricing of a particular product for a set period of time, with periodic discussions and renegotiations of pricing with our customers. In any given period, our net sales depend heavily upon the end-market demand for the goods in which our products are used, the inventory levels maintained by our customers and, in some cases, allocation of demand for components for a particular product among selected qualified suppliers. In contrast to completely fabless semiconductor companies, our internal manufacturing capacity provides us with greater control over certain manufacturing costs and the ability to implement process and production improvements for our internally manufactured products, which can favorably impact gross profit margins. Our internal manufacturing capacity also allows for better control over delivery schedules, improved consistency over product quality and reliability and improved ability to protect intellectual property from misappropriation on these internally manufactured products. However, having internal manufacturing capacity exposes us to the risk of under-utilization of manufacturing capacity that results in lower gross profit margins, particularly during downturns in the semiconductor industry. Our standard products business requires investments in capital equipment. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by the design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. Many of these processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment for those products, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. In addition, we are less likely to experience significant industry overcapacity, which can cause product prices to decline significantly. In general, we seek to invest in manufacturing capacity that can be used for multiple high-value applications over an extended period of time. In addition, we outsource manufacturing of those products which do require advanced 
 43

technology and 12-inch and 8-inch wafer capacity, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLED). We believe this balanced capital investment strategy enables us to optimize our capital investments and facilitates more diversified product and service offerings. Since 2007, we had designed and manufactured OLED display driver ICs in our internal manufacturing facilities. As we expanded our design capabilities to products that require lower geometries unavailable at our existing manufacturing facilities, we began outsourcing manufacturing of certain OLED display driver ICs to external 12-inch foundries starting in the second half of 2015 and we have started outsourcing 8-inch wafer for OLED TV IC after the sale of our fabrication facility located in Cheongju, Korea in 2020. This additional source of manufacturing is an increasingly important part of our supply chain management. By outsourcing manufacturing of OLED products to external foundries, we are able to adapt dynamically to changing customer requirements and address growing markets without substantial capital investments by us. However, relying on external foundries exposes us to the risk of being unable to secure manufacturing capacity, particularly under the current global shortage of foundry services. Although we are working strategically with external foundries to ensure long-term wafer capacity, if these efforts are unsuccessful, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our relationship with customers and opportunities to secure new design-wins. Our success going forward will depend upon our ability to adapt to future challenges such as the emergence of new competitors for our products and services or the consolidation of current competitors. Additionally, we must innovate to remain ahead of, or at least rapidly adapt to, technological breakthroughs that may lead to a significant change in the technology necessary to deliver our products and services. We believe that our established relationships and close collaboration with leading customers enhance our awareness of new product opportunities, market and technology trends and improve our ability to adapt and grow successfully. Recent Developments Expanded Stock Repurchase Program On August 31, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an expansion of the previously announced stock repurchase program from 75.0 million to 87.5 million of our common stock. We have already repurchased shares worth 37.5 million under the program through an accelerated stock repurchase agreement on December 21, 2021 with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The remaining 50.0 million of the expanded 87.5 million program has been and will be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In connection with the repurchase program, we have established a stock trading plan with Oppenheimer Co. Inc. in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. From September 2022 to December 2022, we repurchased 1,235,650 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of 12.5 million and a price per share of 10.13 under the stock repurchase program. Global Semiconductor Industry Trends Increases in demand for semiconductor products resulted in a global shortage of manufacturing capacity over the prior two years. As a result, we may experience increased costs to manufacture our products and may not be able to manufacture and deliver all of the orders placed by our customers. Specifically, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacity from the external foundries we rely on, our ability to deliver products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, shortage of manufacturing capacity may lead to an increase in our manufacturing costs. Our principal pricing strategy is to pass on the increased manufacturing costs to our customers; however, we may not be fully able to do this in all cases. Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were severely impacted by these persisting supply shortages, in particular for 28nm

12-inch OLED wafers, which impacted design-in projects from our large panel customer in Korea that are typically given 9 to 12 months in advance. In an effort to minimize the potential adverse impact of the supply shortage, we continue to work strategically with certain external foundries to help ensure long-term wafer capacity. If these efforts are unsuccessful, however, such shortage could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in the future, which would adversely affect our reputation and competitive position, resulting in a negative impact on results of operations. We are not able to foresee when the shortage of manufacturing capacity will subside, but we are beginning to see some indicators of improvement of such supply shortage situation. However, the global shortage for semiconductor products over the prior two years has led to overbooking backordered demand and oversupply. As a result, the current global macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 pandemic, higher inflation and interest rates and uncertainty caused by the Russian-Ukraine war, have led to weaker end-market demand and an oversupply of inventory. We continue to monitor these trends and uncertainties, and any decline in end-market demand and increase in inventory levels could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus causing a disease known as COVID-19 surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in significant disruptions among Chinese manufacturing and other facilities and travel throughout China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Governmental authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have, in some cases, resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures, and may continue to lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the foreseeable future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19. We experienced some minor disruption in our Power Solutions business line from assembly and test subcontractors located in China in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, our external Display Solutions business line contractors and sub-contractors have not been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are, however, unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on future results of operations due to numerous uncertainties. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which, despite progress in vaccination efforts, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as new strains of the virus that may emerge, which may impact rates of infection and vaccination efforts, developments or perceptions regarding the safety of vaccines and the extent and effectiveness of actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact, including vaccination campaigns and lockdown measures, among others. In addition, recurrences or additional waves of COVID-19 cases could cause other widespread or more severe impacts depending on where infection rates are highest. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of our customers and suppliers were to experience prolonged business shutdowns or other disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition, and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this ongoing and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.

Developments in Export Control Regulations On October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations (U.S. Export Regulations), including new restrictions on Chinese entities ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Further, on October 12, 2022, a new rule went into effect requiring U.S. persons to obtain a license prior to engaging in certain activities that could support certain end-uses and end-users, including those related to weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, on October 21, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security brought into effect a series of new Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rules and various new controls on advanced computing items, significantly expanding the scope of items that are subject to export control under the U.S. Export Regulations. Based on our understanding of the current U.S. Export Regulations and related rules, we do not anticipate that they will have a material impact on our business. Additional changes to the U.S. Export Regulations are expected, but the scope or timing of such changes is unknown. We will continue to monitor such developments, including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments. Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income We use the terms Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) in this Report. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation gain, net, (iv) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (v) merger-related income, net and (vi) other charges, net. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. See the footnotes to the table below for further information regarding these items. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance because: 

we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, by eliminating the impact of a number of items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance, provides a more comparable measure of our operating performance from period-to-period and may be a better indicator of future performance; 

we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly requested and used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company as an enterprise level performance measure that eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as other one time or recurring items described above; and 

we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, among other reasons, to assess a company s period-to-period core operating performance and to understand and assess the manner in which management analyzes operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA in a number of ways, including: 

for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; 

to evaluate the effectiveness of our enterprise level business strategies; 

in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance; and 

in certain of our compensation plans as a performance measure for determining incentive compensation payments. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in

this presentation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

(a) 
 This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. 

(b) 
 This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. 

(c) 
 This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in U.S. dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance.

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates the impact of sales of inventories for which excess and obsolete reserves were previously recognized in relation to the U.S. Government s export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, as these reserved inventories were subsequently sold to certain other customers. As this charge and the timing of its reversal meaningfully impacted our operational results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense subject to our ability to foresee and control, we believe our operating performance results are more meaningfully compared if this charge and related reversal are excluded.

(e) 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates 70.2 million income from the recognition of a reverse termination fee as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which was offset in part by a 34.7 million of professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction that was terminated in December 2021. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded.

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, this adjustment eliminates 2.8 million of one-time employee incentives and professional service fees and expenses of 1.0 million incurred in connection with certain strategic evaluations, which was offset in part by a 0.5 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates 3.4 million non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by 1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi, and 0.7 million legal settlement gain related to certain expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with our legacy Fab 4 (which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2020) and awarded in the third quarter of 2021. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; 

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. We present Adjusted Operating Income as supplemental measures of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Operating Income by adjusting operating income (loss) to eliminate the impact of equity-based compensation expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Operating Income is useful to investors to provide a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. Adjusted Operating Income is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with

 This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information.

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates the impact of sales of inventories for which excess and obsolete reserves were previously recognized in relation to the U.S. Government s export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, as these reserved inventories were subsequently sold to certain other customers.

We present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) as a further supplemental measure of our performance. We prepare Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) by adjusting income (loss) to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We present Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) for a number of reasons, including: 

we use Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our consolidated financial performance without the impact of non-cash expenses and the other items as we discussed below since we believe that it is a more consistent measure of our core operating results from period to period; and 

we believe that reporting Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is useful to readers in evaluating our core operating results because it eliminates the effects of non-cash expenses as well as the other items we discuss below, such as foreign currency gains and losses, which are out of our control and can vary significantly from period to period. Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) is not a measure defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We encourage you to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis) differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. We define Adjusted Net Income (including on a per share basis); for the periods indicated as income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) equity-based compensation expense, (ii) foreign currency loss, net, (iii) derivative valuation gain, net, (iv) inventory reserve related to Huawei impact of downstream trade restrictions, (v) merger-related income, net, (vi) other charges, net and (vii) income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments.

(a) 
 This adjustment eliminates the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expenses. Although we expect to incur non-cash equity-based compensation expenses in the future, these expenses do not generally require cash settlement, and, therefore, are not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these non-cash expenses as supplemental information. 

(b) 
 This adjustment mainly eliminates the impact of non-cash foreign currency translation associated with intercompany debt obligations and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as the cash impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses on collection of such receivables and payment of such payables. Although we expect to incur foreign currency translation gains or losses in the future, we believe that analysts and investors will find it helpful to review our operating performance without the effects of these primarily non-cash gains or losses, which we cannot control. Additionally, we believe the isolation of this adjustment provides investors with enhanced comparability to prior and future periods of our operating performance results. 

(c) 
 This adjustment eliminates the impact of gain or loss recognized in income on derivatives, which represents derivatives value changes excluded from the risk being hedged. We enter into derivative transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As our derivative transactions are limited to a certain portion of our expected cash flows denominated in U.S. dollars, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, we do not believe that these charges or gains are indicative of our core operating performance. 

(d) 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates the impact of sales of inventories for which excess and obsolete reserves were previously recognized in relation to the U.S. Government s export restrictions on Huawei, which is a downstream customer of some of our direct customers, as these reserved inventories were subsequently sold to certain other customers. As this charge and the timing of its reversal meaningfully impacted our operational results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating

expense subject to our ability to foresee and control, we believe our operating performance results are more meaningfully compared if this charge and related reversal are excluded.

 For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates 70.2 million income from the recognition of a reverse termination fee as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which was offset in part by a 34.7 million of professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction that was terminated in December 2021. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded.

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, this adjustment eliminates 2.8 million of one-time employee incentives and professional service fees and expenses of 1.0 million incurred in connection with certain strategic evaluations, which was offset in part by a 0.5 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this adjustment eliminates 3.4 million non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by 1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi, and 0.7 million legal settlement gain related to certain expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with our legacy Fab 4 (which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2020) and awarded in the third quarter of 2021. As these adjustments meaningfully impacted our operating results and are not expected to represent an ongoing operating expense or income to us, we believe our operating performance results are more usefully compared if these adjustments are excluded. 

(g) 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments were calculated by calculating the tax expense of each jurisdiction with or without the non-GAAP adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary and the U.S parent entity were 6.2 million and negative 1.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments related to our Korean subsidiary and the U.S parent entity were 2.8 million and 6.9 million, respectively. 

(h) 
 The adjustment for GAAP and cash tax expense difference in connection with the release of valuation allowances will no longer be an adjustment included in this non-GAAP financial measure. The reconciliation for the year ended December 31, 2021 presented above has been recast to reflect the removal of this adjustment in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. We believe that all adjustments to income (loss) used to calculate Adjusted Net Income was applied consistently to the periods presented. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted Net Income does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted Net Income does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and employees; 

Adjusted Net Income does not reflect the costs of holding certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as a measure of profitability of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted Net Income only as a supplement. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Net Sales. We derive substantially all of our sales (net of sales returns and allowances) from our standard products business. We outsource manufacturing of mobile OLED products to external 12-inch foundries. Our 
 52 

Table of Contents 

product inventory is primarily located in Korea and is available for drop shipment globally. Outside of Korea, we maintain limited product inventory, and our sales representatives generally relay orders to our factories in Korea for fulfillment. We have strategically located our sales offices near concentrations of major customers. Our sales offices are located in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Greater China. Our network of authorized agents and distributors is in the U.S., Europe and the Asia Pacific region. We recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon product shipment, delivery at the customer s location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangement. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold products to 175 and 177 customers, respectively, and our net sales to our ten largest customers represented 69 and 80 of our net sales standard products business, respectively. We will provide the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services up to September 1, 2023 at an agreed upon cost plus a mark-up. Gross Profit. Our overall gross profit generally fluctuates as a result of changes in overall sales volumes and in the average selling prices of our products and services. Other factors that influence our gross profit include changes in product mix, the introduction of new products and services and subsequent generations of existing products and services, shifts in the utilization of our manufacturing facility and the yields achieved by our manufacturing operations, changes in material, labor and other manufacturing costs including outsourced manufacturing expenses, and variation in depreciation expense. Average Selling Prices. Average selling prices for our products tend to be highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products. We strive to offset the impact of declining selling prices for existing products through our product development activities and by introducing new products that command selling prices above the average selling price of our existing products. In addition, we seek to manage our inventories and manufacturing capacity so as to preclude losses from product and productive capacity obsolescence. Material Costs. Our material costs consist of costs of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and tape and packaging supplies. We use processes that require specialized raw materials, such as silicon wafers, that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supplies decrease, the costs of our raw materials could increase significantly. Labor Costs. A significant portion of our employees are located in Korea. Under Korean labor laws, most employees and certain executive officers with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 of our employees were eligible for severance benefits. Depreciation Expense. We periodically evaluate the carrying values of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the related depreciation periods. We depreciated our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets. Depreciation rates vary from 30-40 years on buildings to 3 to 12 years for certain equipment and assets. Our evaluation of carrying values is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections. If our projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the related long-lived assets, the carrying value of the assets is impaired and will be reduced, with the reduction charged to expense so that the carrying value is equal to fair value. Selling Expenses. We sell our products worldwide through a direct sales force as well as a network of sales agents and representatives to OEMs, including major branded customers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through distributors. Selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel costs for the members of our 
 53 

Table of Contents 

direct sales force, a network of sales representatives and other costs of distribution. Personnel costs include base salary, benefits and incentive compensation. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of the costs of various corporate operations, including finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions. These expenses primarily consist of payroll-related expenses, consulting and other professional fees and office facility-related expenses. Research and Development. The rapid technological change and product obsolescence that characterize our industry require us to make continuous investments in research and development. Product development time frames vary but, in general, we incur research and development costs one to two years before generating sales from the associated new products. These expenses include personnel costs for members of our engineering workforce, cost of photomasks, silicon wafers and other non-recurring engineering charges related to product design. Additionally, we develop base line process technology through experimentation and through the design and use of characterization wafers that help achieve commercially feasible yields for new products. The majority of research and development expenses of our display business are material and design-related costs for OLED display driver IC product development involving 28-nanometer or finer processes. The majority of research and development expenses of our power business are certain equipment, material and design-related costs for power discrete products and material and design-related costs for power IC products. Power IC uses standard BCD process technologies which can be sourced from multiple foundries. Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations. Historically, a portion of our revenues and cost of sales and greater than the majority of our operating expenses have been denominated in non-U.S. currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in U.S. dollars converted from our non-U.S. revenues and expenses based on monthly average exchange rates, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in U.S. dollars relative to Korean won, depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was 311.0 million. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our stock could be adversely affected. From time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of U.S. dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. Obligations under these foreign currency zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by a counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than 30.0 million at the end of a fiscal quarter unless a waiver is obtained from the counterparty. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations. See Note 10. Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our foreign exchange hedging activities. 
 54 

Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Gain or Loss. Foreign currency translation gains or losses on transactions by us or our subsidiaries in a currency other than our or our subsidiaries functional currency are included in foreign currency gain (loss), net in our statements of operations. A substantial portion of this net foreign currency gain or loss relates to non-cash translation gain or loss related to the principal balance of intercompany balances at our Korean subsidiary that are denominated in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss results from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Korean won and U.S. dollar. Income Taxes. We record our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We exercise significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. We assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets existing at the period-end will be realized in future periods. In such assessment, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would adjust the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. We are subject to income- or non-income-based tax examinations by tax authorities of the U.S., Korea and multiple other foreign jurisdictions for all open tax years. Significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income- or non-income based taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result. Capital Expenditures. We primarily invest in manufacturing equipment, software design tools and other tangible assets mainly for fabrication facility maintenance, capacity expansion and technology improvement. Capacity expansions and technology improvements typically occur in anticipation of increases in demand. We typically pay for capital expenditures in partial installments with portions due on order, delivery and final acceptance. Our capital expenditures mainly include our payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. Inventories. We monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and market expectations. We may be required to take additional charges for quantities in excess of demand, cost in excess of market value and product age. Our analysis may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products, product age, customer design activity, customer concentration and other factors. These forecasts require us to estimate our ability to predict demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels and inventory purchase commitments. Our forecasts for our inventory may differ from actual inventory use.

Revenues Total revenues were 337.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a 136.6 million, or 28.8 , decrease compared to 474.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our standard products business as described below. The standard products business. Net sales from our standard products business were 301.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a 131.2 million, or 30.3 , decrease compared to 433.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net sales from our Display Solutions business line was significantly decreased due primarily to a decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a lower customer demand resulting from a slowdown in the Chinese smartphone market, and a lack of secured manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch OLED wafers) at external 12-inch foundries, which was offset in part by a higher demand for our OLED TV display driver ICs and auto-LCD display driver ICs. The slight increase in net sales from our Power Solutions business line was attributable to a strong demand for power products such as high-end MOSFETs for computing and lighting solutions, and IGBTs mainly for solar inverters, which was offset in part by a lower demand for MOSFETs primarily for smartphones and e-bikes. The transitional Fab 3 foundry services. Net sales from the transitional Fab 3 foundry services were 35.8 million and 41.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross Profit Total gross profit was 101.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a 52.3 million, or 34.0 , decrease. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 30.0 compared to 32.4 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales from our standard products business as further described below. The standard products business. Gross profit from our standard products business was 99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a 50.0 million, or 33.5 , decrease from 149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in net sales from our Display Solutions business line as explained above. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 33.0 compared to 34.5 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to certain inventory reserves and scrap cost related to 12-inch display products resulted from lower demand for China smartphones.

Net sales standard products business in Korea for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased from 113.8 million to 105.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, or by 8.5 million, or 7.5 , primarily due to weaker demand for power products such as MOSFETs, including high-end MOSFETs, primarily for TVs and smartphone applications, which was offset in part by an increase in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs in the first half of 2022 and OLED TV display driver ICs. Net sales standard products business in the Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased from 306.3 million to 179.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, or by 126.8 million, or 41.4 , primarily due to a significant decrease in revenue from our mobile OLED display driver ICs stemming from a lower customer demand resulting from a slowdown in the Chinese smartphone market, and a lack of secured manufacturing capacity (in particular for 28nm 12-inch OLED wafers) at external 12-inch foundries, which was offset in part by a higher demand for power products such as high-end MOSFETs, primarily for computing, and IGBTs mainly for solar inverters. The increased demand for our auto-LCD display driver ICs also favorably affected this year. Net sales standard products business in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased from 6.1 million to 10.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, or by 4.3 million, or 71.3 , primarily due to a change in billing location of a global customer who offers lighting solutions combined with the increase of high-end MOSFET design wins with the customer. Operating Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 50.9 million, or 15.1 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 52.4 million, or 11.1 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of 1.6 million, or 3.0 , was primarily attributable to a net decrease in estimated employee compensation reflecting the current year s financial performance, and a decrease in running royalties recognized based on the sale of certain mobile OLED display driver ICs. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were 52.3 million, or 15.5 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 51.2 million, or 10.8 , of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of 1.1 million, or 2.2 , was primarily attributable to an increase in outside service fees, including those for software design tools. Merger-related Income, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a 70.2 million income from the recognition of a reverse termination fee as a result of the termination of the merger transaction, which 
 58 

Table of Contents 

was offset in part by a 34.7 million of professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the contemplated merger transaction that was terminated in December 2021. Other Charges, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a 2.8 million of one-time employee incentives and professional service fees and expenses of 1.0 million incurred in connection with certain strategic evaluations, which was offset in part by a 0.5 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a 3.4 million of non-recurring professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with the regulatory requests, which was offset in part by a 1.4 million gain on sale of certain legacy equipment of the closed back-end line in our fabrication facility in Gumi. Operating Income (Loss) As a result of the foregoing, operating loss of 5.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to operating income of 83.4 million the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in operating income of 88.7 million resulted primarily from a 52.3 million decrease in gross profit and a 35.5 million net decrease in merger-related income. Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income was 6.0 million and 2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The increase of 3.4 million, or 129.2 , was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary, which benefited from the favorable financial market environment. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 1.2 million and 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Foreign Currency Loss, Net. Net foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.0 million compared to net foreign currency loss of 11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net foreign currency losses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were due to the depreciation in the value of the Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar during each period. A substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain or loss is non-cash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in U.S. dollars, and is affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interest between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was 311.0 million and 344.4 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation gain or loss from intercompany balances were included in determining our consolidated net income since the intercompany balances were not considered long-term investments in nature because management intended to settle these intercompany balances at their respective maturity dates. Others, Net. Others were comprised of rental income and gains and losses from valuation of derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments. Others, net for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0.6 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Others, net for the year ended December 31, 2021, included a 0.7 million legal settlement gain related to certain expenses incurred in prior periods in connection with our legacy Fab 4 (which was sold during the year ended December 31, 2020) and awarded in the third quarter of 2021. Income Tax Expense We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing tax rates.

We recorded a 5.2 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is primarily composed of income tax expense from our Korean subsidiary due mainly to its realized foreign currency gains resulting in taxable income for the year, and this expense was partially offset by income tax benefit from our Dutch subsidiary. The Dutch subsidiary s tax benefit was mainly attributable to the reversal of withholding tax with respect to the waiver of the accrued interest on the loans granted to our Korean subsidiary by our Dutch subsidiary. We recorded a 17.3 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was primarily composed of the income tax expense of 6.9 million from our Korean subsidiary, primarily due to its taxable income for the year, and the income tax expense of 8.2 million from the parent entity in the U.S. The U.S. parent s tax expense was mainly attributable to the recognition of income and expenses related to the Merger combined with the utilization of its available net operating loss carry-forwards. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the foregoing, net loss of 8.0 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net income of 56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As discussed above, the 64.7 million decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an 88.7 million decrease in operating income, which was offset in part by a 12.1 million decrease in income tax expense, an 8.8 million improvement in net foreign currency loss and a 3.4 million increase in interest income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal capital requirements are to fund sales and marketing, invest in research and development and capital equipment, and to fund working capital needs. We calculate working capital as current assets less current liabilities. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our financing activities. Our ability to manage cash and cash equivalents may be limited, as our primary cash flows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, we may sell accounts receivable to third parties under factoring agreements or engage in accounts receivable discounting to facilitate the collection of cash. In addition, from time to time, we may make payments to our vendors on extended terms with their consent. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any accounts payable on extended terms or payment deferment with our vendors. As of June 29, 2018, our Korean subsidiary entered into an arrangement whereby it (i) acquired a water treatment facility from SK hynix for 4.2 million to support our fabrication facility in Gumi, Korea, and (ii) subsequently sold the water treatment facility for 4.2 million to a third party management company that we engaged to run the facility for a 10-year term beginning July 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding obligation of this arrangement is approximately 24.8 million for remaining service term through 2028. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents held by our Korean subsidiary were 207.9 million, which represents 92 of our total cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis. We currently believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves from cash on hand and expected cash from operations to fund our operations as well as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 225.5 million, a 54.1 million decrease compared to 279.5 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash inflow provided by operating activities totaled 5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 87.7 million of cash inflow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The net operating cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects our net loss of 8.0 million, as adjusted favorably by 57.6 million, which mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization, provision for severance benefits, net foreign currency loss and stock-based compensation, and net unfavorable impact of 44.4 million from changes of operating assets and liabilities. Our working capital balance as of December 31, 2022 was 290.6 million compared to 323.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The 33.0 million decrease was primarily attributable to a 54.1 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a 18.0 million decrease in other receivables mainly resulted from receipt of reverse termination fee, which was offset in part by a 19.6 million decrease in accounts payable, a 10.4 million decrease in accrued expenses and a 4.9 million increase in advance payments to certain suppliers, including external foundries to meet our planned production. Cash outflow used in investing activities totaled 24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a 31.4 million of cash outflow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 6.5 million decrease in cash outflow was attributable to an 8.8 million decrease in purchase of property, plant and equipment, which was offset in part by a 1.9 million net increase in hedge collateral and a 0.9 million decrease in proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Cash outflow used in financing activities totaled 12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 35.5 million of cash outflow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a payment of 12.1 million for the repurchases of our common stock in 2022 pursuant to our stock repurchase program and a payment of 1.8 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by 1.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. The financing cash outflow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to a payment of 37.5 million for accelerated stock repurchase program and a payment of 1.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which was offset in part by 4.3 million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. We routinely make capital expenditures for fabrication facility maintenance, enhancement of our existing facility and reinforcement of our global research and development capability. For the year ended December 31, 2022, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were 23.4 million, an 8.8 million, or 27.4 , decrease from 32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were related to meeting our customer demand and supporting technology and facility improvement at our fabrication facility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical due to the fact that they involve a high degree of judgment and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first in, first out method FIFO ). If net realizable value is less than cost at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is reduced to the realizable value, and the difference is recognized as a loss on valuation of inventories within cost of sales. Inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than costs due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels, or other causes based on individual facts and circumstances. We evaluate the sufficiency of inventory reserves and take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product age and other factors. Reserves are also established for excess inventory based on our current inventory levels and projected demand and our ability to sell those specific products. Situations that could cause these inventory reserves include a decline in business and economic conditions, decline in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decline in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and consumer requirements, or failure to estimate end customer demand properly. A reduction of these inventory reserves may be recorded if previously reserved items are subsequently sold as a result of unexpected changes to certain aforementioned situations. The gross amount of inventory reserves charged to cost of sales totaled 13.3 million and 7.6 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The new cost base related to the sale of inventory that was previously written down totaled 3.6 million and 5.3 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As prescribed in ASC 330, Inventory, once a reserve is established for a particular item based on our assessment as described above, it is maintained until the related item is sold or scrapped as a new cost basis has been established that cannot subsequently be marked up. In addition, the cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of each fabrication facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a certain level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per production unit which exceed those under normal capacity are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We make an ongoing assessment of our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, expiration of tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards and tax planning strategies. Then, if necessary, we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets in order for the net amount of deferred tax assets to be recorded only to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets. We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and 
 62 

Table of Contents 

accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provisions for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to the market risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market conditions, primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the normal course of our business, we are subject to market risks associated with currency movements on our assets and liabilities. Foreign Currency Exposures We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net income from our subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, as our foreign subsidiaries in Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan and Hong Kong use local currency as their functional currency. From time to time these subsidiaries have cash and financial instruments in local currency. The amounts held in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China are not material in regards to foreign currency movements. However, based on the cash and financial instruments balance at December 31, 2022 for our Korean subsidiary, a 10 devaluation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease of 0.7 million in our U.S. dollar financial instruments and cash balances. See Note 10. Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates on Reported Results of Operations for additional information regarding our foreign exchange hedging activities.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated 

financial statements ). 

We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework

 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , 

and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework

 Basis for Opinions 

The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated 

financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated 

financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets

As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has net deferred tax assets of 38.3 million, including a valuation allowance of 84.6 million, as of December 31, 2022. Management determines deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires management to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors, including historical operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, the Company s ability to generate future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of deferred tax assets, including the application of tax law to the projected tax calculation and a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the estimates of future taxable income, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s estimates of future taxable income, (iii) auditor judgment in assessing management s application of tax law to the projected tax calculation, and (iv) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Table of Contents 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management s calculation used, (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used in the calculation, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used in the calculation of future taxable income. Evaluating management s assumptions related to estimates of future taxable income involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) current and past profitability, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management s assumptions and calculation for assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, including the mechanics and application of tax law to the projected tax calculation.

million in cash, pursuant to the terms of a business transfer agreement (the Business Transfer Agreement dated March 31, 2020 by and among the Company and Magnus Semiconductor, LLC, a Korean limited liability company Magnus ). The purchase price was paid in a combination of U.S. Dollars in the amount of million and Korean Won in the amount of approximately KRW billion. In addition to the purchase price, the Buyer assumed all severance liabilities relating to the transferred employees, which had a value of approximately million. The Buyer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Magnus, which was established by Alchemist Capital Partners Korea Co., Ltd. and Credian Partners, Inc. On April 20, 2020, Magnus assigned, and the Buyer assumed, all rights and obligations of Magnus under the Business Transfer Agreement. This divestiture of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 was made in connection with the Company s strategic shift of its operational focus to its standard products business. The Foundry Services Group was historically a reportable segment. The Foundry Services Group business was classified as discontinued operations in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for the 2020 fiscal year. Accordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, its standard products business, together with transitional foundry services associated with its fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as Fab 3, that it expects to perform for the Buyer for a period of up to three years from the Closing Date (the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services ). 
 The Company s standard products business includes its Display Solutions and Power Solutions business lines. The Company s Display Solutions products provide panel display solutions to major suppliers of large and small rigid and flexible panel displays, and a wide range of applications including smartphones, TVs, automotive and IT applications such as monitors, notebook PCs, tablet PCs as well as AR/VRs. The Company s Power Solutions products include discrete and integrated circuit solutions for power management in communications, consumer, computing, servers, automotive, and industrial applications.

recorded using the interest method. The amortization and interest expense are recorded separately in the consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of operating lease right-of-use

 assets and interest expense on operating lease liabilities are recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. 
 An extension or contraction of a lease term is considered if the related option to extend or early terminate the lease is reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company. Operating lease right-of-use

 assets may also include any advance lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease
 components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, lease and non-lease
 components are accounted for as a single lease component. 
 Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates are not included in the right-of-use

 assets or liabilities. These variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. 
 The Company does not recognize operating lease right-of-use

of all employees of the Company were eligible for severance benefits. 
 Beginning in July 2018, the Company began contributing to certain severance insurance deposit accounts a percentage of severance benefits, which may be adjusted from time to time, accrued for eligible employees for their services beginning January 1, 2018 pursuant to Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act of Korea. These accounts consist of time deposits and other guaranteed principal and interest accounts, and are maintained at insurance companies, banks or security companies for the benefit of the Company s employees. 

Accrued severance benefits were partly funded through a group severance insurance plan. The amounts funded under this insurance plan were classified as a reduction of the accrued severance benefits. 

In accordance with the National Pension Act of the Republic of Korea, a certain portion of accrued severance benefits was deposited with the National Pension Fund and deducted from the accrued severance benefits. The contributed amount is paid to employees from the National Pension Fund upon their retirement. 

In addition, the Company offers sales returns (other than those that relate to defective products under warranty), cash discounts for early payments and sales incentives, and certain allowances to the Company s customers, including the Company s distributors. The Company records reserves for those returns, discounts, incentives and allowances as a deduction from sales, based on historical experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors. 

All amounts billed to a customer related to shipping and handling are classified as sales while all costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. The amounts charged to selling, general and administrative expenses were thousand, thousand and thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Of the recorded deferred revenue of thousand as of December 31, 2021 and thousand as of December 31, 2020, thousand and thousand were recognized as revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

being hedged. If the Company determines that a derivative instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, it discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in current earnings. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter. The Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. 

In accordance with ASC 815, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative instruments that do not qualify, or cease to qualify, as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the adjustments are recorded through net income or loss. 

The cash flows from derivative instruments receiving hedge accounting treatment are classified in the same categories as the hedged items in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Diluted earnings per share reflect the dilution of potential common stock outstanding during the period including stock options and restricted stock units, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units), and convertibles, using the if-converted
 method. In determining the hypothetical shares repurchased, the Company uses the average share price for the period. In the case that earnings are negative, any potential common stock equivalents would have the effect of being anti-dilutive in the computation of net loss per share.

() Commencing in March 2012, the Company has been a party to an agreement to sell selected trade accounts receivable to a financial institution from time to time. After a sale, the Company does not retain any interest in the receivables and the applicable financial institution collects these accounts receivable directly from the customer. There were sale of accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of operating cash flows. 

The Company uses receivable discount programs with certain customers. These discount arrangements allow the Company to accelerate collection of customers receivables.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, a permanent difference of 
thousand was included as Global intangible low-taxed
 income GILTI in the U.S., which was primarily attributable to the income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company, including its Korean subsidiary. The permanent tax expense of thousand related to intercompany debt restructuring recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 was derived from the waiver and release of unpaid interests of the intercompany loans granted to the Korean subsidiary by the Dutch subsidiary. In connection with the waiver of unpaid interests, the related withholding tax was reversed, resulting in the recognition of income tax benefit of thousand. 
 The income tax benefit of thousand was due to the changes in valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2022, of which thousand related to the release of valuation allowances related to the U.S parent company s current year earnings, which was mainly driven by GILTI inclusion. The remaining thousand represented the release of valuation allowances based on the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years.

thousand was included in the state net operating loss write-off
 in 2021, resulting in no income tax effect in the year. The Company s parent entity in the U.S. is no longer subject to state income taxes in 2022 and thereafter. The remaining thousand represented the release of valuation allowances based on the assessment of the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future tax years. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, a permanent difference of thousand was included as GILTI in the U.S., and was primarily attributable to the income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company, including its Korean subsidiary, from the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4. 
 The income tax benefit of thousand was due to the changes in valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which thousand related to the release of valuation allowances related to the Company s current year earnings, which were mainly driven by GILTI inclusion at the U.S. parent company. The remaining thousand represented the release of valuation allowances based on the realizability of the related deferred tax assets in future years. The Company s operating subsidiary in Korea had generated three years of cumulative profits adjusted for permanent differences and anticipated to generate taxable basis for the subsequent years. As a result, thousand of valuation allowances, established against the Korean subsidiary s deferred tax assets, were released as of December 31, 2020. 
 Of the permanent tax expense of thousand related to intercompany debt restructuring recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, thousand related to the waiver and release of unpaid interests of the intercompany loans granted to the Korean subsidiary by the Dutch subsidiary. This transaction created taxable income for the Korean subsidiary, but did not result in a liability because of the utilization of loss carryforwards, which were used against income from cancellation of intercompany loans.

The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability related to outside basis differences inherent in its foreign subsidiaries because the investments in those foreign subsidiaries within the group are essentially permanent in duration or earnings in foreign subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred income taxes not recorded that are associated with those outside basis differences. If circumstances change and it becomes apparent that the undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will be remitted or the parent entity will dispose of its interest in the subsidiaries in the foreseeable future, and related income taxes have not been recognized by the parent entity, the parent entity will accrue as an expense of the current period income taxes attributable to that remittance or disposition.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Principal Financial Officer ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management of the Company, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. (b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on our assessment, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Samil PricewaterhouseCoopers, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Report. (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.1 
 DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 
 The following brief description of the capital stock of Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation us , our , we ,
or the Company is a summary. This summary is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of our Certificate of Incorporation Certificate of Incorporation ), and our Amended
and Restated Bylaws Bylaws previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this
Exhibit 4.1 forms a part. We encourage you to read the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws carefully. General 
 The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company may issue 155,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 150,000,000 shares are
designated as common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and 5,000,000 shares are designated as of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. Common
Stock Voting Rights Holders of
our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Except as required by law or our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any meeting at which a quorum is present will be sufficient for the transaction of any business at a meeting. 
 Dividends Subject to preferences held
by, or that may be granted to, any outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive ratably those dividends as may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for such
distributions, as well as any other distributions made to our stockholders. Other Rights 
 In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets
remaining after we pay our liabilities and any liquidation preferences granted to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. 
 Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or other subscription or conversion rights. 
 There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. 
 Preferred Stock The Certificate of
Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is
empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. The preferred stock could
be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law 
 We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL ), regulating corporate
takeovers and which has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common
stock. In general, those provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder,
unless: 

the transaction is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that
status; 
 1 

upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the
interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or 

on or after such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting
of stockholders, and not by written consent, by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 In general, DGCL Section 203 defines a business combination to include the following: 

any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; 

any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of the assets of the corporation involving the
interested stockholder; 

subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any
stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; 

any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock
of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or 

the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other
financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. In general, DGCL Section 203 defines an interested
stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any such entity or person. 
 A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision. Certain Provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Among other things, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws: 

authorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as our
board of directors may determine; 

prohibit action by written consent of our stockholders; 

prohibit any person other than our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our Chief
Executive Officer or holders of at least 25 of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and

specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. 
 Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MX. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar The
transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC.
