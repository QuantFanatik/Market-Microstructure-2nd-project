ITEM 1. 
 
 Business 

 STAAR Surgical Company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells implantable lenses for the eye and delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. We are the leading manufacturer of lenses used worldwide in corrective or refractive surgery. We have been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 40 years. Our goal is to position our refractive lenses throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. We also make lenses for use in surgery that treats cataracts. Unless the context indicates otherwise, we, us, the Company, and STAAR refer to STAAR Surgical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 A glossary explaining many of the technical terms used in this report begins on page 15. The reader may also find it helpful to refer to the discussion of the structure and function of the human eye that begins on page 7. 
 Operations 
 STAAR has significant operations globally. Activities outside the United States (U.S.) accounted for 95 of our total sales in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the pacing of product approvals and commercialization that tend to occur first outside the United States. STAAR sells its products in more than 75 countries, with direct distribution (i.e., via STAAR representatives) in Japan, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Singapore, Canada, and the U.K., with a combination of direct distribution and independent distribution (i.e., via distributors and STAAR representatives) in China, Korea, India, France, Benelux, and Italy, and with independent distribution in the remainder of the countries where we sell. 
 STAAR maintains operational and administrative facilities in the U.S., Switzerland, and Japan. Its current global operations are as follows: 

United States. STAAR operates its global administrative offices and principal manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California. The Monrovia manufacturing facility primarily makes the Visian implantable Collamer lens product family, including the EVO Visian ICL (collectively referred to as ICLs), preloaded silicone cataract intraocular lenses (IOLs), and injector systems. We manufacture the raw material for Collamer lenses in our facility in Aliso Viejo, California. STAAR also operates a Technology Center housing its Research & Development team and labs in Tustin, California. STAAR s facility in Lake Forest, California serves as our corporate headquarters. It contains executive offices and operational facilities we expect to use for future manufacturing of STAAR s Presbyopia lenses, EVO Viva . 

Switzerland . STAAR operates an administrative, distribution and operational facility in Brugg, Switzerland under its wholly owned subsidiary, STAAR Surgical AG. We are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capabilities for STAAR s ICL products in our Nidau, Switzerland facility. 

Japan . STAAR operates administrative and distribution facilities in Japan under its wholly owned subsidiary, STAAR Japan Inc. STAAR Japan s administrative facility is in Shin-Urayasu and its distribution facility is in Ichikawa City. STAAR performs final packaging of its silicone preloaded IOL injectors and final inspection of its acrylic preloaded cataract IOL injectors at the Ichikawa City facility. 

 We also maintain commercial offices in China, Germany, Spain, India, Singapore, and the U.K.

 Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 
 100 of the Company s sales are generated from the ophthalmic surgical product segment and, therefore, the Company operates as one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Company s principal products are ICLs used in refractive surgery. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about product lines and operations in geographic areas. 
 Principal Products 
 In designing our products, we seek to delight patients and surgeons by: 

Improving patient outcomes 

Minimizing patient risk and 

Simplifying ophthalmic procedures and post-operative care for the surgeon and the patient. 

 EVO Visian ICL and EVO Viva ICL. Refractive surgery corrects visual disorders that eyeglasses or contact lenses have traditionally treated (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia). The field of refractive surgery includes both lens-based procedures, using products like our ICL, and laser-based procedures like LASIK. The ICL product line treats a wide range of refractive errors within commonly known vision disorders such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism and presbyopia. 
 The ICL folds for minimally invasive implantation behind the iris and in front of the natural crystalline lens, using techniques similar to those used to implant an IOL during cataract surgery, except that the natural lens remains intact in the eye. Lenses of this type are generically called phakic IOLs or phakic implants because they work along with the patient s natural lens, or phakos , rather than replacing it. The surgeon typically implants the ICL using topical anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The patient usually experiences immediate vision improvement within a day. 
 Our ICL is the only posterior chamber phakic IOL (PIOL) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing and sale in the U.S., and we believe it is the world s largest selling phakic IOL. Our biocompatible Collamer material belongs to a family of materials known as collagen copolymers. Collagen copolymers are compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. The proprietary Collamer material is exclusive to us. We believe that the biocompatibility of the Collamer material used for the ICL product line is a significant factor in the ability to place this lens safely in the posterior chamber of the eye. 
 STAAR has sold more than 2,000,000 ICLs worldwide. STAAR began selling the ICL for myopia for use outside the U.S. in 1997. U.S. sales commenced in 2006. In September 2011, STAAR launched the ICL with CentraFLOW technology, commonly known as EVO ICL, which uses a port in the center of the ICL optic in markets outside the U.S. The port is of a size intended to optimize the flow of fluid within the eye without affecting the quality of vision. The central port also eliminates the need for the surgeon to perform a YAG peripheral iridotomy procedure days before the ICL implant. The CentraFLOW technology makes the visual outcomes of the ICL available through a relatively quick and comfortable surgical implantation experience. We are authorized to sell the EVO ICL in all countries where we sell our ICL family of lenses. In December 2015, we received the CE Mark for EVO+, an ICL with CentraFLOW technology and an expanded optical zone of up to 20 . We believe the expanded optical zone may further improve certain patients visual experience, thus making the ICL increasingly desirable for both patients and ophthalmic surgeons. We are authorized to sell the EVO+ in the following regions: the approximately 31 countries that require the European Union CE Mark, Korea, Japan, India, Canada, the U.S., Hong Kong, Turkey, and several countries in the Middle East. In March 2022, the FDA granted approval of the EVO and EVO+ Visian Implantable Collamer Lens for the correction of myopia and myopia with astigmatism. The Hyperopic ICL, which treats far-sightedness, is sold primarily in countries that require the European Union CE Mark. In July 2020, we received the CE Mark for EVO Viva , a presbyopia-correcting ICL with an aspheric EDOF optic. We commenced certifying surgeons located in countries that recognize the CE Mark to implant the EVO Viva lens. The EVO Viva lens adds near and intermediate vision correction for patients with presbyopia. We believe the EVO Viva lens will assist certain patients with eliminating the burdens of reading glasses or frequent replacement contact lenses. Typically, ICL surgery is an elective procedure paid for or financed by the patient. 
 Globally, the ICL is available for myopia and hyperopia and is available in multiple models, powers and lengths totaling hundreds of different types of inventoried lenses. This requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory 
 3 
 
 to meet customer preference for rapid delivery. The Toric ICL (TICL), which also corrects for astigmatism, is available for myopia in the same powers and lengths and carries additional parameters of cylinder and axis. The EVO Viva lens is available for myopia in the same powers and lengths and carries additional parameters relating to presbyopia correction. 
 According to Market Scope, LLC a publisher of ophthalmic industry data, approximately 4.7 million refractive procedures, primarily laser vision procedures, were expected to be performed worldwide in 2022. The incidence of myopia is growing globally, with high myopia becoming more common according to recently published articles, affecting nearly 5 billion and 1 billion people, respectively, by 2050 (Global Prevalence of Myopia and High Myopia and Temporal Trends from 2000 through 2050, Ophthalmology, Vol. 123, No. 5, May 2016 Global trends in myopia management attitudes and strategies in clinical practice, Contact Lens and anterior Eye, Vol. 39, 2016 ). We believe this will result in a significantly increased number of patients seeking refractive procedures. We believe that over the past decade negative publicity regarding LASIK has reduced patient interest in the LASIK procedure. The ICL is a lens-based refractive procedure (unlike LASIK) with over 2,000,000 ICLs sold to date. Surgeons have published over 100 peer-reviewed articles with clinical data regarding the safety, effectiveness, and visual quality of the ICL. We believe the ICL provides a safe and effective solution for the growing number of myopic patients who will seek visual freedom from eyeglasses and contact lenses. 
 We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical needs and to address the increasing demands of our customers. As part of our sales and marketing efforts, we attend and participate in major ophthalmic conventions around the world and invest in market development, practice support, healthcare professional training and patient outreach. We have started working more closely with leading refractive clinics in the area of training, product awareness and practice development. Our marketing programs seek to position the ICL as a premium and primary option for appropriate patients at the clinic and via digital and social media. Since the second half of 2022, we have announced our partnerships with singer, songwriter, and actor, Joe Jonas, professional basketball player, Max Strus, as well as actress and beauty entrepreneur Peyton List, to raise awareness of the EVO ICL lens. 
 Sales of ICLs (including EVO+ and TICLs) accounted for approximately 95 of our total sales in fiscal 2022, 92 of our total sales in fiscal 2021 and 87 of our total sales in fiscal 2020. 
 Other Products 
 Intraocular Lenses (IOLs). We sell in parts of Asia and parts of Europe a Preloaded Injector with an acrylic IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector ready for use in cataract surgery. We also sell a silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector in Japan. The acrylic lens-based Preloaded Injector uses a lens supplied by a third party. The supplier also assembles and sells the acrylic Preloaded Injector under its own brand, using injector parts purchased from us. The silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector uses a lens produced and marketed by STAAR. 
 In most of the countries where STAAR sells cataract IOLs, government agencies reimburse most or all of the cost of cataract surgery and IOLs. Government agencies continue to reduce the reimbursement rates for cataract surgery and IOLs. In response, over the past several years we have rationalized our low margin cataract IOLs. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we decided to phase out our nanoFLEX IOL, a single piece aspheric cataract IOL and to only sell our silicone lens-based Preloaded Injector in Japan. Also, as a result of third-party materials and supply chain challenges that affect our Preloaded Injectors, we will no longer be able to manufacture that device. We will continue to support customers of all our Other Products through the end of 2023. We do not expect to offer for sale our IOLs used in cataract surgery thereafter. 
 Sales of cataract IOLs accounted for approximately 3 of our total sales in fiscal 2022, 6 of our total sales in fiscal 2021 and 8 of our total sales in fiscal 2020. 
 Other Surgical Products. We sell injector parts to our acrylic lens supplier for their preloaded acrylic cataract IOL that they sell under their own brand. Also, we sell other related instruments and devices that we manufacture, or that are manufactured by others. Generally, these products have lower overall gross profit margins relative to our ICLs and cataract IOLs. As noted above, as a result of third-party materials and supply chain challenges, we will no longer be able to manufacture certain Other Products. We will continue to support customers of all our Other Products through the end of 2023. We do not expect to offer for sale any of our Other Products thereafter. Other Products sales also include normal recurring sales adjustments such as sales return allowances. Sales of Other Surgical Products accounted for approximately 2 of our total sales in fiscal 2022, 2 of our total sales in fiscal 2021 and 5 of our total sales in fiscal 2020.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 STAAR uses a wide range of raw materials in the production of its ICL family of products. STAAR purchases most of the raw materials and components from external suppliers. Some of our raw materials are single-sourced due to regulatory constraints, cost effectiveness, availability, quality, and vendor reliability issues. Many of our components are standard parts or materials and are available from a variety of sources. We do not typically pursue regulatory and quality certification of multiple sources of supply. 
 Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 
 We strive to protect our investment in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products through the use of patents, trademarks, licenses, trade secrets, and copyrights. We own or have rights to a number of patents, licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property related and important to our business. As of December 30, 2022, we owned approximately 61 United States and foreign patents and had 19 patent applications pending. We rely more on trade secrets than patents and believe that no particular patent is so important that its loss or expiration would materially adversely affect our operations as a whole. 
 Our intellectual property generally relates to the design, production, and manufacture of the Collamer lens material and related materials, ICLs and related lenses, and lens delivery systems for folding intraocular lenses (injectors and cartridges, both stand-alone and preloaded) used with ICLs. We believe it would require extensive time and effort for a competitor to duplicate our intellectual property and processes to develop a product with comparable capabilities to our ICL family of products. 
 Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks we consider to be important to our business. STAAR , EVO Visian ICL , EVO Viva , Evolution in Visual Freedom , Visian , Collamer , CentraFLOW , and AquaPORT , are trademarks or registered trademarks of STAAR in the U.S., the European Union, or other countries. The scope and duration of trademark protection varies widely throughout the world. In some countries, trademark protection continues only as long as the mark is used. Other countries require registration of trademarks and the payment of registration fees. Trademark registrations are generally for fixed but renewable terms. 
 We protect our proprietary technology, in part, through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties. Our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to STAAR, without additional consideration, inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by STAAR, subject to customary exceptions. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or other terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
 Seasonality 
 While certain individual markets may be impacted by seasonal trends on a quarterly basis, in the aggregate, seasonality does not materially affect our sales. 
 Working Capital Requirements 
 There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that have a material adverse effect on our working capital. 
 Distribution and Customers 
 We market our products to a variety of health care providers, including ophthalmic surgeons, vision centers, surgical centers, hospitals, government facilities, and distributors. The primary user of our products is an ophthalmologist. 
 We sell our products directly through our own sales representatives in Japan, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Singapore, Canada, and the U.K. We sell through a combination of our own representatives and independent distributors in China, Korea, India, France, Benelux, and Italy. We sell through independent distributors in other countries. Our products are sold in more than 75 countries worldwide. We maintain a global marketing team, as well as regional marketing personnel to support the promotion and sale of our products. The global marketing department supports selling efforts by developing and providing promotional materials, speakers programs, digital and social media sites, participation in trade shows and technical presentations. Where we distribute products 
 5 
 
 directly, we rely on local sales representatives to help generate sales by promoting and demonstrating our products with physicians. Our clinical affairs personnel provide training and educational courses globally. 
 One customer, Shanghai Lansheng, our China distributor who sells into China and Hong Kong, accounted for approximately 52 of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2022. Net sales to Shanghai Lansheng during each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:

Backlog 
 We generally keep sufficient inventory on hand to ship product immediately or shortly after receipt of an order. The ICL is manufactured to address refractive prescriptions across a broad range of correction, resulting in a large number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). The challenge of maintaining inventory in all models can result in a backlog in customer orders. In 2022, COVID-19 related issues and other production output challenges had a less significant impact than in prior years and we did not incur any significant backlog for any quarter during 2022. We continue to focus on meeting the significant level of demand for our ICL lenses and achieving standard inventory level requirements in 2023. 
 Government Contracts 
 No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of any particular contract or subcontract at the election of the U.S. Government. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the ophthalmic surgical product market is intense and is primarily driven by technological innovation and the regulatory approval required to commercialize products in the key markets around the world. The development of new or improved products may make existing products less attractive, reduce them to commodity status or even make them obsolete. To remain competitive, companies such as STAAR must devote continued efforts and significant financial resources to enhance their existing products and to develop new products. 
 In the refractive market, our ICL technology competes with other elective surgical procedures such as laser vision correction (e.g., LASIK) for those consumers who are looking for an alternative to eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct their vision. In the cataract surgery market, our IOLs primarily compete based on our technology s quality and value. 
 We believe our primary competition in selling the ICL to patients seeking surgery to correct refractive conditions lies not in similar products to the ICL, but in laser surgical procedures. Alcon (formerly a part of Novartis), Johnson & Johnson (formerly Advanced Medical Optics or AMO), Bausch Health Companies (formerly Valeant, Bausch & Lomb or B+L), and Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, all market lasers for corneal refractive surgery and promote their sales worldwide. 
 Phakic implants that compete with the ICL are also available in the marketplace. The two principal types of phakic IOLs are (1) posterior chamber designs like the ICL, and (2) iris clip anterior chamber PIOLs like the Artisan and Artiflex lenses made by Ophtec. We believe the ICL has compelling clinical advantages over the other lenses, which are reflected in our strong market share of the global phakic IOL market. The ICL is the only foldable, minimally invasive posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens approved for sale in the U.S. In addition, competitors from Asia are beginning to appear in the market with their low-cost version of a posterior chamber implantable contact lens, increasing the level of competition. 
 The global cataract IOL market is highly concentrated, with the top five competitors (Alcon, Johnson & Johnson, Hoya, Bausch & Lomb and Carl Zeiss Meditec) combined accounting for approximately 66 of total market revenue, according to Market Scope reports.

The Human Eye 
 The following discussion provides background information on the structure, function, and some of the disorders of the human eye to enhance the reader s understanding of our products described in this report. The human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of receiving visual images and transmitting them to the visual center in the brain. The eye has an anterior segment and a posterior segment that are separated by the natural crystalline lens. 
 The anterior segment consists of the cornea, the iris and ciliary body and the trabecular meshwork. It is filled with a water-based fluid called aqueous humor and is divided, by the iris, into an anterior chamber and a posterior chamber. The cornea is a clear lens at the front of the eye through which light first passes and is focused toward the back of the eye. The interior surface of the cornea is lined with a single layer of flat, tile-like endothelial cells, whose function is to maintain the transparency of the cornea. The iris is a pigmented muscular curtain located behind the cornea which opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening at the center of the iris. The crystalline lens, located behind the iris, completes the focusing of light and can change shape to focus objects at different distances onto the retina, located in the back of the eye. The trabecular meshwork, a drainage channel located between the iris and the surrounding white portion of the eye, maintains a normal pressure in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining excess aqueous humor. 
 The posterior segment of the eye that is behind the natural lens is filled with a jelly-like material called the vitreous humor. The retina is a layer of nerve tissue in the back of the eye consisting of millions of light receptors called rods and cones, which receive the light image and transmit it to the brain via the optic nerve. 
 Common visual disorders, disease or trauma can affect the eye. One of the most prevalent ocular disorders is cataracts. Cataract formation is generally an age-related disorder that involves the hardening and loss of transparency of the natural crystalline lens, impairing visual acuity. 
 Refractive disorders, which generally are not age-related, include myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. A normal, well-functioning eye receives images of objects at varying distances from the eye and focuses the images on the retina. Refractive errors occur when the eye s natural optical system does not properly focus an image on the retina. Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, occurs when the eye s lens focuses images in front of the retina. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, occurs when the eye s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina. Individuals with myopia or hyperopia may also have astigmatism. Astigmatism is due to an irregular curvature of the cornea or defects in the natural lens that causes light to not focus at a single depth in the eye resulting in blurred vision. Presbyopia is an age-related refractive disorder that limits a person s ability to see in the near and middle-distance range as the natural crystalline lens loses its elasticity, reducing the eye s ability to accommodate or adjust its focus for varying distances. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Nearly all countries where we sell our products have regulations requiring premarket clearance or approval of medical devices by governmental or regulatory authorities. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws also apply to our operations, including, among other things, working conditions, laboratory, clinical, advertising and promotions, and design and manufacturing practices, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. 
 The requirements for clearance or approval to market medical products vary widely by country. The requirements range from minimal requirements to rigorous requirements comparable to those established by the FDA. Obtaining clearance or approval to distribute medical products is complex, costly, and time-consuming in virtually all the major markets where we sell medical devices. We cannot give any assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be cleared or approved in any country where we propose to sell our medical devices or, if approved, whether such approvals will be granted in a timely or cost-effective manner, be as broad in scope as we seek, or be conditioned on post-market study requirements or restrictive labeling. We also cannot give any assurance that if our medical devices are approved for sale in a country, subsequent action will not be taken by the responsible regulatory authorities in the country with respect to our medical devices that might affect our ability to maintain the required approvals in the country or to continue to sell our medical devices in the country. The regulatory requirements in our most important current markets, China, Europe, Japan, Korea and the U.S., are discussed below.

 Regulatory Requirements in the United States. 
 Under the United States Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended (the Act), the FDA has the authority to regulate, among other things, the design, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, product safety, marketing, sales, distribution, premarket clearance and approval, recordkeeping, reporting, advertising, promotion, post-market surveillance, and import and export of medical devices. 
 Most of our products are classified as medical devices intended for human use within the meaning of the Act and, therefore, are subject to FDA regulation. 
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive clearance to market under a notification submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Act, known as the 510(k) premarket notification, or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency or subject to another form of FDA premarket review. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. The FDA establishes procedures for compliance based upon the device s classification as Class I (general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing with FDA, labeling and record-keeping requirements), Class II (performance standards in addition to general controls) or Class III (premarket approval (PMA) required before commercial marketing). Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I (low risk) or II (moderate risk). Manufacturers of Class II devices are generally required to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Most low risk (Class I) devices and some Class II devices are exempt from this requirement. The FDA deems Class III devices to pose the greatest risk and are the most extensively regulated. These devices include life-supporting, life sustaining, or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device. The effect of assigning a device to Class III is to require each manufacturer to submit to the FDA a PMA that includes information on the safety and effectiveness of the device. The FDA reviews device applications and notifications through its Office of Device Evaluation (ODE). 
 510(k) Clearance. Our lens injector systems are Class I devices subject to the 510(k) premarket review and clearance process. A medical device that is substantially equivalent to either a previously-cleared medical device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I may be eligible for the FDA s 510(k) premarket notification process. FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Act does not imply that the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of the medical device has been approved or validated by the FDA. The review period and FDA determination as to substantial equivalence generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed. However, the process may take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make its own initial determination as to whether a change meets this threshold. However, the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. 
 Premarket Approval . Our ICLs are Class III devices subject to the PMA approval process and not 510(k) clearance. The more rigorous PMA process requires us to demonstrate that a new medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA may require that a PMA be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical testing, manufacturing, and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of the device. 
 After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During the review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition to its own review, the FDA may organize an independent advisory panel of experts to review the PMA whenever a device is the first of its kind or the FDA otherwise determines panel review is warranted. The FDA holds panels on a regular basis, but the need to schedule panel review usually adds some weeks or months to the review process. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate design, development, testing, control, validation, 
 8 
 
 documentation, complaint handling, supplier control, and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and conduct of additional post-approval clinical studies or collection of long-term follow-up from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. 
 If a manufacturer plans to make significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, or design of an approved PMA device, the manufacturer must submit an application called a PMA Supplement regarding the change. The FDA generally reviews PMA Supplements on a 180-day agency timetable, which may be extended if significant questions arise in review of the supplement. A manufacturer may implement limited changes prior to the FDA s review of a PMA Supplement. The FDA designates some PMA Supplements as panel-track supplements, which means that the agency believes review by an advisory panel may be warranted. Designation as a panel-track supplement does not necessarily mean that panel review will occur. 
 Clinical or Market Trials. A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials conducted to support premarket clearance or approval generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. Appropriate data must support the IDE application, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the FDA approves the IDE application. All FDA-regulated clinical studies, whether significant or non-significant risk, must be approved and overseen by the appropriate institutional review boards (IRBs) at the clinical trial sites, and informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial must be obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it, if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct in the United States must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product. 
 Oversight of compliance with quality, medical device reporting, clinical study, and other regulations. Both before and after we receive premarket clearance or approval and release a product commercially, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, product complaints and manufacturer s required reports of adverse experiences, product corrections and removals, and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA s QSR and other requirements, such as requirements for advertising and promotion. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations for medical devices embodied in the QSR govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. 
 The FDA s Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO), reviews our activities as a sponsor of clinical research. BIMO conducts facilities inspections as part of a program designed to ensure that data and information contained in requests for IDEs, PMA applications and 510(k) submissions are scientifically valid, reliable, and accurate. Another objective of the program is to ensure that human subjects are protected from undue hazard or risk during scientific investigations. 
 If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risk or substantial harm to public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the devices, detain, or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban the medical devices. The FDA may also issue warning letters or untitled letters, refuse our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, revoke existing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals previously granted, impose operating restrictions, enjoin, and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. In the case of devices subject to pending premarket clearance or approval applications, FDA has broad authority to halt the review of applications and require significant additional data analyses, audits, and other corrective actions where clinical data contained in an application are deemed to be actually or potentially unreliable, inaccurate, or not in compliance with clinical study or good clinical practice requirements.

 For example, on May 27, 2014, we received a warning letter from the FDA (2014 Warning Letter) citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations that were identified by the FDA during an inspection of our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California between February 10, 2014, and March 21, 2014. On November 14, 2014 and continuing through February 4, 2015, the FDA again inspected our Monrovia facility. On February 4, 2015, at the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA issued an FDA-483 with ten inspectional observations (2015 FDA-483). STAAR responded to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483 and implemented its corrective action plans relating to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483. O n June 19, 2018, we received a close-out letter from the FDA lifting the 2014 Warning Letter. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations. 
 Even though we do not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal, state and international healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by the federal government, the states and the international jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation: 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs 

the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals, or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers 

federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters 

the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value relating to certain drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and 

state and international law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state and international laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and state and international laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, which may differ from each other and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

 Regulatory Requirements Outside the United States. 
 CE Marking . In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medical devices must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive is a prerequisite to be able to affix a Conformit Europ enne Mark (CE Mark), without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. 
 The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are a group of private quality-monitoring organizations that are accredited to review medical devices and to monitor quality systems and adverse event reporting. The independent Notified Bodies perform, on a privatized basis, functions similar to the FDA in the U.S. and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. Our facilities in the United States and Switzerland are subject to regular inspection by a designated Notified Body. Other countries, such as Switzerland and the United Kingdom, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices, and a number of countries outside of Europe permit importation of devices bearing the CE Mark. 
 The European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which replaced the existing Directives and provided three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as updating clinical data requirements and introducing new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR face uncertainties and increased costs as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas, including the CE Marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years. In April 2020, the European Parliament postponed implementation of MDR to May 2021 due to the COVID pandemic but did not postpone the May 2024 MDR CE Marking requirement. The exit of the UK from the European Union (BREXIT) has resulted in the requirement to re-certify our preloaded acrylic IOL under a non-UK Notified Body, and to separately register our CE Marked products for sale in the UK. In October 2022, the UK postponed to July 2024 the implementation of the UK Medical Device Regulations related to certification and applying of a UK Certification Mark . The failure of Switzerland and the EU to enter into a Mutual Recognition Agreement resulted in a change of our EC Authorized Representative, discontinuance of the pre-loaded acrylic IOL for the Swiss market, and registration of our remaining products under Swiss law. 
 We have affixed the CE Mark to all our principal products sold in CE Mark jurisdictions including ICLs and delivery systems. In July 2022, our Notified Body in the European Union, DEKRA, certified the CE Marking for our currently certified and commercially available ICLs, delivery systems, and calculation software under the new MDR. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, DEKRA performed audits of our US and Swiss facilities certifying them to the MDR requirements, EN ISO 13485:2016 as well as to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP). MDSAP provides for a single audit recognized by Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United States demonstrating routine compliance with QSR/GMP requirements. 
 Medical Device Regulation in Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) regulates the sale of medical devices under Japan s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act). The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a quasi-governmental organization, performs many of the medical device review functions for MHLW. Medical devices generally must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before the MHLW grants shonin (premarket device approval) or ninsho (premarket certification). Manufacturers and resellers (referred to as Marketing Authorization Holders or MAHs) must also satisfy certain requirements before the MHLW grants a business license, or kyoka . Requirements for manufacturers and MAHs include compliance with Japanese regulations covering GQP (good quality practice) and GVP (good vigilance practice), which largely include conformity to the ISO 13485 standard and are similar to good manufacturing practice and post-market surveillance requirements in the United States, as well as the assignment of internal supervisors over marketing, quality assurance, and safety control. 
 Approval for a new medical device that lacks a substantial equivalent in the Japanese market will generally require the submission of clinical trial data. Only a licensed MAH can apply for premarket device approval in Japan, and in most cases, the clinical trial data must include data gathered from Japanese subjects. For example, STAAR Japan conducted a separate clinical trial in Japan for the shonin application for the ICL. Also, approval for a new medical device will require the manufacturer to undertake to reexamine the safety and efficacy of the device with a 
 11 
 
 review of post-market data gathered within a certain period - normally four years - after approval. The specific post-market reexamination requirement for a medical device is announced at the time of approval. 
 STAAR Japan currently holds shonin approval for the ICL products, preloaded injectors, and their associated lenses, and kyoka licensing as a manufacturer and MAH of medical devices. The sponsor of a clinical trial submitted to the PMDA must strictly follow Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards and must follow the trial with standard Good Post-Market Study Practice (GPSP) reporting and a follow-up program. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of manufacturers and the conformity of products to the requirements of the PMD Act. STAAR is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies. A company s failure to comply with the PMD Act can result in severe penalties, including revocation or suspension of a company s business license and possible criminal sanctions. If the PMDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company. 
 Medical Device Regulation in China and Korea. Sales of our products in China and Korea, as in other countries, are also subject to regulatory requirements. 
 In China, medical devices such as our ICLs are mainly regulated by Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Medical Device (Decree No. 739) promulgated by the State Council. National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is the governmental authority principally responsible for the supervision and administration of medical devices in China. 
 Each medical device intended for commercial distribution in China is subject to a mandatory filing or registration regime regulated by the NMPA. The classification of such devices mainly determines the filing pathways. China has a three-class classification system, from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). Most of STAAR s medical devices are Class II and Class III devices and are subject to a restricted registration pathway. Applicants are required to submit a product technical requirements (PTR) document, which shall mainly include the performance indicators and testing methods of the medical device. Also, applicants must have samples of the device tested in a government-recognized lab or submit in-house or qualified third-party testing results. The PTR, test reports, quality system documents, labeling information, together with other registration documents, are submitted to the Center for Medical Device Evaluation (CMDE) division of the NMPA for technical evaluation. 
 If approved, NMPA issues the medical device a registration license valid for five years. The manufacturer submits a renewal application before the license expiration date to renew a medical device s registration. 
 After approval, in case of substantial changes to the design, raw materials, manufacturing process, and indications, among other things, that may affect the medical device's safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer applies to NMPA for approval of such registration changes. In case of minor changes that do not affect the medical device's safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer submits a change notification to NMPA. 
 While STAAR Surgical AG and STAAR Surgical Company hold the licenses, STAAR China serves as a local agent. The local agent is authorized to submit the registration application materials to NMPA, and provides maintenance support and technical service, oversees the registration and clinical trial process. Under Decree 1, Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting and Reevaluation, the license holder bears the primary responsibility for monitoring medical device adverse events (AEs) and establishing an AE monitoring system. The local agent helps manage AEs in case of device malfunction. 
 The license holder and local agent are responsible for carrying out self-inspection of the quality management system periodically. They are also responsible for identifying, monitoring, and trending adverse events related to the medical device. 
 In Korea, a registration of medical devices such as our ICLs is overseen by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) pursuant to the Medical Device Act. The Medical Device Safety Bureau of the MFDS holds primary responsibility for medical device regulations, while departments within the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety (NIFDS) Evaluation oversee the evaluation and research of medical devices. Medical devices require registration and/or approval prior to commercialization. In Korea, medical device classification closely follows the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) Classification guidelines, with Class I, II, III and IV designation ranked from low to high risk categorization. The registration review route depends on the risk classification of the device. Typically, the MFDS requires similar documentation as required to obtain a CE Mark. Our distributor in Korea is contractually required to obtain, with our assistance, the necessary health registrations, governmental approvals, or clearances to import, market and sell our products. In Korea, we provide our distributor with information and data 
 12 
 
 to obtain appropriate registrations and approvals, and the distributor obtains such registrations. In addition to the device registration, MFDS requires all devices Class II and above to comply with Korean Good Manufacturing Practice (KGMP) quality system standards in order to be marketed in Korea. KGMP standards are based on ISO 13485 quality system standards. However, they are not identical. Therefore, ISO 13485 certificates issued by a notified body in the EU will not be sufficient. To obtain KGMP certification, documents that pertain to all areas of compliance, including design, risk assessment, technical requirements and any other quality system requirements, need to be submitted to an MFDS-authorized third party. Our distributor in Korea submits the application on behalf of STAAR. After the application is submitted, the manufacturing site undergoes either a paper audit or an onsite inspection/audit by an authorized third party and MFDS. Medical device registration licenses do not expire, but the KGPM certificate must be renewed every three years. 
 If the NMPA or MFDS were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions in their respective countries, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company. 
 Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement. 
 Health care providers generally rely on third-party payers, including governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers compensation plans, to cover and reimburse the cost of medical devices and related services. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a medical device if they determine that the product or procedure using the product was not medically appropriate or necessary and are increasingly challenging the price of medical devices and services. 
 Our ICL products generally are not covered by third-party payers, and patients incur out-of-pocket costs for these products and related procedures using our products. Our cataract IOL products used in cataract procedures generally are covered by third-party payers in whole or in part depending upon a variety of factors, including the specific product used and geographic location where the procedure using the covered product is performed. The market for some of our IOL products therefore is influenced by third-party payers policies. 
 Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted cost containment initiatives similar to those in the United States. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that such policies or any future legislation or regulation will not adversely affect the demand for our cataract IOLs or our ability to sell these products at prices we consider adequate. 
 Research and Development 
 We focus on furthering technological advancements in the ophthalmic products industry through the development of innovative premium ophthalmic products (lenses and companion delivery systems), materials and designs. We maintain active internal research and development programs. To achieve our business objectives, we will continue our investment in research and development. 
 During 2023, we intend to continue our focus on research and development in the following areas: 

Development of presbyopia-correcting ophthalmic medical devices, including models that correct cylinder (i.e., astigmatism), including clinical trials of the same 

Development of preloaded injector systems for ophthalmic medical devices and 

Development of a new generation of ophthalmic medical devices and materials. 

 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, and regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we do business. We do not expect compliance with these laws to affect materially our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have no plans to invest in material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of our current fiscal year or for the next fiscal year. We are not aware of any pending actions, litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. However, environmental problems relating to our properties could develop in the future, and such problems could require significant expenditures. In addition, we 
 13 
 
 cannot predict changes in environmental legislation or regulations that may be adopted or enacted in the future and that may adversely affect us. 
 We seek to achieve our corporate goals in an environmentally sustainable manner. Our most recent Sustainability Report, drafted consistent with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework of sustainability topics for medical equipment and supplies companies, is available in the Investor Resources section of our website www.staar.com ). We established a cross-functional climate risk committee to identify the risks presented by climate change and opportunities to reduce our environmental impact. STAAR has several projects underway designed to reduce energy and waste, such as our investment in solar photovoltaic panels at three locations in California (our primary manufacturing facility in Monrovia, our precision manufacturing center of excellence facility/corporate headquarters in Lake Forest, and our Technology Center in Tustin). 
 Human Capital 
 Our goal is to develop, manufacture and sell ophthalmic products throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. To achieve our goal, we continually seek to attract, develop and retain talented people. We strive to make STAAR a diverse, inclusive, safe workplace, with opportunities for employees to grow and develop their careers. We offer competitive compensation and benefits. 
 As of December 30, 2022, we had approximately 964 employees, of which 318 were employed outside the U.S. Of the 964 employees, 882 were regular full-time, 10 were regular part-time and 72 were temporary. In fiscal year 2022, we added approximately 401 employees (including temporary employees) to help keep pace with the growth of our business. Our U.S. overall turnover rate in fiscal year 2022 was approximately 11 (excluding temporary employees), below the overall turnover rate of approximately 18 in the medical device industry. We seek employees who reflect the communities where we conduct operations. In the U.S., currently approximately 47 of our employees are female and approximately 53 are male. The gender ratio for our employees globally is approximately 49 female and 51 male. In the U.S., currently approximately 86 of our employees are from underrepresented populations. Management periodically provides human capital management updates and data to our Board of Directors. Among our Board of Directors, three directors are female, and three directors are male. Two of the directors on our Board of Directors self-identify as members of underrepresented populations. In 2021, we formalized a global ESG Steering Committee consisting of cross-functional employees to address environmental, social, and governance issue at STAAR. In addition, we created a cross-functional Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, and a cross-functional Climate Risk Committee. 
 The health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We created and we follow various safety policies and procedures. Also, we offer health insurance and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and other stakeholders, and which followed guidelines and regulations of the applicable health authorities. For example, the majority of our employees continue to work from home. We implemented additional safety measures for employees who continue critical on-site work such as health screening, implemented social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, and modified workspaces and break areas to reduce the potential for disease transmission. 
 We invest in our employees by offering numerous training opportunities, such as to teach new skills, provide career development opportunities and communicate expectations regarding business conduct and ethics. In addition to salaries, we provide additional compensation and benefits programs (which vary by country) such as cash bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs, among others.

 Glossary 
 The following glossary is intended to help the reader understand some of the terms used in this Report. 
 acrylic a broadly used family of plastics. Acrylic materials used in IOLs have been both water repelling hydrophobic and water-absorbing hydrophilic ). 
 aspheric aspheric lenses are lenses that are designed in a shape that creates a more clearly focused image than traditional spheric lenses. By reducing spherical aberrations, IOLs that feature aspheric optics generally deliver better night vision and contrast sensitivity than spheric IOLs. 
 collagen copolymer - compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. STAAR s Collamer is a collagen copolymer engineered specifically for use in implantable lenses. 
 contrast sensitivity - the ability to visually distinguish an object from its background. 
 crystalline lens the natural lens that is present in the eye at birth, which is a clear structure, located behind the iris that changes shape to focus light onto the retina. 
 excimer laser a specialized ultraviolet laser used in ophthalmology to cut or shape eye tissue. The excimer laser is used during LASIK and PRK surgery. 
 foldable IOL an intraocular lens made of flexible material, which can be inserted with an injector system through a small incision in minimally invasive cataract surgery. 
 hyperopia the refractive disorder commonly known as farsightedness, which occurs when the eye s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. An adult with moderate to high hyperopia cannot see close objects without eyeglasses or contact lenses. Because presbyopia often results in the need for reading glasses, it is sometimes confused with farsightedness. 
 intraocular within the eye. 
 injector or injector system a device in the form of a syringe that is used to deliver a foldable IOL into the eye through a slender nozzle in minimally invasive cataract surgery. 
 iridotomy a small hole created in the iris, usually made with a YAG laser. Prior to implantation of some ICL models a YAG peripheral iridotomy is made in an unobtrusive area at the periphery of the iris to ensure continued fluid flow in the eye after implantation. The ICL with CentraFLOW technology, marketed with the brand names EVO and EVO+, have a central port for fluid flow, which eliminates the need for an iridotomy or iridectomy. 
 LASIK an acronym for laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, a surgical operation that reshapes the cornea to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. LASIK involves first the cutting of a hinged flap to separate the surface layer of the cornea, using a microkeratome (a special blade) or a laser. An excimer laser is then used to ablate tissue and reshape the inner cornea, after which the flap is returned to position. 
 myopia the refractive disorder also known as nearsightedness, which occurs when the eye s lens focuses images in front of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. A person with myopia cannot clearly see distant objects without eyeglasses or contact lenses. 
 ophthalmologist a surgeon who specializes in the diseases and disorders of the eye and the related visual pathway. 
 ophthalmic of or related to the eye. 
 15 
 
 optic the central part of an IOL or ICL, the part that functions as a lens and focuses images on the retina. 
 PRK an acronym for photorefractive keratectomy, the first type of laser surgical operation to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. 
 preloaded injector - an IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector. This differs from the conventional method of packaging IOLs, which requires the surgeon or an assistant to manually load each lens into an injector before surgery. 
 presbyopia an age-related condition in which the crystalline lens loses its ability to focus on both near and far objects. People who have had normal vision will typically begin to need eyeglasses for reading or other close tasks at some point after age 40 due to presbyopia. 
 QSR - the FDA s Quality System Regulation, or current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulation, includes requirements related to the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and servicing of medical devices intended for human use. The regulation sets forth the framework for medical device manufacturers to follow in achieving quality requirements, including requirements related to complaint handling and control of purchased or supplied services, components, and materials bearing on the quality of medical devices. 
 RLE refractive lens exchange, a refractive surgical procedure in which the natural crystalline lens is removed and replaced with an IOL (essentially the same as cataract surgery but performed primarily to address refractive issues not to remove a cataract). 
 refractive market as used in this report refractive market means the overall market volume for refractive surgical procedures of all kinds, including LASIK, PRK, RLE, the ICL product family and other phakic IOLs. As used in this report, the term does not include sales of non-surgical products like eyeglasses and contact lenses. 
 silicone a type of plastic often used in implantable devices that is inert, generally flexible and water-repelling. 
 spheric lenses a spheric lens has surfaces that are shaped like sections of a sphere. 
 toric refers to the shape of a lens designed to correct astigmatism, which has greater refractive power in some sections of the lens than others. 
 YAG an acronym for yttrium-aluminum-garnet, a mineral crystal. Lasers using neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet crystals (Nd:YAG) generate a high-energy beam that can be used in a number of ophthalmic procedures, including creating iridotomies before implantation of some models of the ICL. 

ITEM 1A. 
 
 Risk Factors 

 Investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information contained in this report before making a decision to invest in our common stock. These risks are not the only ones we face. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks that we cannot foresee at this time, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects in a material and adverse manner. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in these forward-looking statements because of factors beyond our control, including the risks faced by us described below. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 We may not be able to continue our growth and profitability trajectory. 
 In 2022 our revenue grew by 23 and we achieved 0.78 diluted earnings per share. While we plan to continue sales growth and remain profitable, there can be no guarantee that we will achieve our growth and profitability plans in 2023. While we achieved profitability in the past five consecutive years, we reported losses in three of the past eight years. Our profitability is challenged by the competitive nature of our industry and the other risks to our business detailed herein. 
 16 
 
 Compliance issues may adversely impact our operations. 
 If we cannot maintain compliance with a particular jurisdiction s regulatory requirements, it could adversely impact our financial performance/have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business and operations. We plan to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements established by applicable global regulatory agencies, however, there can be no guaranty that we will do so. We expect to continue to devote resources and attention to our quality systems and compliance and other regulatory requirements as part of the ordinary course of business. We cannot ensure that our efforts will be successful and failure to achieve or maintain compliance may materially and adversely impact our business and operations. 
 We rely and depend on independent distributors in international markets . 
 Except for Japan, Germany, Spain, the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Singapore, we sell our products through independent distributors who generally control the importation and marketing of our product within their territories. We generally grant exclusive rights to these distributors and rely on them to understand local market conditions, to diligently sell our products and to comply with local laws and regulations. Our agreements with distributors and local laws can make it difficult for us to quickly change from a distributor who we feel is underperforming. If we do terminate an independent distributor, we may lose customers who have been dealing with that distributor and may be required to compensate the distributor for termination. Because these distributors are independent, it may be difficult for us to detect failures in our distributors performance or compliance. Actions by independent distributors could result in declining sales in that territory, harm to the reputation of our company or our products, or legal liability. For example, if Shanghai Lansheng, which accounted for approximately 52 of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, ceased to serve as our distributor, or significantly underperformed our expectations, we may experience a substantial reduction in sales. 
 We rely on sales in China for over 50 of our 2022 net sales. 
 China accounted for approximately 52 of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales. If trade relations with the U.S. were to result in trade restrictions, if COVID-mitigation regulations implemented by the Chinese government, if social or political unrest were to disrupt business in China, or if other events in China significantly reduced or disrupted business activities in China, that may materially and adversely harm our business. 
 Unfavorable economic conditions or negative publicity concerning complications of laser eye surgery, or medical devices in general, could hurt sales of our refractive products. 
 Approximately 95 of our revenue was derived from ICL lenses used in refractive procedures. Refractive surgery is an elective procedure generally not covered by health insurance. Patients must pay for the procedure, frequently through installment financing arrangements with third parties. They can defer the choice to have refractive surgery if they lack the disposable income to pay for it or do not feel their income is secure. Economic stagnation, lack of consumer confidence or a recession in any of our larger markets could slow ICL sales growth or, if severe, cause declines in sales. Because the ICL is our best selling and highest gross margin product, restricted growth or a decline in its sales could materially harm our business. 
 We believe that negative publicity in the past regarding the potential complications of refractive surgery and potential patient dissatisfaction, in particular because of LASIK and other corneal laser-based procedures, decreased patient interest in LASIK as well as all other refractive procedures. Depending on the nature and severity of any future negative publicity about refractive surgery, the growth of ICL sales could be limited or sales could decline due to decreased patient interest in all refractive surgery, including our ICL. 
 Disruptions in our supply chain or failure to adequately forecast product demand could result in significant delays or lost sales. 
 The loss of a material supplier could significantly disrupt our business. In some cases, we obtain components used in certain of our products from single sources. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA s QSR, other applicable laws, or STAAR s requirements, then qualifying and obtaining the required regulatory approvals to use alternative suppliers may be a lengthy and uncertain process during which production could be delayed and we could lose sales. 
 Our sources of supply for raw materials may be threatened by shortages and other market forces, by natural disasters, climate impacts, or public health crises or other disruptive events, or by the supplier s failure to maintain adequate quality or a recall initiated by the supplier. Even when substitute suppliers are available, the need to verify 
 17 
 
 the substitute supplier s regulatory compliance and the quality standards of the replacement material could significantly delay production and materially reduce our sales. 
 In particular, we manufacture the proprietary collagen-containing raw material used in our ICLs. If the supply of these collagen-containing raw materials is disrupted, it could result in our inability to manufacture those products and would have a material adverse effect on STAAR. The loss of our external supply source for silicone material, polymer for injectors, or acrylic lenses, or other components and material could also cause us material harm. 
 Further, any failure by us to forecast demand for or to maintain an adequate supply of, raw material and finished product could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in the sales of that product. For example, in 2022 our ICL sales grew 27 . If our suppliers or we are unable or our suppliers are unwilling to meet our increased manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to produce enough materials or products in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our sales. 
 Because our business is global our sales and profits may fluctuate or decline in response to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or other international risks (including tariffs). 
 Activities outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 95 of our total sales during 2022. Foreign currency fluctuations could result in volatility of our revenue. The results of operations and the financial position of our Japanese subsidiary are reported in Japanese yen and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, exposing us to translation risk. In addition, we are exposed to transaction risk because we incur some of our sales and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our most significant currency exposures are to the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Swiss franc, and the exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar may fluctuate substantially. We do not actively hedge our exposure to currency rate fluctuations. The continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar would likely continue to negatively impact our results. We price some of our products in U.S. dollars, and thus changes in exchange rates can make our products more expensive in some offshore markets and reduce our sales. Inflation could also make our products more expensive and increase the credit risks to which we are exposed. Future foreign currency fluctuations could favorably or unfavorably impact and increase the volatility of our revenue, profitability, and stock price. 
 Economic, social, and political conditions, laws, practices, and local customs vary widely among the countries in which we sell our products. Our operations outside of the U.S. face a number of risks and potential costs, including, enjoying less stringent protection of intellectual property, and facing economic, political, and social uncertainty in some countries, especially in emerging markets. For example, sales in certain Asian and developing markets may result in lower margins and higher exposure to intellectual property infringement or counterfeits. Also, if China, which accounted for approximately 52 of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, experienced a significant economic downturn or disruption, continued restrictive COVID mitigation efforts, social or political unrest, we may experience a significant reduction in sales. Further, trade disputes between the United States and its significant trading partners may adversely affect our sales, including as a result of the imposition of tariffs or other barriers or restrictions on trade, or increase our costs. The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically could negatively impact the overall economic condition in our markets, including China, which could have a negative effect on our sales. In addition, new laws or regulations in China or elsewhere applicable to foreign medical device companies could negatively impact our business. Also, we are exposed to credit and collectability risk on our trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance we can effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses and our ability to transfer foreign earnings to the U.S. may be subject to taxes or restricted or result in incurring substantial costs. Our continued success as a global company depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries where we do business. These and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business, financial condition and results of operations as a whole. 
 Changes in our effective tax rate or additional tax liabilities could adversely impact our net income. 
 We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes in Switzerland, the U.S. and various other jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws and regulations in these jurisdictions are inherently complex and we will be obliged to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to us, including our subsidiaries and our operations and businesses. Those laws and regulations include those related to any restructuring of intercompany operations, holdings or financings, the valuation of intercompany services cross-border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax, VAT and transfer tax. Further, our tax liabilities could be adversely affected by numerous other factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher 
 18 
 
 statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any changes in our judgments and interpretation of tax laws or any material differences as a result of any audits could result in unfavorable tax adjustments that may have an adverse effect on our overall tax liability. 
 Changes in tax laws could result in additional tax liabilities. 
 Changes in tax laws can and do occur. For example, in 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is complex and continues to be further clarified with supplemental guidance. Changes to tax laws may require us to make significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes. Thus, as a result, such changes could result in substantially higher taxes and a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial conditions and liquidity. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended fundamental tax reforms affecting the taxation of multinational corporations, including the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which in part aims to address international corporate tax strategies. Countries have already enacted significant measures in this regard. Further work is currently being undertaken by the OECD on its proposal to reform international allocation of taxing rights by allocating a greater share of taxing rights to countries where consumers are located, regardless of the physical presence of a business (Pillar One), and to implement a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). The detail of the proposals is subject to change and the impact to us will need to be determined by reference to the final rules. 
 We are vulnerable to any loss of use of our principal manufacturing facility. 
 We manufacture all of our ICL products at a single facility in Monrovia, California. All or a portion of the Monrovia facility could suffer catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, including manufacturing challenges such as equipment failure. Developing additional manufacturing sites may require significant expense for personnel and equipment and a long period to obtain regulatory approvals. Our California and Japanese facilities are in areas where earthquakes could cause catastrophic loss. 
 In our major markets, regulatory approval to manufacture materials and sell our products is generally limited to the current manufacturing site, and changing the site requires applications to and approval from regulatory bodies prior to commercialization. To satisfy our own quality standards as well as regulations, we must follow strict protocols to confirm that products and materials made at a new site are equivalent to those made at the currently approved site. For example, we have commenced activities to resume manufacturing ICLs at our Swiss facility, and to commence manufacturing EVO Viva at our Lake Forest facility, but there can be no guaranty whether or when these facilities will be prepared and approved by regulators for manufacturing. Even minor changes in equipment, supplies or processes require validation. Unanticipated delays with a transferred process or difficulties in manufacturing a transferred material could interrupt our supply of products. Any sustained interruption in supply could cause us to lose market share and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 If any or a portion of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, or if one of our facilities is found not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, delay or reduce sales and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility, as well as lost customers or sales. Our insurance for property damage and business interruption may not cover any particular loss, or, if covered, be sufficient. We do not carry insurance or reserve funds for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. 
 Public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may impact our business. 
 In 2022, we generated approximately 95 of our total sales outside the U.S. A natural disaster (such as a climate-related event or otherwise), public health crisis (such as a pandemic or epidemic), political crisis (such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict), or other events outside of our control that may occur anywhere around the world, may adversely impact our business and operating results. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact surgeon or patient spending in the impacted region(s) or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results. 
 For example, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, resulting in governmental authorities and other third parties implementing or recommending a number of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and business limitations and shutdowns. The impact of COVID-19 and these measures implemented or 
 19 
 
 recommended by governmental authorities and other third parties have had a significant impact on many businesses, including ours. For example, we suspended most of our production on March 17 , 2020 with the exception of continuation of critical late-staged processes. Moreover, our revenues have been adversely impacted, since the first quarter of 2020 in global geographies characterized as hot spots for the COVID-19 virus and its variants as customers in those locations were not able to carry out procedures or were limited in their activities by government regulations intended to contain the spread of COVID-19 and variant strains . In certain of these markets, sales paused as elective surgeries were discouraged to support COVID-19 related needs. We expect this decrease in sales in certain geographies , such as parts of Europe and Asia , to continue through the first half of 202 3 and possibly beyond as different geographies may or may not resume pre-pandemic levels of business activities as novel COVID-19 variant strains emerge . We cannot predict when different governments and circumstances will permit businesses in their jurisdictions to return to pre-pandemic levels of business or when consumers will resume scheduling procedures. We also cannot predict COVID-19 s impact on the overall economy of various markets, including the existence or extent of a possible recession. Thus, at this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact delayed medical procedures and delayed lens orders, and the related impact on our results is uncertain however, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We monitor such events and take actions that we deem reasonable given the circumstances. In the future other types of crises, may create an environment of business uncertainty around the world, which may hinder sales and/or supplies of our products nationally and internationally. 
 The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the duration and scope of the pandemic the impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on consumer spending how quickly and to what extent more customary economic and operating conditions can resume its impact on our customers facilities levels of consumer confidence whether our COVID-19 preventative measures such as remote working arrangements, changes to manufacturing work areas, such as adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other workforce changes will impact operational efficiency or inventory levels our ability to obtain supplies from vendors or transport products to customers or adverse impacts to any other element of our supply chain the impact on regulatory agencies, including the review and approval process the impact on clinical studies the ability of our customers to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic such as resuming activities and growing patient interest in our lenses and actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic. 
 In addition, the pandemic could adversely impact our ability to recruit and/or retain employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex production operations, as well as members of our management team, third-party suppliers, distributors and vendors. To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties (for example, for health and safety reasons), we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, and other important commercial and operational functions. 
 Finally, if COVID-19, or a variant strain, continues to spread and escalate domestically or internationally, or if governments impose additional measures intended to mitigate the spread and related effects of the pandemic, the risks described above could be elevated significantly. Should that occur, and the COVID-19 pandemic persist for a prolonged time, the above factors and others that are currently unknown could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects and could elevate known risks described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 We depend on key employees. 
 We depend on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of a key employee could hurt our business. It could be particularly detrimental if any key employee or employees went to work for a competitor. Also, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, train, motivate and retain other highly skilled personnel. Failure to do so may adversely affect our results. We do not maintain insurance policies to cover the cost of replacing the services of any of our key employees who may unexpectedly die or become disabled. 
 We compete with much larger companies and low-cost Asian manufacturers. 
 Our primary competitors, including Alcon (formally Novartis), Johnson & Johnson (formerly Abbott Medical Optics, or AMO), Bausch Health Companies (formerly Valeant or Bausch & Lomb), and Carl Zeiss Meditec have much greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we do and 
 20 
 
 some of them have large international markets for a full suite of ophthalmic products. Their greater resources for research, development and marketing, and their greater capacity to offer comprehensive products and equipment to providers, makes for intense competition. In addition, competitors from Asia are beginning to appear in some markets with their low-cost version of an implantable contact lens, which competes with our ICL. With our increased commercial success with the ICL, additional companies may seek to enter the refractive phakic intraocular lens market. 
 Non-compliance with anti-corruption laws could lead to penalties or harm our reputation . 
 We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Any failure to comply with these laws, even if inadvertent, could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on foreign subsidiaries and independent distributors requires vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt or non-compliant activity, including, for example, with respect to our 2022 internal review of compliance with certain regulations in the Japanese market related to sales of pre-loaded aphakic intraocular lenses for use in cataract surgery (IOLs, not ICLs). In many of our markets outside the U.S., doctors and hospital administrators may be deemed government officials. Despite precautions we may take, non-compliance may occur that could harm our reputation and financial results. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their employees or agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with such individuals. 
 We could experience losses due to product liability claims. 
 We have been subject to product liability claims in the past and may experience such claims in the future. Product liability claims against us may not be covered, may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record a loss in excess of our deductible. A product liability claim that exceeds our insurance coverage could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if an insurance policy covers a product liability loss, we must generally pay for losses until they reach the level of the policy s stated deductible or retention amount after which the insurer begins paying. The payment of retentions or deductibles for a significant number of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Any product liability claim would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers. We cannot assure investors that we will not have product liability claims in the future or that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and we may be subject to significant increases in pension benefit obligations under those pension plans. 
 We sponsor two defined benefit pension plans through our wholly owned Swiss and Japanese subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Swiss Plan and the Japan Plan , respectively. Both plans are underfunded and may require significant cash payments. 
 We determine our pension benefit obligations and funding status using many assumptions. If the investment performance does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, or not realized, we may be required to contribute more than we currently expect and increase our future pension benefit obligations to be funded from our operations. 
 Our pension plans taken together are underfunded by approximately 1.9 million 1.2 million for the Japan Plan and 0.7 million for the Swiss Plan) as of December 30, 2022. 
 If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our worldwide pension obligations, as well as other cash requirements, we may be materially and adversely harmed and have to seek additional capital. 
 Our activities involve hazardous materials, emissions, and use of an irradiator and may subject us to environmental liability. 
 Our manufacturing, research and development activities involve the use of hazardous materials and equipment and use of an irradiator. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacturing, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products in the places where we have operations. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials and equipment. Remedial environmental actions could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we were involved in an environmental accident or found to 
 21 
 
 be in substantial non-compliance with applicable environmental laws, it could harm our reputation, and we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines. 
 Data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches and/or noncompliance with data protection and privacy regulations could negatively impact our operations. 
 We depend on information technology networks and our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries, customers, and suppliers. The integrity and protection of our customer, vendor, supplier, employee, and other Company data that we collect, use and store, including personal information, is an important part of our business. Addressing applicable and evolving security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our business operations. 
 Certain of our employees, contractors and vendors have access to and use personal information in the ordinary course of our business. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and business controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee, contractor or vendor error, or malfeasance, systems error (whether as a result of an intentional breach, a natural disaster or human error) or other disruptions or subject to the inadvertent or intentional unauthorized release of information. Any such occurrence could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the supply of products we provide to our clients, compromise our intellectual property or other confidential business information, or damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our profitability, revenue and competitive position. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enabled many of our employees to work remotely, which may make us more vulnerable to cyberattacks. While we have not experienced a material system failure, accident or security breach to date, we cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. We continue to invest in our cybersecurity program to enhance current capabilities and also implement new capabilities in our effort to keep pace with the changing threat landscape. Also, certain of our information technology systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such events could materially harm our reputation and financial results. Moreover, while we maintain cyber insurance, it may be insufficient to address any potential loss incurred. We also rely on third parties to host or otherwise process some of this data (such as cloud-based computing). Elements of our information technology systems that we outsource to third parties may also be vulnerable to various types of attacks or disruptions. Any failure by a third party to prevent security breaches could have adverse consequences for us. 
 We are subject to various data protection and privacy regulations in different jurisdictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We have made and continue to engage in compliance efforts to satisfy these and other regulations, however, we may be unsuccessful in complying with applicable requirements, and may be at risk of enforcement actions and/or subject to fines, including those imposed by a data protection authority. As a result, we may incur substantial expense in complying with data protection and privacy regulations, exposure resulting from a data breach, ransomware or non-compliance and may be distracted from other aspects of our business. 
 The increased use of social media platforms and mobile technologies presents additional risks and challenges. 
 New technologies are increasingly used to communicate about our products and the health conditions they are intended to treat. The use of these media poses risks to our business and requires specific attention and monitoring. For example, patients, competitors, or others may use these channels to comment on the safety or effectiveness of a product and to report an alleged adverse event. Negative posts or comments about us or our business on any social networking web site could harm our reputation. In addition, our employees may use social media tools and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability, or which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. In either case, such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

 Acquisitions of technologies, products, and businesses could disrupt our operations, involve increased expenses and present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions. 
 We may consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of technologies, products, and businesses that we believe are complementary to our business. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, and products acquired, and mitigating the risk of unknown liabilities some of which may result in significant payments or charges to earnings. 
 If we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect our business, and our ability to develop and introduce new products. Actual costs and sales synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than we expect and may take longer to achieve than we anticipate. Acquisitions may also divert management s attention from our core business. Furthermore, the products of companies we acquire may overlap with our products or those of our customers, creating conflicts with existing relationships or with other commitments that are detrimental to the integrated businesses. 
 If we are not able to manage growth successfully, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 If we continue to experience rapid growth, this places a significant strain on financial, operational, and managerial resources. We must continue to implement and enhance our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our operations, and continue to recruit and train qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that our strategic and operational planning will allow us to adequately manage anticipated growth. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal practices and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. For example, in the second half of 2021, as we increased production to meet increased demand, we experienced a decline in product yield. In the event of a slower-than-planned manufacturing output, we may be unable to quickly meet customer demand. In the event of a significant manufacturing challenge, we may experience delays in meeting product demand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, the expense associated with increased manufacturing and sales/marketing to meet increased demand may exceed our expectations. We manufacture in the U.S. and inflation has increased in the U.S. during recent months, and we can expect as a result to experience increased costs in our own supply chain which may be difficult to pass along to our customers. Any inability to successfully manage growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. 
 Corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, may impose additional costs, expose us to reputational and emerging areas of risks, and could negatively affect our business. 
 Investors, stockholders, customers, suppliers and other third parties are increasingly focusing on ESG and corporate responsibility practices and reporting. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with the evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, as well as the evolving international regulations relating to ESG matters, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately, may suffer from reputational damage and result in the business, financial condition and/or stock price of a company being materially and adversely affected. Further, this increased focus on ESG issues may result in significant increase in additional expenses (e.g., direct or indirect cost of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs) to comply with evolving regulations and/or third-party requirements that could adversely impact our business or profitability. 
 In response to stakeholder expectations, we have commenced reporting of our sustainability endeavors and future plans. These disclosures reflect our current aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these plans present numerous risks, any of which could have a material negative impact on us. Our ability to achieve any goal, including with respect to ESG-related initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Certain shareholders may reduce or eliminate their holdings of our stock based on ESG issues. For example, an allegation or perception that we have not taken sufficient action in these areas could negatively harm our reputation and/or result in certain investors reducing or eliminating their holdings of our stock. 
 Our method of tracking our ESG efforts may change as expectations and standards evolve, which may result in revisions to our goals or reported progress. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be 
 23 
 
 negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill certain targets or goals, or to satisfy various reporting standards could also have negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. 
 Finally, we expect to incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with our various ESG practices. If we fail to adopt ESG standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire, report on our ESG efforts or practices accurately, or satisfy the expectations of stakeholders, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth may be adversely impacted. 
 Climate changes could negatively affect our business. 
 Climate changes, such as extreme weather conditions, could create financial risk to our business. Global physical climate changes, including unseasonable weather conditions and earthquakes, could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of water, energy, or materials within our supply chain, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. This could in turn put pressure on our manufacturing costs and result in reduced profit margins associated with certain of our products. Climate-related transitional risks, such as changing regulations, could also increase our costs and adversely impact our operations or financial performance. 
 Risks Related to the Ophthalmic Products Industry 
 Unless we keep pace with advances in our industry and persuade physicians to adopt our new products, our sales will not grow and may decline. 
 Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to timely develop products to treat diseases and disorders of the eye that are more effective, safer, or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products, and are accepted by physicians and patients. Sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if one of our competitors introduces a superior product, or if we announce a new product of our own. If we focus on research and development or technologies that do not lead to better products, more effective or advanced products could surpass our current and planned products. In addition, such product development efforts could require a significant investment of resources. If we are able to develop new products, we must manufacture these products economically and market them successfully by demonstrating to enough eye-care professionals the overall benefits of using them. If we do not timely develop new products that meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for our new products, our sales and results of operations could be harmed. For example, it is uncertain whether physicians in countries that recognize the CE Mark will adopt the EVO Viva lens for use in presbyopic eyes, which our Notified Body approved for marketing and sale in July 2020. 
 Resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve regulatory approval or commercial success. 
 Development of new implantable technology, from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch, is expensive and time-consuming. Because of the complexities and uncertainties of ophthalmic research and development, products we are developing, including those currently in development, may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to successfully market the products. Our new products, including those currently under development, may fail to become commercially successful. 
 We may be required to conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of new or enhanced products, such clinical trials are expensive, complex, can take years to complete, and have highly uncertain outcomes. 
 In order to further advance the development of, and ultimately receive regulatory approval to manufacture and sell, our new products or product enhancements, we may be required to conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Clinical trials are expensive, complex, can take many years to complete, and have highly uncertain outcomes. Delays, setbacks, or failures can occur at any time, or in any phase of the clinical trials, and can result from concerns about safety, a lack of demonstrated efficacy, or poor study or trial design. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or prevented by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

an inability to reach agreement with regulatory authorities regarding the scope or extent of a proposed clinical trial 

an inability to timely identify and reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites and entities involved in the conduct of our clinical trials 

 24 

failure by third-party clinical trial managers to comply with applicable regulations or protocols 

flaws in the design of the clinical trials 

slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment 

periodic amendments to clinical trial protocols to address certain variables which arise during the course of a trial 

lack of effectiveness of our products or 

unforeseen safety issues. 

 We are subject to extensive government regulation worldwide, which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products. 
 We are regulated by regional, national, state and local agencies in the U.S. as well as governmental authorities in those international countries in which we manufacture or distribute products, such as in Europe and Asia. These regulations may govern the research, development, manufacturing, and commercial activities relating to medical devices, including their design, pre-clinical and clinical testing, clearance or approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion. Failure to receive necessary approvals in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, could harm our business and operating results. In addition, regulations and requirements for approvals can vary in each international country, which can significantly increase the costs to sell our products in these international countries. 
 Complying with government regulation substantially increases the cost of developing, manufacturing and selling our products. 
 Competing in the ophthalmic products industry requires us to introduce new or improved products and processes continuously, and to submit these to the FDA and other regulatory bodies for clearance or approval. Obtaining clearance or approval can be a long and expensive process, and clearance or approval is never certain. For example, the FDA or another country s regulatory agency, could require us to conduct an additional clinical trial prior to granting clearance or approval of a product and such clinical trial could take a long time and have substantial expense. Furthermore, there is no assurance that clearance or approval will be granted. 
 If a regulatory authority delays or does not grant approval of a potentially significant product, the potential sales of the product and its value to us can be substantially reduced. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency clears or approves a product, the clearance or approval may limit the indicated patient populations or uses of the product, or may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product, or may require expensive post-marketing studies or surveillance. If we cannot obtain timely regulatory clearance or approval of our new products, or if the clearance or approval is too narrow, we will not be able to successfully market these products, which would eliminate or reduce our potential sales and earnings. 
 In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may change their clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development, cause the loss of previously received approvals or clearances or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Also, we expect to incur additional costs complying with the European Union s new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). 
 We depend on proprietary technology but our intellectual property protections may be limited. 
 While we rely on various intellectual property laws, contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures and copyright laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology, we rely more on trade secrets and know-how, which may not prevent third parties from using publicly available information to access our technology. With respect to our patents, any of them may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Any of our pending patent applications may fail to result in an issued patent or fail to provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technology. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and to protect or determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. We also challenge others patents or patent applications from time to time. Any litigation could result in substantial expense, may reduce our profits, and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered by patents in our industry may involve complex legal issues that are open to dispute. Any litigation or claims against or instituted by us, whether or not successful, could result in 
 25 
 
 substantial costs, divert resources and the efforts of our personnel away from daily operations, harm our reputation, result in the impairment of our intellectual property rights, limit our ability to pursue future products and/or otherwise materially adversely impact our business. 
 We may not successfully replace our existing products, including those that lose or have lost patent protection. 
 As our existing patents expire, many of which already expired over the past several years, our competitors may introduce products using the same technology. Because of this possible increase in competition, we may lose sales and/or may need to reduce our prices to maintain sales of our products, which would make them less profitable. If we fail to develop and successfully launch new products and/or obtain new patents, our sales and profits with respect to our products could decline significantly. We may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products. 
 While we will continue developing intellectual property protections for our future products, third parties may pursue blocking patents that limit our ability to manufacture such products. 
 We plan to continue relying on our intellectual property rights to protect products and technology that we may develop or employ in the future, but third parties may develop and obtain patents covering such products or technology. In such event, we may need to obtain licenses for such patents. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could limit our ability to manufacture our future products and operate our business. 
 L aws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our relationships with physicians, and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under various U.S. and international bribery, fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy, and similar laws, collectively referred to as healthcare compliance laws. Healthcare compliance laws are broad, sometimes ambiguous, complex, and subject to change and changing interpretations, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Possible sanctions for violation of these healthcare compliance laws include fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and despite our compliance efforts, we face the risk of an enforcement activity or a finding of a violation of these laws. For example, in 2022 a Japanese trade association (Japan Fair Trade Council of the Medical Devices Industry) ruled that our subsidiary in Japan improperly implemented a program with surgeons and hospitals to obtain videos of cataract surgeries where our cataract intraocular lenses were used. 
 We have entered into a variety of agreements with healthcare professionals. We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as well as a Compliance Program for Interactions with Healthcare Professionals which govern our relationships with healthcare professionals to bolster our compliance with healthcare compliance laws. While our relationships with healthcare professionals are structured to comply with applicable laws and we provide training on these laws and our Code and Program, it is possible that enforcement authorities may view our relationships as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties or debarment. In any event, any enforcement review of or action against us as a result of such review, regardless of outcome, could be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in or interpretations of these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and disgorgement, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 If we recall a product, the cost and damage to our reputation could harm our business. 
 We have voluntarily recalled our products in the past and recalls could take place again. We may also be subject to recalls initiated by manufacturers of products we distribute. We cannot eliminate the risk of a material recall in the future. Recalls can result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured, especially if the replacements must be redesigned or approved by regulatory authorities prior to distribution. If recalled products have already been implanted, we may bear some or all of the cost of corrective surgery. Recalls may also damage our professional reputation and the reputation of our products. The inconvenience caused by recalls and related interruptions in supply, the underlying causal issues, and the damage to our reputation, could cause professionals to discontinue using our products. 
 Companies are required to maintain certain records of actions, even if they determine such actions are not reportable to the FDA or other regulatory bodies. If we determine that certain actions do not require notification of 
 26 
 
 the FDA or others, the FDA or other regulatory bodies may disagree with our determinations and require us to report those actions as recalls. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory bodies could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted or failing to timely report or initiate a reportable product action. Moreover, depending on the corrective action we take to redress a product s deficiencies or defects, the FDA or other regulatory bodies may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. 
 Changes in FDA or international regulations related to product approval, including those that apply retroactively, could make us less competitive and harm our business. 
 FDA and foreign regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and we cannot assure investors that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, with possible retroactive effect, will not adversely affect us. Additionally, any changes, whether in interpretation or substance, in existing regulations or policies, or any future adoption of new regulations or policies by relevant regulatory bodies, could rescind, prevent or delay approval of our products, which could materially impact our competitive position, business, and financial results. Further, we or our distributors have obtained regulatory approvals outside the United States for many of our products. We or our distributors may be unable to maintain regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals in these countries or obtain qualifications, clearances, or approvals in other countries. If we are not successful in doing so, our business and financial condition will be harmed. 
 If our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions, agency enforcement actions and harm to our results. 
 Under the FDA regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices in international markets, such as European Union and Asian markets, are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In the future, we may experience events that would require reporting to the FDA pursuant to the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations or to other regulatory bodies pursuant to international regulations. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as product actions or customer notifications, or agency actions, such as inspection, mandatory recall, or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. 
 The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by us as the manufacturer. We have made decisions that certain types of events are not reportable under the MDR and similar regulations however, there can be no assurance that the FDA or other regulatory bodies will agree with our decisions. If we fail to report MDRs to the FDA or other regulatory bodies within the required timeframes, or at all, or if the FDA or others disagree with any of our determinations regarding the reportability of certain events, the FDA or other regulatory bodies could take enforcement actions against us, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results. 
 If we modify our products, we may have to obtain new marketing clearances or approvals or may have to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained. 
 Any modification to a 510(k) cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including any significant change in design or manufacture, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared and PMA approved products and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals are not required. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMAs for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing and/or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 27 
 
 Regulatory agencies in other countries similarly require approval or clearance prior to our marketing or selling products in those countries. We rely on our distributors to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals of our products in certain countries outside of the United States. If we or our distributors are unable to obtain additional clearances or approvals needed to market existing or new products in the United States or elsewhere or obtain these clearances or approvals in a timely fashion or at all, or if our existing clearances or approvals are revoked or restricted, our revenues and profitability may decline. 
 Investigations and allegations, whether or not they lead to enforcement action or litigation, can materially harm our business and our reputation. 
 Our failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulators can result in civil and criminal fines, the recall of products, the total or partial suspension of manufacturing or distribution, seizure of products, injunctions, lawsuits, failure to obtain approval of pending product applications, withdrawal of existing product approvals, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and other sanctions. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action can also generate adverse publicity and require us to divert substantial resources from more productive uses in our business. Enforcement actions could affect our ability to distribute our products commercially and could materially harm our business. 
 In addition, negative publicity about investigations or allegations of misconduct, even without a finding of misconduct, could harm our reputation with healthcare professionals and also with the market for our common stock. Responding to investigations or conducting internal investigations can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our business. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. 
 The market price for our common stock has fluctuated widely. The closing price of our common stock ranged from 46.82 to 111.58 per share during the year ended December 30, 2022. Our stock price could continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to factors such as market perceptions, quarterly variations in operating results, operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, changes in financial estimates, changes in the business and market valuations of competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature, additions or departures of key personnel, future sales of our common stock and stock volume fluctuations. Also, general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate fluctuations, and public health crises, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Because we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. 
 We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. We currently expect to retain any earnings for use to further develop our business, and do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any such dividends in the future depends upon our earnings, financial condition, capital needs, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, and may be restricted by future agreements with lenders. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchase their shares. 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, and contractual provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or sale of our company. Our Certificate of Incorporation empowers our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, and to determine the rights of each such series as provided in our Certificate of Incorporation. These provisions give our Board of Directors the ability to deter, discourage or make more difficult a change in control of our company, even if such a change in control could be deemed in the interest of our stockholders or if such a change in control would provide our stockholders with a substantial premium for their shares over the then-prevailing market price for our common stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including the following: 

stockholders cannot act by consent 

stockholders cannot fill vacancies on our Board of Directors 

certain provisions, including those related to changing the number of directors, limiting our stockholders ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors, prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, and 

 28 

amending such provisions, cannot be altered, amended or repealed, and provisions inconsistent therewith cannot be adopted, without the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon and 

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose other business. 

 In addition, we are generally subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging tender offers for our common stock or prevent changes in our management. 
 Ownership of our common stock is concentrated among a few investors, which may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Substantial sales by such investors could cause our common stock price to decline. 
 Our largest investor beneficially owns approximately 18 of our outstanding common stock, and our largest four investors beneficially own approximately 50 of our outstanding common stock. One of our current six directors was recommended by our investors. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by any or all of our largest investors or our other stockholders within a short period of time could cause our common stock price to decline, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or acquire other businesses using our common stock as consideration. 
 In addition, having such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding common stock or control of our Board of Directors, including through a proxy solicitation. 
 Future sales of our common stock could reduce our stock price. 
 We could issue additional shares of common or preferred stock to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes without stockholder approval. In addition, we could designate and sell a class of preferred stock with preferential rights over our common stock with respect to dividends or other distributions. Also, we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement is available to cover the future public offering and sale of up to approximately 200,000,000 in equity or debt securities or any combination of such securities. Sales of our common or preferred stock under the shelf registration or in other transactions could dilute the interest of existing stockholders and reduce the market price of our common stock. Even in the absence of such sales, the perception among investors that additional sales of equity securities may take place could reduce the market price of our common stock.

 Overview 
 STAAR Surgical Company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells implantable lenses for the eye and companion delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. We are the world s leading manufacturer of intraocular lenses for patients seeking lens-based refractive vision correction, and we also make lenses for use in surgery to treat cataracts. All the lenses we make are foldable, which allows the surgeon to insert them into the eye through a small incision during minimally invasive surgery. Refractive surgery is performed to treat the type of visual disorders that have traditionally been corrected using eyeglasses or contact lenses. We refer to our lenses used in refractive surgery as implantable Collamer lenses or ICLs. The field of refractive surgery includes both lens-based procedures, using products like our ICL family of products, and laser-based procedures like LASIK. Successful refractive surgery can correct common vision disorders such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Cataract surgery is a common outpatient procedure where the eye s natural lens that has become cloudy with age is removed and replaced with an artificial lens called an intraocular lens (IOL) to restore the patient s vision. STAAR employs a commercialization strategy that strives for increased share of the refractive market and sustainable profitable growth. Our goal is to position our refractive lenses throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. We position our IOL lenses used in surgery that treats cataracts based on quality and value.

Strategic Imperatives for 2023 
 For 2023 we will focus on the following strategic imperatives: 

Position EVO Implantable Lenses as the Most Desirable Pathway to Visual Freedom 

Innovate and Develop a Pipeline of Next Generation Premium Collamer-Based Intraocular Lenses 

Accelerate the Transition in Refractive Surgery to Lens-Based through Clinical Validation and Medical Affairs Excellence 

Achieve our corporate imperatives in alignment with our Environmental, Social and Governance commitments 

Continue our Focus on and Commitment to STAAR s Culture of Quality and 

Delight Shareholders. 

 Finally, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new product lines, technologies, and companies. 
 We continue to monitor the commercial and operational impact of new variants of COVID-19 in our markets, which remains uncertain at this time and may adversely affect our financial results. For example, COVID-19 impacted certain of our Chinese customers and, in the U.S., STAAR s manufacturing operations.

 Net sales for 2021 increased 41 from 2020 . The increase in net sales was due to increase d ICL sales of 71.5 million , partially offset by a decrease in other product sales of 4.5 million. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by 0 . 5 million. 
 Total ICL sales for 2022 increased 27 from 2021, with unit growth up 33 . The sales increase was driven by the APAC region, which grew 32 with unit growth of 36 , primarily due to sales growth in other APAC Distributors up 43 , China up 38 , India up 37 , Korea up 18 and Japan up 14 . The Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America region sales decreased 1.0 with unit increase of 15 , due to sales decreases in our direct markets down 8 , offset by sales growth in our distributor markets up 9 . The North America region sales increased 51 , with unit increase of 47 , due to sales growth in the U.S. up 59 and Canada up 10 . Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted ICL sales by 10.3 million, which impacted our Japan and Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. ICL sales represented 94.8 of our total sales for fiscal year 2022. 
 Total ICL sales for 2021 increased 51 from 2020, with unit growth up 48 . The sales increase was driven by the APAC region, which grew 51 with unit growth of 47 , primarily due to sales growth in India up 123 , Japan up 56 , China up 50 , other APAC Distributors up 50 and Korea up 36 .

Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted ICL sales by 0.8 million. ICL sales represented 92.4 of our total sales for fiscal year 2021. 
 Other product sales, includes cataract IOLs, delivery systems and normal recurring sales adjustments such as sales return allowances. As a result of third-party materials and supply chain challenges that affect our cataract IOLs and associated delivery devices, we will no longer manufacture cataract IOLs, though we will continue to support these products through the end of 2023, as supplies permit. We do not expect this decision to have a significant impact to revenue growth in future years. Other product sales for 2022 decreased 16 from 2021, mainly due to decreased sales of cataract IOLs. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted other product sales by 2.6 million. Other product sales represented 5.2 of our total sales for fiscal year 2022. 
 Other product sales in 2021 decreased 20 from 2020, mainly due to product yield issues requiring rework related to preloaded injector parts manufactured on our behalf by a third-party manufacturer then sold by us to a third-party manufacturer for product they sell to their customers, as well as decreased cataract IOL sales. Changes in foreign currency unfavorably impacted other product sales by 0.3 million. Other product sales represented 7.6 of our total sales for fiscal year 2021.

 Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to the income taxes generated in foreign jurisdictions. Also impacting our effective tax rates was a release of 0.8 million of our U.S. valuation allowance in 2022, a recapture of our U.S. valuation allowance of 0.8 million in 2021 and a release of 0.5 million of our U.S. valuation allowance in 2020. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no unrecognized benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken by us.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in deposits and money market accounts held at banks and financial institutions. Our investment policy primary objective is capital preservation while maximizing our return on investment. Investments available for sale may include U.S. government and corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certain certificates deposit and related security types, that are rated by two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations with minimum investment grade ratings of AAA to A-/A-1+ to A-2, or the equivalent. The maturity of individual investments may not extend 24 months from the date of purchase. There are also limits to the amount of credit exposure in any given security type. Additionally, during 2021 we fully repaid and cancelled our Japan line of credit and cancelled our Swiss framework agreement given our current cash resources. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Our current liquidity and capital resources, as discussed above, will enable us to meet our known contractual obligations as of December 30, 2022 (in thousands):

For 2022, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of 38.8 million in net income and 25.8 million in non-cash items, offset by 28.9 million in working-capital changes. For 2021, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of 24.5 million in net income and 21.9 million in non-cash items, offset by 2.4 million in working-capital changes. For 2020, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of 17.8 million in non-cash items and 5.9 million in net income, offset by 2.7 million in working-capital changes 
 For 2022 we decided to invest our cash in slightly higher yielding securities. For 2022, net cash used in investment activities of 156.4 million resulted from 155.7 million in purchases of investments available for sale and 18.1 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by 17.5 million of proceeds from the maturity of investments available for sale. The increase in investment in property, plant and equipment during 2022, relative to 2021, and the increase during 2021, relative to 2020, was primarily due to an increased in investments in manufacturing facilities. 
 For 2022, net cash provided by financing activities of 8.3 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. For 2021, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 19.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by 1.3 million repayment on the Japan line of credit and 0.3 million repayment of finance lease obligations. For 2020, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 20.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by 0.6 million repayment of finance lease obligations and a 0.5 million repayment on the Japan line of credit. 
 Accounts receivable, net was 62.4 million and 43.5 million at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 89 and 67 days, respectively for 2022 and 2021. The increase in DSO in 2022 is temporary and was due to decreased customer collections of receivables in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily from payment delays from customers where there was a surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting from lifting COVID-19 restrictions. 
 Inventories, net was 24.2 million and 17.2 million at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Days Inventory on Hand (DOH) was 94 and 79 days for 2022 and 2021, respectively, for finished goods, including consignment inventory. The increase in DOH is due to increased production to support sales growth of ICL products. 
 Shelf Registration 
 On May 6, 2020, STAAR filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC covering the future public offering and sale of up to 200 million in equity or debt securities or any combination of such securities. The shelf registration statement became effective on February 22, 2021 and expires on February 22, 2024. Among the purposes for which STAAR could use the proceeds of securities sold in the future under the shelf registration statement are working capital, capital expenditures, expansion of sales and marketing, and continuing research and development. STAAR could also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, assets, products, and technologies that are complementary to our own, although we are not currently contemplating or negotiating any such acquisitions or investments. The availability of financing in the public capital markets through the shelf registration statement depends on several factors in place at the time of financing, including the strength of STAAR s business performance, general economic conditions and investment climate, and investor perceptions of those factors. If STAAR seeks financing under the shelf registration statement in the future, we cannot assure that such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions. 
 We believe the following discussion represents our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 
 Sales Return Reserves 
 We provide allowances for sales returns such that returns are matched against the sales from which they originated. While such allowances have historically been within our expectations, we cannot guarantee that we will 
 38 
 
 continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past. Measurement of such returns is based on an expected loss model which requires consideration of, among other factors, historical returns experience and current/anticipated trends, including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines, the entry of a competitor, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data. We consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We account for the issuance of stock awards by estimating the fair value of awards issued using the Black-Scholes pricing model. This model s calculations include the exercise price, the market price of shares on grant date, risk-free interest rates, expected term of the award, expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield. For those awards which contain a performance condition, stock-based compensation cost will be recognized when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, net of an estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust stock-based compensation cost based on our probability assessment. 
 Income Taxes 
 In evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets within a jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including overall current and projected business and industry conditions, the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the successful implementation of feasible and prudent tax-planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to manage its businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we also consider three years of cumulative operating results. Valuation allowances, or reductions to deferred tax assets, are recognized if, based on the weight of all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. 
 Inventories 
 We provide estimated inventory allowances for excess, slow moving, expiring and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is more than net realizable value. These reserves are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months, estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months. Several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories, including significant changes in demand, decisions to exit a product line, technological change, and new product development. While such inventory losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past. 
 Lease Accounting 
 We recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms greater than twelve months. In recording a lease ROU asset, we consider the following lease extensions only if we are reasonably certain to extend the lease. For leases that increase using an inflation rate indicator, we use the inflation rate at the time the lease was entered into for the length of the lease term. In addition, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to record the lease ROU asset. 
 Investments Available for Sale 
 Investments available for sale are investments in debt securities for which the Company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are measured at fair value. We recognize impairment when there has been a decline in fair value below amortized cost if we intend to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The impairment related to credit losses is recognized in other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion of impairment not related to credit losses is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference between the 
 39 
 
 debt security s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security s effective yield. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and other long-lived assets (including property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets) are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance, plant closures, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the underlying assets and significant adverse industry or market economic trends. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make several assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios. 
 Employee Defined Benefit Plans - Pension 
 The liabilities and annual income or expense of our pension plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, expected years of service, salary increases and the expected long-term rate of asset return. The fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices. 
 Foreign Exchange 
 Management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected our ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future, which could significantly affect our operating results. We do not currently hedge transactions to offset changes in foreign currency. 
 Inflation 
 Management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on our net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations during the past three years. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 None. 

ITEM 7A. 
 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risks, opportunity, and costs and does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments. 
 Foreign currency risk 
 Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we transact business could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as a result, our sales benefit from a weaker dollar and are reduced by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide (primarily, the euro and the Japanese yen). Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations during any given reporting period result in the re-measurement of our foreign currency denominated cash, receivables, and payables, generating currency transaction gains or losses and are reported in total other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In the normal course of business, we also face risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable. Such risks include those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors .

ITEM 9A. 
 
 Controls and Procedures 

 Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of STAAR s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Controls and Procedures section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications. The report of BDO USA, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its audit of STAAR s internal control over financial reporting follows below. This section should be read in conjunction with the certifications and the BDO USA, LLP report for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded, as of the end of the period covered by our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2022, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. For purposes of this statement, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change during the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management, including our CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company. The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changing conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. The Company s processes contain self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2022.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 STAAR Surgical Company 
 Lake Forest, California 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited STAAR Surgical Company s (the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 STAAR Surgical Company 
 Lake Forest, California 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of STAAR Surgical Company (the Company as of December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Income Tax Provision 
 As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in multiple jurisdictions. The Company serves international markets and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, which affect the Company s provision for income taxes. The tax provision is based on management s understanding of current enacted tax laws and tax rates of each tax jurisdiction and assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In evaluating the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers the positive and negative evidence, including the reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. 
 F-2 
 
 We identified the Company s calculation of the provision for income taxes, including the judgment and estimation regarding projected taxable income as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations in our determination are the significant judgments required in the development of forecasts and certain assumptions related to the projected sales growth, margins, costs and income by jurisdiction that are used to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. These forecasts include certain assumptions including the likelihood of continued growth in certain key markets, projected industry-wide performance, macro-economic factors and the development and approval of new products. Auditing these elements involved especially complex auditor judgment due to the nature of audit evidence and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the need to involve personnel with specialized knowledge and skills. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 

Assessing the reasonableness of the Company s projected forecasts and certain related assumptions against the Company s historical performance, industry-wide performance, macro-economic factors, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 

Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in domestic and international tax law to assist in: (i) evaluating the application of tax laws used in management s allocation methodologies based on the Company s structure and operations, (ii) evaluating transfer pricing regulations to assist in assessing the appropriateness of intercompany transactions and the rates used to cross charge and allocate costs based on transfer pricing agreements, (iii) recalculating the income tax expense utilizing enacted tax rates, and (iv) evaluating both positive and negative evidence and assessing the reasonableness of certain assumptions used in the Company s valuation allowance assessment.

Since the payments for distinct or non-distinct services occur within the quarter corresponding with the purchases made by the customer and the shipments made by the Company to that customer, there is remaining performance obligation by the Company to the customer. Accordingly, there are deferred revenues associated with these types of arrangements as of December 30, 2022, December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021. and of the Company s consolidated trade receivables, respectively. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition are performed and, generally, no collateral is required. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, taken together, have not exceeded management s expectations.

The Company does not have any uncertain tax positions as of any of the periods presented. 
 On January 2, 2021 (beginning of fiscal year 2021), the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes the following exceptions: exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation exception to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and exception to interim period tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. ASU 2019-12 also improves financial reporting for franchise taxes that are partially based on income transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The Company s adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have material impact on Consolidated Financial Statements.

 to for executive officers and employees, and for members of its Board of Directors (the Board ). 
 The Company also, at times, issues restricted stock to its executive officers, employees and the Board, which are restricted and unvested common shares issued at fair market value on the date of grant. For the restricted shares issued to the Board, the restricted stock vests over a one-year service period, for executive officers and employees, it is typically a three-year service period, and are subject to forfeiture (or acceleration, depending upon the circumstances) until vested or the service period is completed. Restricted stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of to , based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. Restricted stock is considered legally issued and outstanding on the grant date. 
 The Company issues RSUs and PSUs, which can have only a service condition or a performance contingent restricted stock award based upon the Company meeting certain internally established performance conditions that vest only if those conditions are met or exceeded and the grantee is still employed with the Company. RSU and PSU compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes compensation cost for the performance condition RSUs and PSUs when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved, net of an estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures, over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts compensation cost based on its probability assessment. 
 Once the RSUs and PSUs are vested, equivalent common shares will be issued or issuable to the grantee and therefore the RSUs and PSUs are not included in total common shares issued and outstanding until vested.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the expected asset allocation and assumptions concerning long-term interest rates, inflation rates, and risk premiums for equities above the risk-free rates of return. These assumptions take into consideration historical long-term rates of return for relevant asset categories. 
 Under Swiss law, pension funds are legally independent from the employer and all the contributions are invested with regulated entities. The Company has a contract with Allianz Suisse Life Insurance Company s BVG Collective Foundation (the Foundation to manage its Swiss pension fund. Multiple employers contract with the Foundation to manage the employers respective pension plans. The Foundation manages the pension plans of its contracted employers as a collective entity. The investment strategy is determined by the Foundation and applies to all members of the collective Foundation. There are no separate financial statements for each employer contract. The pension plan assets of all the employers that contract with the Foundation are comingled. They are considered multiple-employer plans and therefore accounted for as single-employer plans.

 STAAR Japan administers the pension plan and funds the obligations of the Japan Plan from STAAR Japan s operating cash flows. STAAR Japan is not required, and does not intend, to provide contributions to the Plan to meet benefit obligations and therefore does not have any plan assets.

The Company is expected to incur through the end of 2023, one-time employee benefits of approximately related to this. These one-time employee benefits are recognized in general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company: (a) to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, except as prohibited by applicable law (b) to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified and (c) to make a good faith determination whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain directors and officers insurance. The Company currently has directors and officers liability insurance through a third-party carrier. Also, in connection with the sale of products and entering into business relationships in the ordinary course of business, the Company may make representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement as well as its negligence. The Company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions. 
 Tax Filings 
 The Company s tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in jurisdictions where it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. Management believes the Company has adequately provided for taxes however, final assessments, if any, could be significantly different than the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Employment Agreements 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer entered into an employment agreement with the Company, effective January 1, 2023. He and certain officers have as provisions of their agreements certain rights, including continuance of cash compensation and benefits, upon a change in control, which may include an acquisition of substantially all its assets, or termination without cause or for good reason as defined in the employment agreements. 
 Litigation and Claims 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and other matters arising in the normal course of business. These legal proceedings and other matters may relate to, among other things, contractual rights and obligations, employment matters, or claims of product liability. STAAR maintains insurance coverage for various matters, including product liability and certain securities claims. While the Company does not believe that any of the claims known is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations, new claims or unexpected results of existing claims could lead to significant financial harm.

 Paragraph: Exhibit A OPTION(S) TO EXTEND TERM. Subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of Paragraph 39, Lessor grants Lessee two (2) option(s) to extend the term of the Lease (" Extension Option(s) "), with each Extension Option being for a term of sixty (60) months, commencing when the prior term expires (" Option Term(s) "). In order to exercise an Extension Option, Lessee must give written notice of such election to Lessor and Lessor must receive such notice at least nine (9) but not more than twelve (12) months prior to the date that the applicable Option Term would commence, time being of the essence. If timely and proper notification of the exercise of an Extension Option is not given by Lessee and/or received by Lessor, such Extension Option shall automatically expire. Except as specifically modified, the terms, conditions and provisions of the Lease shall apply during Option Terms but the amount of Rent during Option Terms shall be established by using the method(s) selected below (check method(s) to be used and fill in appropriately) : 
 
 I. Consumer Price Index. 
 (a) During the Option Term(s) which start(s) on , the monthly Base Rent shall be increased on and every months therea ft er during such Option Te rm(s) ("Op ti on Term CPI Increase Date(s)") commensurate with the increase in the Option Term CPI (as herein defined) determined as follows: the monthly Base Rent scheduled for the month immediately preceding the first occurring Option Term CPI Increase Date shall be mul ti plied by a frac ti on the denominator of which is the Option Term Base CPI (as herein defined), and the numerator of which is the opti on Term Comparison CPI (as herein defined). The amount so calculated shall cons ti tute the new Base Rent un ti l the next opti on Term CPI Increase Date during the applicable opti on Term, but in no event shall any such new Base Rent be less than the Base Rent for the month immediately preceding the applicable Op ti on Term CPI Increase Date. 
 (b) The term "Op ti on Term CPI" shall mean the Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Sta ti s ti cs of the U.S. Department of Labor for (select one : CPI W (Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) or CPI U (All Urban Consumers), for (fill in Urban Area) : or the area in which the Premises is located, All Items (1982 1984 =100). The term " Option Term Comparison CPI" shall mean the CPI of the calendar month which is 2 full months prior to the applicable Option Term CPI Increase Date. The term " Option Term Base CPI" shall mean the CPI of the calendar month which is 2 full months prior to (select one) : Commencement Date of the Original Term, start of the applicable Option Term, or (fill in month) . 
 (c) If compila ti on and/or publica ti on of the CPI is transferred to another governmental department, bureau or agency or is discon ti nued, then instead the index most nearly the same as the CPI shall be used to calculate the Base Rent increases hereunder. If the Par ti es cannot agree on such alterna ti ve index, then the ma tte r shall be submi tt ed for decision to the American Arbitra ti on Associa ti on in accordance with the then rules of said associa ti on and the decision of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the par ti es, with the cost of such arbitra ti on being paid equally by the Par ti es. 
 II. Fixed Percentage. During the Option Term(s) which start(s) on , the monthly Base Rent shall be increased on and every months therea ft er during such Option Term(s) ("Op ti on Term Percentage Increase Date(s)") by percent of the monthly Base Rent scheduled to be paid for the month immediately preceding the applicable Op ti on Term Percentage Increase Date.

III . Fair Market Value. 
 (a) During the Option Term(s) which start(s) on July 1, 2033 and July 1, 2038 , the amount of Rent shall be the amount forecasted to be the fair market rental value of the Premises during such Option Term established pursuant to the procedures, terms, assumptions and conditions set forth herein " Fair Market Value " ; provided, however, regardless of such Fair Market Value, Base Rent during an Option Term shall not be less than the Base Rent scheduled as of when the prior term expires. Starting as of Lessee's exercise of the applicable Extension Option (but not earlier than six (6) months before start of the applicable Option Term), the parties shall for thirty (30) days " Negotiation Period " attempt to agree upon the Fair Market Value. If during the Negotiation Period the Parties do not agree on the Fair Market Value, then the Fair Market Value shall be established pursuant to the procedures set forth herein, which shall be binding. 
 (b) Each Party shall, within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Negotiation Period, in writing submit to the other Party such Party's determination of the Fair Market Value " Submitted Value(s) "). If a Party fails to timely provide a Submitted Value, then the other Party's Submitted Value shall be the Fair Market Value. If both parties timely provide Submitted Values, then each Party shall, within fifteen (15) days after both parties have exchanged Submitted Values, in writing notify the other Party of such Party's selected arbitrator who shall meet the qualifications set forth herein (" Advocate Arbitrator(s) "). Lessor and Lessee may select an Advocate Arbitrator who is favorable to such Party's position and may, prior to or after appointment of an Advocate Arbitrator, consult with such Party's Advocate Arbitrator. If a Party fails to timely and properly provide notice of such Party's chosen Advocate Arbitrator, then the other Party's Submitted Value shall be the Fair Market Value. 
 (c) If both parties timely and properly designate Advocate Arbitrators, then such Advocate Arbitrators shall, within fifteen (15) days after their selection, choose a third (3rd) neutral arbitrator who shall meet the qualifications set forth herein (" Neutral Arbitrator "). The Neutral Arbitrator shall be engaged jointly by Lessor and Lessee. If Advocate Arbitrators fail to agree upon and timely appoint a Neutral Arbitrator, then the President of AIR CRE shall appoint such Neutral Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after request by either Party. If the President of AIR CRE does not timely appoint the Neutral Arbitrator, then either Party may file an appropriate legal action for a judge with competent jurisdiction over the parties to appoint the Neutral Arbitrator. 
 (d) The Advocate Arbitrators and the Neutral Arbitrator (" Arbitrator(s) ") shall be duly licensed real estate brokers or salespersons in good standing in the state in which the Premises is located, shall have been active over the five (5) year period before their appointment in the leasing of properties similar to the Premises within the general real estate market of the Premises. The Neutral Arbitrator shall additionally not be related to or a liated with either Party or Advocate Arbitrator, and shall not have previously represented in a real estate transaction a Party or anyone related to or a liated with a Party. All matters to be determined by the Arbitrators shall be decided by a majority vote of the Arbitrators, with each Arbitrator having one (1) vote. The Arbitrators may, as the Arbitrators determine, hold hearings and require briefs, including market data and additional information. 
 (e) Within thirty (30) days after selection of the Neutral Arbitrator, the three Arbitrators shall first reach a decision as to their own independent opinion of the Fair Market Value established by taking into account the terms, assumptions and conditions set forth herein (" Arbitrators' Market Value "), then decide which Party's Submitted Value is closer in monetary amount to the Arbitrators' Market Value (" Selected Market Value "), then provide the parties a copy of the Arbitrators' Market Value and finally notify the parties of the Selected Market Value. The Selected Market Value shall be the Fair Market Value. The Arbitrators shall have no right to decide a Selected Market Value which is a compromise to (or modification of) the Submitted Values. The decision of the Arbitrators shall be binding upon the parties. The Party whose Submitted Value is not the Selected Market Value shall, within ten (10) days after the Arbitrators decide the Selected Market Value, pay the fees and costs of all three (3) Arbitrators. 
 (f) If the Fair Market Value has not been established before the start of the applicable Option Term, then Lessee shall continue to pay to Lessor rent in the amount payable for the month immediately preceding the start of such Option Term and Lessor's acceptance of such rent shall not waive, adversely a ect or prejudice the parties' right to complete establishment of the Fair Market Value or Lessor's right to collect the full amount of the Fair Market Value once the Fair Market Value is established. Lessee shall, within ten (10) days after establishment of the Fair Market Value, pay to Lessor any deficiency in rent then due for the Option Term. Following establishment of Fair Market Value, the parties shall, within ten (10) days after request by either Party, sign an amendment to this Lease to confirm the Fair Market Value and the expiration date of this Lease, but the parties' failure to request or to sign such an amendment shall not a ect establishment of the Fair Market Value or extension of the Lease term. 
 (g) The Arbitrators, in deciding the Arbitrators' Market Value, shall take into account rent rates, rent abatements, periodic rent increases, real property taxes, insurance premiums and other operating expenses, tenant improvement and other applicable allowances, building services, length of lease term and other factors professional real estate brokers and/or appraisers customarily consider in determining fair market rent of property in an arm's length transaction by ready, willing and able parties for space of comparable location, size, age, condition, quality, parking, visibility, view, signage and accessibility if the Premises were marketed in a normal and customary manner for a reasonable length of time on the open market to be leased to a tenant with financial strength and credit worthiness comparable to Lessee and guarantors (if any) of this Lease (as of Lessee's exercise of the Extension Option) for a term comparable to the length of the applicable Option Term and used for the Agreed Use (or other reasonably comparable uses). The Arbitrators, in deciding the Arbitrators' Market Value, shall not consider as a comparable transaction any of the following: a sublease, lease assignment, lease renewal or extension; lease with a tenant that has equity, is related to or a liated with the landlord; or a lease of space that was subject to a right of first refusal, right of first o er, expansion Option or other encumbrances. The Arbitrators, in deciding the Arbitrators' Market Value, shall reduce the Fair Market Value on account of alterations and improvements made by Lessee to the extent the cost thereof was paid solely by Lessee (in excess of any applicable improvement allowance, abated rent in lieu of improvement allowance or other consideration provided by Lessor for Lessee's improvement of the Premises), shall not reduce the Fair Market Value on account of any real estate brokerage commission savings by Lessor, and shall not reduce the Fair Market Value on account of deferred maintenance or repair of the Premises for which Lessee was responsible under the Lease but did not perform.

 Paragraph Exhibit : C 
 
 (a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 39 Lessee shall have a one-time right to lease (the "Right to Lease") the space described in subparagraph (b) if such space becomes available during the term of this Lease. 
 
 (b) This Right to Lease shall only apply to the following space in the Project: Units A12-A17 and Units B6-B19 (the " Additional Space "). 
 
 (c) Prior to o ering the Additional Space to anyone else Lessor shall give Lessee written notice of the availability of the Additional Space and the date the existing tenant or occupant, if any, is expected to vacate such space. For a period of three five business days following delivery of such notice, time being of the essence, Lessee shall have the right to request from Lessor a written statement setting forth the basic economic terms, including, but not limited to, Lessor's determination of the monthly Base Rent, an improvement allowance, if any, and all other economic terms and conditions (collectively, the "Economic Terms"), upon which Lessor is willing to lease the Additional Space. Lessee must make such request in writing. If Lessor has not received such a request from Lessee within such time period Lessee shall be conclusively presumed to have elected not to lease the Additional Space and Lessee's Right to Lease the Additional Space will thereafter be null and void and of no further force or e ect. 
 
 (d) In establishing the Economic Terms the Lessor will make a good faith determination of the fair market rental rate for the Additional Space. The term "fair market rental rate" as used in this subparagraph shall mean the rental rate that a willing, comparable, renewal tenant (excluding sublease and assignment transactions) would pay, and a willing owner of a comparable quality building located in the same vicinity would accept, for comparable space taking into account (i) the age, quality and layout of the existing improvements in the Additional Space, and (ii) items that real estate brokers customarily consider, including, but not limited to, rental rates, space availability, length of lease term, Lessee size, Lessee improvement allowances, operating expenses and allowance, and any other economic matters then being charged by Lessor or owners of similar buildings. In no event, however, shall the monthly Base Rent payable for the Additional Space be less, on a square foot basis, then the Base Rent payable with respect to the original Premises. 
 
 (e) For a period of three five business days after receipt of the Economic Terms from Lessor, time being of the essence, Lessee shall have the right to give written notice to Lessor of Lessee's exercise of its Right to Lease the Additional Space upon the Economic Terms and the same non-Economic Terms as set forth in this Lease with respect to the Premises. If Lessee timely exercises its Right to Lease as provided herein, the parties will promptly thereafter execute an amendment to this Lease to include the Additional Space in the Premises and to document the lease terms thereof. If Lessor has not received such notice from Lessee within such time period Lessee shall be conclusively presumed to have elected not to lease the Additional Space and Lessee's Right to Lease the Additional Space will thereafter be null and void and of no further force or e ect.
