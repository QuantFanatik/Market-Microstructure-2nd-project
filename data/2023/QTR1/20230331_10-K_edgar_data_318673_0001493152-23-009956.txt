Security
National Financial Corporation (the Company operates in three reportable business segments: life insurance, cemetery and
mortuary, and mortgages. The life insurance segment is engaged in the business of selling and servicing selected lines of life insurance,
annuity products, and accident and health insurance. These products are marketed in 40 states through a commissioned sales force of independent
licensed insurance agents who may also sell insurance products of other companies. The cemetery and mortuary segment consists of eight
mortuaries and five cemeteries in the state of Utah, one cemetery in the state of California, and one cemetery and four mortuaries in
the state of New Mexico. The Company also engages in pre-need selling of funeral, cemetery, mortuary, and cremation services through
its cemetery and mortuary locations. The mortgage segment originates and underwrites or otherwise purchases residential and commercial
loans for new construction, existing homes, and other real estate projects. The mortgage segment operates through 118 retail offices
in 26 states, and is an approved mortgage lender in several other states. 

The
Company s design and structure are that each business segment is related to the other business segments and contributes to the
profitability of the other segments. The Company s cemetery and mortuary segment provides a level of public awareness that assists
in the sales and marketing of insurance and pre-need cemetery and funeral products. The Company s insurance segment invests its
assets (including, in part, pre-need funeral products and services) in investments authorized by the respective insurance departments
of their states of domicile. The Company also pursues growth through acquisitions. The Company s mortgage segment provides mortgage
loans and other real estate investment opportunities. 

The
Company was organized as a holding company in 1979 when Security National Life Insurance Company Security National Life became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the former stockholders of Security National Life became stockholders of the Company.
Security National Life was formed in 1965 and has acquired or purchased significant blocks of business which include Capital Investors
Life Insurance Company (1994), Civil Service Employees Life Insurance Company (1995), Southern Security Life Insurance Company (1998),
Menlo Life Insurance Company (1999), Acadian Life Insurance Company (2002), Paramount Security Life Insurance Company (2004), Memorial
Insurance Company of America (2005), Capital Reserve Life Insurance Company (2007), Southern Security Life Insurance Company, Inc. (2008),
North America Life Insurance Company (2011, 2015), Trans-Western Life Insurance Company (2012), Mothe Life Insurance Company (2012),
DLE Life Insurance Company (2012), American Republic Insurance Company (2015), First Guaranty Insurance Company (2016), and Kilpatrick
Life Insurance Company (2019). In August 2021, the Company sold Memorial Insurance Company of America. 

The
cemetery and mortuary operations have also grown through the acquisition of other cemetery and mortuary companies. The cemetery and mortuary
companies that the Company has acquired are Holladay Memorial Park, Inc. (1991), Cottonwood Mortuary, Inc. (1991), Deseret Memorial,
Inc. (1991), Probst Family Funerals and Cremations L.L.C. (2019), Heber Valley Funeral Home, Inc. (2019), Rivera Funerals, Cremations
and Memorial Gardens (2021), and Holbrook Mortuary (2021). 

In
1993, the Company formed SecurityNational Mortgage Company SecurityNational Mortgage to originate and refinance residential
mortgage loans. In 2012, the Company formed Green Street Mortgage Services, Inc. (now known as EverLEND Mortgage Company) EverLEND
Mortgage also to originate and refinance residential mortgage loans. In December 2021, the Company ceased operations in EverLEND
Mortgage and merged its operations into SecurityNational Mortgage.

Life
Insurance 

Products 

The
Company, through Security National Life, First Guaranty Insurance Company First Guaranty ), and Kilpatrick Life Insurance
Company Kilpatrick ), issues and distributes selected lines of life insurance and annuities. The Company s life insurance
business includes funeral plans and interest-sensitive life insurance, as well as other traditional life, accident, and health insurance
products. The Company places specific marketing emphasis on funeral plans through pre-need planning. The Company s insurance subsidiaries,
Southern Security Life Insurance Company, Inc. Southern Security and Trans-Western Life Insurance Company Trans-Western ),
do not actively write policies, but service and maintain policies that were purchased prior to their acquisition by Security National
Life. 

A
funeral plan is a small face value life insurance policy that generally has face coverage of up to 30,000. The Company believes that
funeral plans represent a marketing niche that has lower competition because most insurance companies do not offer similar coverage.
The purpose of the funeral plan policy is to pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person s death. On a per thousand-dollar
cost of insurance basis, these policies can be more expensive to the policyholder than many types of non-burial insurance due to their
low face amount, requiring the fixed cost of the policy administration to be distributed over a smaller policy size, and the simplified
underwriting practices that result in higher mortality costs. 

Markets
and Distribution 

The
Company is licensed to sell insurance in 40 states. The Company, in marketing its life insurance products, seeks to locate, develop and
service specific niche markets. The Company s funeral plan policies are sold primarily to persons who range in age from 45 to 85
and have low to moderate income. A majority of the Company s funeral plan premiums come from the states of Arkansas, California,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Utah. 

The
Company sells its life insurance products through direct agents, brokers, and independent licensed agents who may also sell insurance
products of other companies. The commissions on life insurance products range from approximately 50 to 120 of first year premiums.
In those cases where the Company utilizes its direct agents in selling such policies, those agents customarily receive advances against
future commissions. 

In
some instances, funeral plan insurance is marketed in conjunction with the Company s cemetery and mortuary sales force. When it
is marketed by that group, the beneficiary is usually the Company s cemeteries and mortuaries. Thus, death benefits that become
payable under the policy are paid to the Company s cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries to the extent of services performed and products
purchased. 

In
marketing funeral plan insurance, the Company also seeks and obtains third-party endorsements from other cemeteries and mortuaries within
its marketing areas. Typically, these cemeteries and mortuaries will provide letters of endorsement and may share in mailing and other
lead-generating costs since these businesses are usually made the beneficiary of the policy. The following table summarizes the life
insurance business for the five years ended December 31, 2022:

Underwriting 

The
factors considered in evaluating an application for ordinary life insurance coverage can include the applicant s age, occupation,
general health, and medical history. Upon receipt of a satisfactory (non-funeral plan insurance) application, which contains pertinent
medical questions, the Company issues insurance based upon its medical limits and requirements subject to the following general non-medical
limits: 

Age
 Nearest Birthday 
 Non-Medical
 Limits 

0-50 
 100,000 
 
 51-up 
 Medical
 information 

required
 (APS or exam) 

When
underwriting life insurance, the Company will sometimes issue policies with higher premium rates for substandard risks. 

The
Company s funeral plan insurance is written on a simplified medical application with underwriting requirements being a completed
application, a phone interview of the applicant, and an intelliscript prescription history inquiry. There are several underwriting classes
in which an applicant can be placed. 

Annuities 

Products 

The
Company s annuity business includes single premium deferred annuities, flexible premium deferred annuities, and immediate annuities.
A single premium deferred annuity is a contract where the individual remits a sum of money to the Company, which is retained on deposit
until such time as the individual may wish to annuitize or surrender the contract for cash. A flexible premium deferred annuity gives
the contract holder the right to make premium payments of varying amounts or to make no further premium payments after his initial payment.
These single and flexible premium deferred annuities can have initial surrender charges. The surrender charges act as a deterrent to
individuals who may wish to prematurely surrender their annuity contracts. An immediate annuity is a contract in which the individual
remits a sum of money to the Company in return for the Company s obligation to pay a series of payments on a periodic basis over
a designated period of time, such as an individual s life, or for such other period as may be designated. 

Annuities
have guaranteed interest rates that range from 1 to 6.5 per annum. Rates above the guaranteed interest rate credited are periodically
modified by the Board of Directors at its discretion. In order for the Company to realize a profit on an annuity product, the Company
must maintain an interest rate spread between its investment income and the interest rate credited to the annuities. Commissions, issuance
expenses, and general and administrative expenses are deducted from this interest rate spread. 

Markets
and Distribution 

The
general market for the Company s annuities is middle to older age individuals. A major source of annuity sales come from direct
agents and are sold in conjunction with other insurance sales. If an individual does not qualify for a funeral plan, the agent will often
sell that individual an annuity to fund final expenses.

Reinsurance 

The
primary purpose of reinsurance is to enable an insurance company to issue an insurance policy in an amount larger than the risk the insurance
company is willing to assume for itself. The insurance company remains obligated for the amounts reinsured (ceded) in the event the reinsurers
do not meet their obligations. 

The
Company currently cedes and assumes certain risks with various authorized unaffiliated reinsurers pursuant to reinsurance treaties, which
are generally renewed annually. The premiums paid by the Company are based on a number of factors, primarily including the age of the
insured and the risk ceded to the reinsurer. 

It
is the Company s policy to retain no more than 100,000 of ordinary insurance per insured life, with the excess risk being reinsured.
The total amount of life insurance reinsured by other companies as of December 31, 2022, was 346,749,000, which represented approximately
12.1 of the Company s life insurance in force on that date. 

See
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional disclosure and discussion regarding reinsurance. 

Investments 

The
investments that support the Company s life insurance and annuity obligations are determined by the investment committees of the
Company s subsidiaries and ratified by the full boards of directors of the respective subsidiaries. A significant portion of the
Company s investments must meet statutory requirements governing the nature and quality of permitted investments by its insurance
subsidiaries. The Company maintains a diversified investment portfolio consisting of common stocks, preferred stocks, municipal bonds,
corporate bonds, mortgage loans, real estate, and other securities and investments.

Cemetery
and Mortuary 

Products 

Through
its cemetery and mortuary segment, the Company markets a variety of products and services both on a pre-need basis (prior to death) and
an at-need basis (at the time of death). The products include: plots, interment vaults, mausoleum crypts, markers, caskets, urns and
other death care related products. These services include: professional services of funeral directors, opening and closing of graves,
use of chapels and viewing rooms, and use of automobiles and clothing. The Company has a mortuary at each of its cemeteries, other than
Holladay Memorial Park and Singing Hills Memorial Park, and has six separate stand-alone mortuary facilities. 

Markets
and Distribution 

The
Company s pre-need cemetery and mortuary sales are marketed to persons of all ages but are generally purchased by persons 45 years
of age and older. The Company is limited in its geographic distribution of these products to areas lying within an approximate 20-mile
radius of its mortuaries and cemeteries. The Company s at-need sales are similarly limited in geographic area. 

The
Company actively seeks to sell its cemetery and funeral products to customers on a pre-need basis. The Company employs cemetery sales
representatives on a commission basis to sell these products. Many of these pre-need cemetery and mortuary sales representatives are
also licensed insurance salesmen and sell funeral plan insurance. In some instances, the Company s cemetery and mortuary facilities
are the named beneficiaries of the funeral plan policies. 

Potential
customers are located via telephone sales prospecting, responses to letters mailed by the pre-planning consultants, billboards and other
outside advertising, referrals, and door-to-door canvassing. The Company trains its sales representatives and helps generate leads for
them.

Real
Estate Development 

The
Company is capitalizing on the opportunity to develop commercial and residential assets on its existing properties. The cost to acquire
existing for-sale assets currently exceeds the replacement costs, thus creating the opportunity for development and redevelopment of
the land that the Company currently owns. The Company has developed, or is in the process of developing, assets that have an initial
development cost exceeding 100,000,000, primarily relating to the Center53 Development. The Company plans to continue its development
endeavors as based upon its assessment of the market demand. 

Center53
Development 

Center53
Development is an office development project comprising nearly 20 acres of land that is currently owned by the Company in the central
valley of Salt Lake City. At final completion, the multi-year, phased development is expected to create a campus atmosphere and include
nearly one million square-feet of office space in five buildings, ranging from four to eleven stories, and will be serviced by three
parking structures with about 4,000 stalls. In 2015, the Company broke ground and commenced development on the first phase which included
a six-story building of nearly 200,000 square feet and a parking garage with 748 parking stalls. The first phase of the project was completed
in July 2017 and is currently 100 leased. The second phase of the project began in March 2020 and includes a second six story building
of nearly 221,000 square feet and a parking garage with approximately 870 stalls. The Company began its occupancy of a portion of the
building in October 2021 and the remainder of the building is currently 100 leased. The Company plans to initiate future phases of the
Center53 Development for additional Class A office space in the central valley of Salt Lake City.

Regulation 

The
Company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which they do business under statutes
and regulations administered by state insurance commissioners. Such regulation relates to, among other things, prior approval of the
acquisition of a controlling interest in an insurance company; standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; licensing of insurers
and their agents; nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy
forms and premium rates; periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on
the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; and requirements regarding aggregate reserves for life policies and annuity
contracts, policy claims, unearned premiums, and other matters. The Company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to this type of
regulation in any state in which they conduct relevant business. Such regulation may cause unforeseen costs and operational restrictions,
and delay implementation of the Company s business plans. 

The
Company s life insurance subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation in Utah, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas under insurance
holding company legislation, and other states where applicable. Generally, intercompany transfers of assets and dividend payments from
insurance subsidiaries are subject to prior notice of approval from the relevant state insurance department where, they are deemed extraordinary 
under relevant state law. The insurance subsidiaries are required, under state insurance laws, to file detailed annual reports with the
supervisory agencies in each of the states in which they do business. Their business and accounts are also subject to examination by
these agencies. The Company was last examined in 2021 (First Guaranty Insurance), 2022 (Security National Life, Southern Security and
Trans-Western) and 2021 (Kilpatrick Life). Its most recent final examination reports have been approved by the insurance departments
and are public record. 

The
Texas Department of Banking also audits pre-need insurance policies that are issued in the state of Texas. Pre-need policies include
the life and annuity products sold as the funding mechanism for funeral plans through funeral homes by Security National agents. The
Company is required to send the Texas Department of Banking an annual report that summarizes the number of policies in force and the
face amount or death benefit for each policy. This annual report is also required to indicate the number of new policies issued for that
year, all death claims paid that year, and all premiums received. 

The
Company s cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Trade Commission s comprehensive funeral industry
rules and to state regulations in the various states where such operations are domiciled. The morticians must be licensed by the respective
state in which they provide their services. Similarly, the mortuaries and cemeteries are governed and licensed by state statutes and
city ordinances in Utah, California and New Mexico. The subsidiaries are required to keep annual reports on file including financial
information concerning the number of spaces sold and, where applicable, funds provided to the Endowment Care Trust Fund. Licenses are
issued annually on the basis of such reports. The cemeteries maintain city or county licenses where they conduct business. 

The
Company s mortgage subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), and to various state licensing acts and regulations and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). These regulations, among
other things, specify minimum capital requirements and; procedures for loan origination and underwriting, licensing of brokers and loan
officers and, quality review audits and specify the fees that can be charged to borrowers. Each year, the Company is required to have
an audit completed for each mortgage subsidiary by an independent registered public accounting firm to verify compliance with the relevant
regulations. In addition to the government regulations, the Company must meet loan requirements, and underwriting guidelines of various
investors who purchase the loans. EverLEND Mortgage is not required to have an audit for 2021 since it ceased operations in December
2021. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company s insurance subsidiaries, Security National Life, First Guaranty and Kilpatrick, are taxed under the Life Insurance Company
Tax Act of 1984. Under the act, life insurance companies are taxed at standard corporate rates on life insurance company taxable income.
Life insurance company taxable income is gross income less general business deductions and reserves for future policyholder benefits
(with modifications). Under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, December 31, 2017 policyholder surplus account balances result in taxable income
over a period of eight years. 

Security
National Life, First Guaranty and Kilpatrick calculate their life insurance taxable income after establishing a provision representing
a portion of the costs of acquisition of such life insurance business. The effect of the provision is that a certain percentage of the
Company s premium income is characterized as deferred expenses and recognized over a five or ten-year period. The Tax Act changed
this recognition period for amounts deferred after December 31, 2017 to a five or fifteen-year period. 

The
Company s non-life insurance company subsidiaries are taxed in general under the regular corporate tax provisions. The Company s
subsidiaries Southern Security and Trans-Western are regulated as life insurance companies but do not meet the Internal Revenue Code
definition of a life insurance company, so they are taxed as insurance companies other than life insurance companies. 

9 

Competition 

The
life insurance industry is highly competitive. There are approximately 800 legal reserve life insurance companies in business in the
United States. These insurance companies differentiate themselves through marketing techniques, product features, pricing, and customer
service. The Company s insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of insurance companies, many of which have greater financial
resources, a longer business history, and more diversified line of insurance products than the Company. In addition, such companies generally
have a larger sales force. Further, the Company competes with mutual insurance companies which may have a competitive advantage because
all profits accrue to policyholders. Because the Company is smaller by industry standards and lacks broad diversification of risk, it
may be more vulnerable to losses than larger, better-established companies. The Company believes that its policies and rates for the
markets it serves are generally competitive. 

The
cemetery and mortuary industry is also highly competitive. In the Utah, California and New Mexico markets where the Company competes,
there are a number of cemeteries and mortuaries which have longer business histories, more established positions in the community, and
stronger financial positions than the Company. In addition, some of the cemeteries with which the Company must compete for sales are
owned by municipalities and, as a result, can offer lower prices than can the Company. The Company bears the cost of a pre-need sales
program that is not incurred by those competitors which do not have a pre-need sales force. The Company believes that its products and
prices are generally competitive with those in the industry. 

The
mortgage industry is highly competitive with a large number of mortgage companies and banks in the same geographic area in which the
Company is operating. The mortgage industry in general is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the refinancing market is particularly
vulnerable to changes in interest rates. 

Human
Capital Management 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 1,422 full-time and 202 part-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 934 were employed
by the mortgage segment, 368 by the life insurance segment, and 120 by the cemetery and mortuary segment. The Company requires monthly
acknowledgement of its anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies and communicates to its employees how to report concerns that
relate to their employment experience. 

Employee
Benefits 

All
eligible employees may elect coverage under the Company s group health (including health savings and flexible spending), retirement,
supplemental life and voluntary benefit programs. As of December 31, 2022, 826 employees had elected to participate in the Company s
group health insurance plans. 

The
Company has an employee safe harbor retirement plan that qualifies under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and contributes
a matching contribution based on the employee s contribution and years of service. 

The
Company provides other time off benefits such as paid sick and paid vacation time. The Company provides discounts on pre-need and death
benefits to tenured employees. Additionally, the Company offers an employee assistance program that provides 24/7 counseling services
for employees who may be facing challenges outside of the workplace.

The
Company s Class A common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol SNFCA. As of March 27,
2023, the closing stock price of the Class A common stock was 6.09 per share. As of March 27, 2023, there were 1,801 registered stockholders
of record of the Company s Class A common stock and 44 registered stockholders of record of the Company s Class C common
stock. Because many of the Company s shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of the
stockholders, the Company is unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Stock prices have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of annual stock dividends. 

The
Class C common stock is not registered or traded on a national exchange. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The
Company has never paid a cash dividend on its Class A or Class C common stock. The Company currently anticipates that all of its earnings
will be retained for use in the operation and expansion of its business and does not intend to pay any cash dividends on its Class A
or Class C common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to cash dividends will depend upon the earnings and financial
position of the Company and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate. The Company paid a 5 stock dividend on
Class A and Class C common stock each year from 1990 through 2019, a 7.5 stock dividend for year 2020, and a 5.0 stock dividend for
the years 2021 and 2022.

is subject to the daily time, price and volume conditions of Rule 10b-18. The initial term of the agreement is for one year and may be

 authorized the repurchase of 300,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock in

 authorized the repurchase of a total of 1,000,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

The
Company s operations over the last several years generally reflect three strategies which the Company expects to continue: (i)
increased attention to niche insurance products, such as the Company s funeral plan policies and traditional whole
life products; (ii) increased emphasis on cemetery and mortuary business; and (iii) capitalizing on the housing market by originating
mortgage loans. The Company has adjusted its strategies to respond to the changing economic circumstances resulting from COVID-19.

decrease in gains on investments and other assets primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of equity securities, (b) a 3,345,000
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, (c) a 2,596,000 increase in future policy benefits, (d) a 1,741,000 increase
in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of deferred policy
and pre-need acquisition costs, (e) a 1,641,000 increase in interest expense, (f) a 968,000 decrease in intersegment revenue, and (g)
a 220,000 decrease in other revenues, which were partially offset by (i) a 6,473,000 increase in net investment income, (ii) a 4,890,000
increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, (iii) a 3,152,000 decrease in death, surrenders and other policy benefits,
and (iv) a 193,000 decrease in intersegment interest expense and other expenses. 

In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company s life insurance sales force began using virtual and tele sales processes to market
products. During the third quarter 2021, the life insurance sales force returned to in person sales, however, it continues to use virtual
and tele sales where needed. Currently, approximately 75 of insurance operations office staff work in the office with the flexibility
for hybrid-remote or completely remote working arrangements as needed.

In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cemetery and mortuary s pre-need sales force began using virtual selling processes to market
its products and services including some in home sales as local regulations permitted. During the third quarter 2021, the sales force
returned mostly to in home sales, however, it continues to use virtual selling where needed. Currently, the cemetery and mortuary operations
office staff works in the office with the flexibility for hybrid-remote or completely remote working arrangements as needed. 

Mortgage
Operations 

The
Company s wholly owned subsidiary, SecurityNational Mortgage, is a mortgage lender incorporated under the laws of the State of
Utah and approved and regulated by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a department of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), which originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower, in addition
to various conventional mortgage loan products. SecurityNational Mortgage originates and refinances mortgage loans on a retail basis.
Mortgage loans originated or refinanced by the Company s mortgage subsidiaries are funded through loan purchase agreements with
Security National Life, Kilpatrick Life and unaffiliated financial institutions. 

SecurityNational
Mortgage receives fees from borrowers that are involved in mortgage loan originations and refinancings, and secondary fees earned from
third party investors that purchase the mortgage loans. Mortgage loans are generally sold with mortgage servicing rights MSRs released to third-party investors or retained by SecurityNational Mortgage. SecurityNational Mortgage currently retains the MSRs on approximately
7 of its loan origination volume. These mortgage loans are serviced by either SecurityNational Mortgage or an approved third-party sub-servicer.
In December 2021, the Company ceased operations in EverLEND Mortgage and merged its operations into SecurityNational Mortgage. On October
31, 2022, the Company sold certain of its MSRs. The MSRs related to mortgage loans previously originated by the Company in aggregate
unpaid principal amount of approximately 7.02 billion. As a result of the sale, the book value of the Company s MSRs decreased
 51,185,906 and generated a gain of 34,051,938 included in mortgage fee income on the consolidated statements of earnings. 

20 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, SecurityNational Mortgage originated 10,663 loans 3,373,554,000 total volume) and
19,342 loans 5,502,894,000 total volume), respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, EverLEND Mortgage originated
323 loans 108,295,000 total volume). 

Mortgage
rates have followed the US Treasury yields up in response to the higher than expected inflation and the expectation that the Federal
Reserve will continue to raise rates in the near term. As expected, the rapid increase in mortgage rates has resulted in a decrease in
loan originations classified as refinance . Higher mortgage rates have also had a negative effect on loan originations classified
as purchase , although not as significant as those in the refinance classification.

In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortgage operations has integrated employee work from home accommodations into its standard operating
procedures. A large percentage of fulfillment employees are in office however the flexibility remains to accommodate in office or work
from home functionality. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
following is a brief summary of the Company s significant accounting policies and a review of the Company s most critical
accounting estimates. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Insurance
Operations 

In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), premiums and other considerations
received for interest sensitive products are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues.
Revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance, administration charges, amortization of policy
initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances. Surrender benefits paid relating to these products
are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses. 

21 

The
Company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances, a portion of which is passed through to the
policyholders in the form of interest credited. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder
account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements. 

Premiums
and other considerations received for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due. Future policy benefits
are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits. 

The
costs related to acquiring new business, including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses (principally
commissions), defined as deferred policy acquisition costs, are capitalized and amortized into expense. For nonparticipating traditional
life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of annual
premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumptions used
for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued. For
interest sensitive products, these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment,
mortality and expense margins. This amortization is adjusted when the Company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits
or margins. For example, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are
higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated
maturity. 

Death
and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under
insurance retention limits. The profitability of the Company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality, other policyholder benefits,
expense levels, interest spreads (i.e., the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders)
and persistency. The Company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting, asset and liability duration
matching, sound actuarial practices, adjustments to credited interest rates, policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges. 

Cemetery
and Mortuary Operations 

Pre-need
sales of funeral services and caskets, including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need funeral services and caskets,
are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered. 

Pre-need
sales of cemetery interment rights (cemetery burial property), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery
interment rights, are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of GAAP. Under GAAP, recognition of revenue and
associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected.
Revenues related to the pre-need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets
the criteria of GAAP, described above. 

Pre-need
sales of cemetery merchandise (primarily markers and vaults), including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery
merchandise, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered, fulfilling the performance obligation. 

Pre-need
sales of cemetery services (primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees), including revenue
and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery services, are deferred until the services are performed. 

Prearranged
funeral and pre-need cemetery customer obtaining costs, including costs incurred related to obtaining new pre-need cemetery and prearranged
funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of GAAP. Obtaining costs, which include only costs that vary
with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre-need cemetery and prearranged funeral business, are deferred until the merchandise
is delivered or services are performed. 

Revenues
and costs for at-need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists, the services are performed, collection is reasonably assured,
and there are no significant company obligations remaining. 

22 

Mortgage
Operations 

Mortgage
fee income consists of origination fees, processing fees, interest income and certain other income related to the origination and sale
of mortgage loans. The Company has elected to use fair value accounting for all mortgage loans that are held for sale. Accordingly, all
revenues and costs are now recognized when the mortgage loan is funded and any changes in fair value are shown as a component of mortgage
fee income. 

The
Company, through its mortgage subsidiaries, sells mortgage loans to third-party investors without recourse, unless defects are identified
in the representations and warranties made at loan sale. It may be required, however, to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase
under certain events, which include the following: 

Failure
 to deliver original documents specified by the investor, 

The
 existence of misrepresentation or fraud in the origination of the loan, 

The
 loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold, 

Early
 pay-off of a loan, as defined by the agreements, 

Excessive
 time to settle a loan, 

Investor
 declines purchase, and 

Discontinued
 product and expired commitment. 

Loan
purchase commitments generally specify a date 30 to 45 days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled. Depending
on market conditions, these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the Company. 

It
is the Company s policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six-month time period
and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third-party investors concerning the loans. The Company believes that
six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues, to enforce purchase commitments, and to exhaust other alternatives.
Remedial methods include the following: 

Research
 reasons for rejection, 

Provide
 additional documents, 

Request
 investor exceptions, 

Appeal
 rejection decision to purchase committee, and 

Commit
 to secondary investors. 

Once
purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted, which could be earlier than the six-month time period,
the loans are repurchased and transferred to mortgage loans held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value and the previously
recorded sales revenue that was to be received from a third-party investor is written off against the loan loss reserve. Any loan that
later becomes delinquent is evaluated by the Company at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly. 

Determining
fair value . Cost for loans held for sale is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the
Company. Market value, while often difficult to determine and may contain significant unobservable inputs, is based on the following
guidelines: 

For
 loans that are committed, the Company uses the commitment price. 

For
 loans that are non-committed that have an active market, the Company uses the market price. 

For
 loans that are non-committed where there is no market but there is a similar product, the Company uses the market value for the similar
 product. 

For
 loans that are non-committed where no active market exists, the Company determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates
 the market value, after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral, estimated future cash flows, and loan
 interest rate. 

23 

The
appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to the Company s determination of fair
value because, if the loan becomes delinquent, the Company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying
value of the loan, thus minimizing credit risk. 

The
majority of loans originated are sold to third-party investors. The amounts expected to be sold to investors are shown on the consolidated
balance sheets as loans held for sale. 

Use
of Significant Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts and disclosures. It is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which
could have a material impact on the financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates, and critical
issues that impact them: 

Loan
Commitments 

The
Company estimates the fair value of a mortgage loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage
loan, quoted mortgage-backed security MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate
of the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the commitment net of estimated commission expense. The change
in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the mortgage loan commitment is issued and is shown net of related
expenses. Following issuance, the value of a loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the change in value of
the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company s recent historical data are used to estimate the
quantity and value of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the commitments. 

Deferred
Acquisition Costs 

Amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future
gross profits or margins on this business. Key assumptions used include the following: yield on investments supporting the liabilities,
amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies, amount of policy fees and charges, amount of expenses necessary to maintain
the policies, amount of death and surrender benefits, and the length of time the policies will stay in force. 

For
nonparticipating traditional life products, these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion
to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues. Such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using
the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the
policies are issued. 

Value
of Business Acquired 

Value
of business acquired VOBA is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized
similar to deferred acquisition costs. The critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business
acquired. 

Mortgage
Loans Foreclosed to Real Estate Held for Investment or Sale 

These
properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon foreclosure. The Company believes that in an orderly market, fair value
approximates the replacement cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes
the highest and best use of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company s intent to hold the properties
as rental properties, matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for estimated future policy
benefits. Accordingly, the fair value determination is generally weighted more heavily toward the rental analysis. The fair value is
also estimated by obtaining an independent appraisal, which typically considers area comparable properties and property condition. 

24 

Future
Policy Benefits 

Reserves
for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions, including the duration of the
policies, mortality experience, expenses, investment yield, lapse rates, surrender rates, and dividend crediting rates. 

These
assumptions are made based upon historical experience, industry standards and a best estimate of future results and, for traditional
life products, include a provision for adverse deviation. For traditional life insurance, once established for a particular series of
products, these assumptions are generally held constant. 

Unearned
Premium Reserve 

The
universal life products the Company sells have significant policy initiation fees (front-end load) that are deferred and amortized into
revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and expense margins. The same issues
that impact deferred acquisition costs apply to unearned revenue. 

Premium
Deficiency and Loss Recognition Testing 

At
least annually, the Company tests the adequacy of the net benefit reserves (liability for future policy benefits, net of DAC and VOBA)
recorded for life insurance and annuity products. The Company tests for recoverability by using the Company s current best-estimate
assumptions as to policyholder mortality, persistency, maintenance expenses and invested asset returns. These tests evaluate whether
the present value of future contract-related cash flows will support the capitalized DAC and VOBA assets. These cash flows consist primarily
of premium income, less benefits and expenses. If the current contract liabilities plus the present value of future premiums is greater
than the sum of the present values of future policy benefits, commissions, and expenses plus the current DAC and VOBA less unearned premium
reserve balances, then the capitalized assets are deemed recoverable. The present values are calculated using the best estimate of the
after tax net investment earned rate. 

Deferred
Pre-need Cemetery and Funeral Contracts Revenues and Estimated Future Cost of Pre-need Sales 

The
revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is
delivered or the service is performed. 

The
Company, through its cemetery and mortuary operations, provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive
future goods and services at guaranteed prices. To accomplish this, the Company, through its life insurance operations, sells to the
customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries. If, at the time of need, the policyholder or
potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the Company s facilities, the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been
assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price. The increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference
between the original contract prices and current prices. Risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance
policy. 

Mortgage
Servicing Rights 

Mortgage
Service Rights MSR arise from contractual agreements between the Company and third-party investors (or their agents)
when mortgage loans are sold. Under these contracts, the Company is obligated to retain and provide loan servicing functions on the loans
sold, in exchange for fees and other remuneration. The servicing functions typically performed include, among other responsibilities,
collecting and remitting loan payments; responding to borrower inquiries; accounting for principal and interest; holding custodial (impound)
funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising the acquisition of real
estate owned and property dispositions. The Company initially accounts for MSRs at fair value and subsequently accounts for them using
the amortization method. MSR amortization is determined by amortizing the MSR balance in proportion to, and over the period of the estimated
future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. The Company periodically assesses MSRs accounted for using the amortization
method for impairment. 

25 

Mortgage
Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Reserve 

The
Company provides for losses on its mortgage loans held for investment through an allowance for loan losses (a contra-asset account) and
through the mortgage loan loss reserve (a liability account). The allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the Company s
mortgage loans held for investment. The allowance is comprised of two components. The first component is an allowance for collectively
evaluated impairment that is based upon the Company s historical experience in collecting similar receivables. The second component
is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired. 

Upon
determining impairment, the Company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the
underlying collateral. In addition, when a mortgage loan is past due more than 90 days, the Company does not accrue any interest income.
When a loan becomes delinquent, the Company proceeds to foreclose on the real estate and all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as
incurred. Once foreclosed, an adjustment for the lower of cost or fair value is made, if necessary, and the amount is classified as real
estate held for investment. The Company will rent the properties until it is deemed desirable to sell them. 

The
mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company will realize in the future on
mortgage loans sold to third-party investors. The Company may be required to reimburse third-party investors for costs associated with
early payoff of loans within six months of origination of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first
four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company s estimates
are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities. 

Upon
completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale, the Company initially measures at fair value liabilities
incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions in the event of defects in the representations and warranties made
at loan sale. The Company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production. This estimate
is based on the Company s historical experience and is included as a component of mortgage fee income. Subsequent updates to the
recorded liability from changes in assumptions are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The estimated liability
for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses. 

The
Company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet
date. 

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities 

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities require various estimates and judgments and may be affected favorably or unfavorably by various internal and
external factors. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from
temporary differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and in estimating the ultimate
amount of deferred tax assets recoverable in future periods. Factors affecting the deferred tax assets and liabilities include, but are
not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, and changes
to overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Changes in these estimates, judgments or factors may result in an increase or decrease to the
Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities with a related increase or decrease in the Company s provision for income taxes. 

Results
of Consolidated Operations 

2022
Compared to 2021 

Total
revenues decreased by 81,043,000, or 17.2 , to 389,652,000 for 2022 from 470,695,000 for the fiscal year 2021. Contributing to this
decrease in total revenues was a 89,918,000 decrease in mortgage fee income and a 7,123,000 decrease in gains on investments and other
assets and other than temporary impairments. This decrease in total revenues was offset by a 7,933,000 increase in net investment income,
a 4,747,000 increase in insurance premiums and other considerations, a 2,997,000 increase in net cemetery and mortuary sales, a 281,000
increase in other revenues, and a 40,000 decrease in other than temporary impairments. 

26 

Mortgage
fee income decreased by 89,918,000, or 34.1 , to 173,500,000 for 2022, from 263,418,000 for 2021. This decrease was primarily due
to a 76,546,000 decrease in secondary gains from mortgage loans sold to third-party investors into the secondary market, a 13,258,000
decrease in loan fees and interest income, a 1,247,000 decrease in the fair value of loans held for sale and loan commitments. This
decrease in mortgage fee income was partially offset by a 1,133,000 decrease in the provision for loan loss reserve. 

Insurance
premiums and other considerations increased by 4,747,000, or 4.7 , to 105,002,000 for 2022, from 100,255,000 for 2021. This increase
was due to an increase of 2,253,000 in renewal premiums due to the growth of the Company in recent years, particularly in whole life
products, which resulted in more premium paying policies in force and an increase of 2,494,000 in first year premiums as a result of
increased final expense insurance sales. 

Net
investment income increased by 7,933,000, or 13.6 , to 66,198,000 for 2022, from 58,265,000 for 2021. This increase was primarily
attributable to a 6,191,000 increase in mortgage loan interest, a 2,228,000 increase in rental income from real estate held for investment,
a 1,626,000 increase in fixed maturity securities income, a 1,431,000 increase in interest on cash and cash equivalents, a 388,000
increase in income in other investments, and a 65,000 increase in equity securities income. This increase was partially offset by a
 3,039,000 increase in investment expenses, a 949,000 decrease in insurance assignment income, and an 8,000 decrease in policy loan
income. 

Net
mortuary and cemetery sales increased by 2,997,000, or 12.5 , to 26,994,000 for 2022, from 23,997,000 for 2021. This increase was
primarily due to a 4,751,000 increase in mortuary at-need sales and a 311,000 increase in cemetery at-need sales. This increase was
partially offset by a 2,065,000 decrease in cemetery pre-need sales 

Gains
on investments and other assets decreased by 7,123,000, or 113.7 , to 858,000 in losses for 2022, from 6,265,000 in gains for 2021.
This decrease in gains on investments and other assets was primarily due to a 5,243,000 decrease in gains on equity securities mostly
attributable to decreases in the fair value of these equity securities, a 1,197,000 decrease in gains on other assets mostly attributable
to a decrease in gains recognized on the sale of mortgage loans held for investment, and a 683,000 decrease in gains on fixed maturity
securities. 

Other
revenues increased by 282,000, or 1.5 , to 18,817,000 for 2022 from 18,535,000 for 2021. This increase was primarily attributable
to an increase in servicing fee revenue. 

Total
benefits and expenses were 355,275,000, or 91.2 of total revenues for 2022, as compared to 418,895,000, or 89.0 of total revenues
for 2021. 

Death
benefits, surrenders and other policy benefits, and future policy benefits decreased by an aggregate of 556,000, or 0.6 , to 92,926,000
for 2022, from 93,482,000 for 2021. This decrease was primarily the result of a 3,870,000 decrease in death benefits 4,296,000 for
COVID-19 related deaths). This decrease was partially offset by a 2,596,000 increase in future policy benefits and a 718,000 increase
in surrender and other policy benefits. 

Amortization
of deferred policy and pre-need acquisition costs and value of business acquired increased by 1,807,000, or 11.2 , to 17,950,000 for
2022, from 16,143,000 for 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of deferred policy
and pre-need acquisition costs. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased by 66,590,000, or 22.3 , to 231,848,000 for 2022, from 298,438,000 for 2021. This decrease
was primarily the result of a 54,965,000 decrease in commissions, a 7,268,000 decrease in other expenses, a 3,002,000 decrease in
costs related to funding mortgage loans, a 928,000 decrease in advertising expenses, a 629,000 decrease in personnel expenses, and
a 359,000 decrease in rent and rent related expenses. This decrease was partially offset by a 561,000 increase in depreciation on property
and equipment. 

Interest
expense increased by 703,000, or 9.9 , to 7,830,000 for 2022, from 7,127,000 for 2021. This increase was primarily due to a 1,587,000
increase in interest expense on bank loans, which was partially offset by a decrease of 884,000 in interest expense on mortgage warehouse
lines for loans held for sale. 

27 

Cost
of goods and services sold of the cemeteries and mortuaries increased by 1,017,000, or 27.5 , to 4,721,000 for 2022, from 3,704,000
for 2021. This increase was primarily due to a 1,196,000 increase in mortuary at-need sales and a 77,000 increase in cemetery at-need
sales, which was partially offset by a 256,000 decrease in cemetery pre-need sales. 

Income
tax expense decreased by 3,595,000, or 29.3 , to 8,687,000 for 2022, from 12,282,000 for 2021. This decrease was primarily due to
a decrease in earnings before income taxes for 2022 compared to 2021. 

Risks 

The
following is a description of the material risks facing the Company and how it mitigates those risks: 

Legal
and Regulatory Risks . Changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the Company operates may create additional expenses
and risks not anticipated by the Company in developing and pricing its products. Regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits,
new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those
recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other
public policy or legislative changes may affect the Company s mortgage sales. Also, the Company may be subject to further regulations
in the cemetery and mortuary business. The Company aims to mitigate these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying
its operations, thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction, and also by employing underwriting practices that identify
and minimize the adverse impact of such risks. 

Mortgage
Industry Risks . Developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets can adversely affect the Company s ability to sell
its mortgage loans to investors, which can impact the Company s financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding
and servicing any unsold loans. 

The
mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the Company could realize in the future on
mortgage loans sold to third-party investors. The Company s mortgage subsidiary may be required to reimburse third-party investors
for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default
in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or, in lieu of repurchase, to pay a negotiated fee to the investors. The Company s
estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities. 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company increased its loan loss reserve by 1,079,000 and 2,211,000, respectively,
for loan originations, and the charges have been included in mortgage fee income. The estimated liability for indemnification losses
is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances were 1,726,000 and 2,447,000,
respectively. The Company believes the loan loss reserve represents probable loan losses incurred as of December 31, 2022. There is a
risk, however, that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserve. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company s mortgage loans held for investment portfolio consisted of mortgage loans in an aggregate principal
amount of 2,567,000 with delinquencies exceeding 90 days. Of this amount, loans with an aggregate principal amount of 1,281,000 were
in foreclosure proceedings. The Company has not received or recognized any interest income on the 2,567,000 in mortgage loans with delinquencies
exceeding 90 days. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company increased its allowance for loan losses by
 270,000 and by 305,000, respectively, which was charged to bad debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses
for the period. The allowances for loan losses on the Company s held for investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021
were 1,970,000 and 1,700,000, respectively. 

Interest
Rate Risk . Fluctuations in interest rates may cause a decrease in the value of the Company s investments or impair the ability
of the Company to market its mortgage and cemetery and mortuary products. This change in rates may cause certain interest-sensitive products
to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation. The Company aims to mitigate this risk by charging fees for non-conformance with
certain policy provisions, by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser, and by attempting to match the maturity schedule
of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature,
the Company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale. 

28 

Mortality
and Morbidity Risks . The Company s actuarial assumptions differing from actual mortality and morbidity experienced may mean
that the Company s relevant products sold were underpriced, may require the Company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier
than planned, and have other potentially adverse consequences to the business. The Company aims to minimize this risk through sound underwriting
practices, asset and liability duration matching, and sound actuarial practices. 

COVID-19 .
Like most businesses, COVID-19 has impacted the Company, including the temporary adoption of work-from-home arrangements for employees
and a restructuring of selling techniques for its products and services. Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Company continued to adapt to
the impact of COVID-19 and its related economic effects. The Company experienced, like all life insurance companies, higher than expected
death rates during the pandemic. Death rates in 2022 declined over 2021 and 2020, but remain higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. 

Banking
Environment . Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

Silicon
Valley Bank was placed in receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). On March 12, 2023, the
FDIC announced that depositors of Silicon Valley Bank will have access to all of their funds starting Monday, March 13, 2023. On March
12, 2023, Signature Bank was placed in receivership with the FDIC. On March 12, 2023, the FDIC announced that banking activities will
resume on Monday, March 13, 2023. 

The
Company does not maintain any deposit or other accounts or credit facilities with Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, or their successors.
The Company holds one bond with a par value of 250,000 in the Company s debt portfolio and is junior in priority to a debt investment
of Silicon Valley Bank or its successors. The Company continues to monitor the banking industry. 

The
information furnished in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. 

Estimates .
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term are those used in determining the value of derivative
assets and liabilities; those used in determining deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired; those used in determining
the value of mortgage loans foreclosed to real estate held for investment; those used in determining the liability for future policy
benefits and unearned revenue; those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre-need sales; those used in determining the
value of mortgage servicing rights; those used in determining allowances for loan losses for mortgage loans held for investment; those
used in determining loan loss reserve; and those used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although some variability is
inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are fairly stated in all material respects. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums, contract payments
and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business, from interest and dividends on invested assets, and from
the proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. The mortgage subsidiaries realize cash flow from fees generated by originating
and refinancing mortgage loans and fees on mortgage loans held for sale that are sold to investors into the secondary market. It should
be noted that current conditions in the financial markets and economy caused by COVID-19 may affect the realization of these expected
cash flows. The Company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities,
which generally are long-term, and adequate to pay current policyholder claims, annuity payments, expenses related to the issuance of
new policies, the maintenance of existing policies, debt service, and to meet current operating expenses. 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s operations provided cash of 130,450,000 and of 144,638,000,
respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operations was due primarily to decreased proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale. 

29 

The
Company s liability for future policy benefits is expected to be paid out over the long-term due to the Company s market
niche of selling funeral plans. Funeral plans are small face value life insurance policies that payout upon a person s death to
cover funeral burial costs. Policyholders generally keep these policies in force and do not surrender them prior to death. Because of
the long-term nature of these liabilities, the Company is able to hold to maturity its bonds, real estate, and mortgage loans thus reducing
the risk of liquidating these long-term investments as a result of any sudden changes in their fair values. 

The
Company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities. The Company may
sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing matching. The Company purchases short-term
investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short-term requirements of the Company s products. The Company s
investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return, which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery
and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements. 

The
Company s investment policy is also to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities, real estate, mortgage loans, and warehousing
of mortgage loans held for sale on a short-term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws
governing the life insurance subsidiaries. Bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to 345,598,000 (at estimated fair value)
and 259,005,000 (at estimated fair value) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This represented 36.4 and 31.5 of the total
investments as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Generally, all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated
by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under this rating system, there are six categories used for rating bonds. At
December 31, 2022, 2.2 (or 7,833,000) and at December 31, 2021, 3.9 (or 9,991,000) of the Company s total bond investments
were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six, which are considered non-investment grade. 

See
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities available for
sale and for the schedule of principal payments for mortgage loans held for investment. 

See
Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company s sources of liquidity. 

If
market conditions were to cause interest rates to change, the fair value of the Company s fixed income portfolio (of approximately
 653,982,000), which includes bonds, preferred stocks and mortgage loans held for investment, could change by the following amounts based
on the respective basis point swing (the change in the fair values were calculated using a modeling technique): 

-200

 (63,748 

The
Company is subject to risk-based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the
perceived risk of assets, liabilities, disintermediation, and business risk. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the life insurance subsidiaries
were in compliance with the regulatory criteria. 

The
Company s total capitalization of stockholders equity, and bank loans and other loans payable was 454,499,000 as of December
31, 2022, as compared to 551,054,000 as of December 31, 2021. Stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was 64.4 
and 54.4 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Bank loans and other loans payable decreased by 89,574,000 for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, and stockholders equity decreased by 6,981,000 for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, thus causing the increase in the stockholders equity
percentage. 

Lapse
rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period. The Company s lapse rate for life insurance was 4.3 
in 2022 as compared to a rate of 4.8 for 2021. 

30 

The
combined statutory capital and surplus of the Company s life insurance subsidiaries was 94,254,000 and 82,823,000 as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to their parent company without the approval of
state insurance regulatory authorities. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

The
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information about their businesses without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking
and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected in such statements. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, together with related data and projections, about the Company s
projected financial results and its future plans and strategies. However, actual results and needs of the Company may vary materially
from forward-looking statements and projections made from time to time by the Company on the basis of management s then-current
expectations. The business in which the Company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets, which may involve a high degree
of risk, and there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements and projections will prove accurate. 

Factors
that may cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated or projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted
in such forward looking statements include among others, the following possibilities: (i) heightened competition, including the intensification
of price competition, the entry of new competitors, and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors; (ii) adverse
state and federal legislation or regulation, including decreases in rates, limitations on premium levels, increases in minimum capital
and reserve requirements, benefit mandates and tax treatment of insurance products; (iii) fluctuations in interest rates causing a reduction
of investment income or increase in interest expense and in the market value of interest rate sensitive investment; (iv) failure to obtain
new customers, retain existing customers or reductions in policies in force by existing customers; (v) higher service, administrative,
or general expenses due to the need for additional advertising, marketing, administrative or management information systems expenditures;
(vi) loss or retirement of key executives or employees; (vii) increases in medical costs; (viii) changes in the Company s liquidity
due to changes in asset and liability matching; (ix) restrictions on insurance underwriting based on genetic testing and other criteria;
(x) adverse changes in the ratings obtained by independent rating agencies; (xi) failure to maintain adequate reinsurance; (xii) possible
claims relating to sales practices for insurance products and claim denials; (xiii) adverse trends in mortality and morbidity; (xiv)
deterioration of real estate markets; and (xv) lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Agreements 

The
Company has entered into commitments to fund construction and land development loans and has also provided financing for land acquisition
and development. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s commitments were approximately 231,250,000 for these loans, of which 175,754,000
had been funded. The Company advances funds once the work has been completed and an inspection is made. The maximum loan commitment ranges
between 50 and 80 of appraised value. The Company receives fees and interest for these loans and the interest rate is generally fixed
5.25 to 8.50 per annum. Maturities generally range between six and eighteen months. 

Contractual
Obligations 

In
the ordinary course of the Company s operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include
operating leases for office space, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and future policy benefits. See Notes 7, 22, 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these obligations. 

Casualty
Insurance Program 

In
conjunction with the Company s casualty insurance program, limited equity interests are held in a captive insurance entity. This
program permits the Company to self-insure a portion of losses, to gain access to a wide array of safety-related services, to pool insurance
risks and resources in order to obtain more competitive pricing for administration and reinsurance and to limit its risk of loss in any
particular year. The maximum exposure to loss related to the Company s involvement with this entity is limited to approximately
 443,758, which is collateralized under a standby letter of credit issued on the insurance entity s behalf. See Note 10, Reinsurance,
Commitments and Contingencies, for additional discussion of commitments associated with the insurance program. The Company does
not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit because claims are not expected to exceed
premiums paid.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Security National Financial Corporation: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Security National Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Future
Policy Benefits and Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs for Insurance Contracts and Value of Business Acquired - Refer
to Notes 1 and 22 to the financial statements 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

The
Company s management sets assumptions in (1) estimating a liability for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future
(future policy benefits) and (2) determining amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for insurance contracts and value of business
acquired. The most significant assumptions include mortality, lapse, and projected investment yield. Assumptions are determined based
upon analysis of Company specific experience, industry standards, adjusted for changes in exposure and other relevant factors. Given
the inherent uncertainty of these significant assumptions, auditing the development of such assumptions involved especially subjective
judgment. 

33 

How
the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
audit procedures related to management s judgments regarding the assumptions used in the development of future policy benefits
and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for insurance contracts and value of business acquired, included the following,
among others: 

We tested the design and implementation of controls over the assumption development process, the valuation of future policy benefits,
and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for insurance contracts and value of business acquired. 

With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we: 

evaluated
 management s selected actuarial assumptions, including testing the accuracy and completeness of the supporting experience studies, 

evaluated
 management s judgments regarding the assumptions used in the development of future policy benefits and the amortization of
 deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired, 

evaluated
 the results of the Company s annual premium deficiency tests.

 Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Mortgage
loans held for investment are carried at their unpaid principal balances adjusted for net deferred fees, net discounts, charge-offs
and the related allowance for loan losses. Interest income is included in net investment income on the consolidated statements of earnings
and is recognized when earned. The Company defers related loan origination fees, net of related direct loan origination costs, and amortizes
the net fees over the term of the loans. Origination fees are included in net investment income on the consolidated statements of earnings.
Mortgage loans are secured by the underlying property and require an appraisal at the time of underwriting and funding. Generally, the
Company will fund a loan not to exceed 80 of the loan s collateral fair market value. Amounts over 80 will require additional
collateral or mortgage insurance by an approved third-party insurer. 

Real
estate held for investment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the properties, or is adjusted to a new basis for impairment in value, if any. Included are foreclosed properties which
the Company intends to hold for investment purposes. These properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon foreclosure.
Also, included are residential subdivision land developments which are carried at cost. 

Real
estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost or fair value. Depreciation is not recognized on real estate classified as held
for sale. 

Other
investments and policy loans are carried at the aggregate unpaid balances, less allowances for losses. 

Accrued
investment income refers to earned income from investments that has not yet been received by the Company. 

Gains
and losses on investments (except for equity securities carried at fair value through net earnings) arise when investments are sold
(as determined on a specific identification basis) or are other than temporarily impaired. If in management s judgment a decline
in the value of an investment below cost is other than temporary, the cost of the investment is written down to fair value with a corresponding
charge to earnings. Factors considered in judging whether an impairment is other than temporary include: the financial condition, business
prospects and credit worthiness of the issuer, the length of time that fair value has been less than cost, the relative amount of the
decline, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers, which is not assured.

The
appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds support to the Company s determination of fair value
because if the loan becomes delinquent, the Company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value
of the loan, thus minimizing credit losses. 

The
majority of loans originated are sold to third-party investors. The amounts expected to be sold to investors are shown on the consolidated
balance sheets as loans held for sale.

annually on the remaining outstanding principal balances of the loans. Based on the result of the cash flow analysis, an asset or liability
is recorded for mortgage servicing rights. The servicing fees are collected from the monthly payments made by the mortgagors. The Company
generally receives other remuneration including rights to various mortgagor-contracted fees such as late charges, and collateral reconveyance
charges and the Company is generally entitled to retain the interest earned on funds held pending remittance of mortgagor principal,
interest, tax and insurance payments. Contractual servicing fees and late fees are included in other revenues on the consolidated statements
of earnings. 

The
Company s subsequent accounting for MSRs is based on the class of MSRs. The Company has identified two classes of MSRs: MSRs backed
by mortgage loans with initial term of years and MSRs backed by mortgage loans with initial term of years. The Company distinguishes
between these classes of MSRs due to their differing sensitivities to change in value as the result of changes in market. After being
initially recorded at fair value, MSRs backed by mortgage loans are accounted for using the amortization method. Amortization expense
is included in other expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. MSR amortization is determined by amortizing the MSR balance
in proportion to, and over the period of the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. 

Interest
rate risk, prepayment risk, and default risk are inherent risks in MSR valuation. Interest rate changes largely drive prepayment rates.
Refinance activity generally increases as rates decline. A significant decrease in rates beyond expectation could cause a decline in
the value of the MSR. On the contrary, if rates increase borrowers are less likely to refinance or prepay their mortgage, which extends
the duration of the loan and MSR values are likely to rise. Because of these risks, discount rates and prepayment speeds are used to
estimate the fair value. 

The
Company periodically assesses MSRs for impairment. Impairment occurs when the current fair value of the MSR falls below the asset s
carrying value (carrying value is the amortized cost reduced by any related valuation allowance). If MSRs are impaired, the impairment
is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the MSRs is adjusted through a valuation allowance.

Management
periodically reviews the various loan strata to determine whether the value of the MSRs in a given stratum is impaired and likely to
recover. When management deems recovery of the value to be unlikely in the foreseeable future, a write-down of the cost of the MSRs for
that stratum to its estimated recoverable value is charged to the valuation allowance.

lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms.

Forward
Sale Commitments 

The
Company utilizes forward commitments to economically hedge the price risk associated with its outstanding mortgage loan commitments.
A forward commitment protects the Company from losses on sales of the loans arising from exercise of the loan commitments. Management
expects these types of commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to changes in fair value of the loan commitments, thereby
reducing earnings volatility related to the recognition in earnings of changes in the values of the commitments. 

The
net changes in fair value of loan commitments and forward sale commitments are shown in current earnings as a component of mortgage fee
income on the consolidated statements of earnings. Mortgage banking derivatives are shown in other assets and other liabilities and accrued
expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Call
and Put Option Derivatives 

The
Company uses a strategy of selling out of the money call options on its equity securities as a source of revenue. The options
give the purchaser the right to buy from the Company specified equity securities at a set price up to a pre-determined date in the future.
The Company uses the strategy of selling put options as a means of generating cash or purchasing equity securities at lower than current
market prices. The Company receives an immediate payment of cash for the value of the option and establishes a liability for the fair
value of the option. The liability for options is adjusted to fair value at each reporting date. In the event a call option is exercised,
the Company sells the equity security at a favorable price enhanced by the value of the option that was sold. If the option expires unexercised,
the Company recognizes a gain from the expired option. In the event a put option is exercised, the Company acquires an equity security
at the strike price of the option reduced by the value received from the sale of the put option. The equity security is then treated
as a normal equity security in the Company s portfolio. The net changes in the fair value of call and put options are shown in
current earnings as a component of gains (losses) on investments and other assets. Call and put options are shown in other liabilities
and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.

The
allowance for losses on mortgage loans held for investment could change based on changes in the value of the underlying collateral, the
performance status of the loans, or the Company s actual collection experience. The actual losses could change, in the near term,
from the established allowance, based upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of these events. 

For
purposes of determining the allowance for losses, the Company has segmented its mortgage loans held for investment by loan type. The
Company s loan types are commercial, residential, and residential construction. The inherent risks within the portfolio vary depending
upon the loan type as follows: 

Commercial
 Underwritten in accordance with the Company s policies to determine the borrower s ability to repay the obligation
as agreed. Commercial loans are made primarily based on the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Accordingly, the repayment of
a commercial loan depends primarily on the collateral and its ability to generate income and secondary on the borrower s (or guarantors)
ability to repay. 

Residential
 Secured by family dwelling units. These loans are secured by first and second mortgages on the unit. The borrower s
ability to repay is sensitive to the life events and general economic condition of the region. Where loan to values exceed 80 , the loan
is generally guaranteed by private mortgage insurance, FHA or VA. 

Residential
construction (including land acquisition and development) Underwritten in accordance with the Company s underwriting
policies which include a financial analysis of the builders, borrowers (guarantors), construction cost estimates, and independent appraisal
valuations. These loans will rely on the value associated with the project upon completion. These cost and valuation estimates may be
inaccurate. Construction loans generally involve the disbursement of substantial funds over a short period of time with repayment substantially
dependent upon the success of the completed project and the ability of the borrower to secure long-term financing. Additionally, land
is underwritten according to the Company s policies, which include independent appraisal valuations as well as the estimated value
associated with the land upon completion of development into finished lots. These cost and valuation estimates may be inaccurate. These
loans are considered to be of a higher risk than other mortgage loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to general economic
conditions, availability of long-term or construction financing, and interest rate sensitivity. 

to . Benefit reserves for traditional
limited-payment life insurance policies include the deferred portion of the premiums received during the premium-paying period. Deferred
premiums are recognized as income over the life of the policies. Policy benefit claims are charged to expense in the period the claims
are incurred. Increases in future policy benefits are charged to expense. 

Future
policy benefit reserves for interest-sensitive insurance products are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy
account balances before applicable surrender charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred
in the period in excess of related policy account balances. Interest crediting rates for interest-sensitive insurance products ranged
from to .

The
Company records an unpaid claims liability for claims in the course of settlement equal to the death benefit amount less any reinsurance

The
Company entered into coinsurance agreements with unaffiliated insurance companies under which the Company assumed of the risk for
certain life insurance policies and certain other policy-related liabilities of the insurance company. 

Reinsurance
premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, and reserves related to reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with
those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Expense allowances received in
connection with reinsurance ceded are accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs and are deferred and amortized
accordingly.

Pre-need
contract sales of cemetery services (primarily merchandise delivery, installation fees and burial opening and closing fees) - revenue
and costs associated with the sales of pre-need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed. 

Prearranged
funeral and pre-need cemetery customer acquisition costs - costs incurred related to obtaining new pre-need contract cemetery and
prearranged funeral services, which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre-need cemetery
and prearranged funeral services, are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed. 

Revenues
and costs for at-need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists, the services are performed, collection is reasonably assured and
there are no significant performance obligations remaining. 

The
Company, through its cemetery and mortuary operations, provides guaranteed funeral arrangements wherein a prospective customer can receive
future goods and services at guaranteed prices. To accomplish this, the Company, through its life insurance operations, sells to the
customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries. If, at the time of need, the policyholder/potential
mortuary customer utilizes one of the Company s facilities, the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned
will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price. The increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between
the original contract prices and current prices. Risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy.
However, management believes that given current inflation rates and related price increases of goods and services, the risk of exposure
is minimal.

ASU
No. 2018-12: Financial Services Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 
 Issued in August 2018, ASU 2018-12 is intended to improve the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future
policy benefits on traditional long-duration contracts by requiring that assumptions be updated after contract inception and by modifying
the rate used to discount future cash flows. The ASU will improve the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated
with deposit or account balance contracts, simplify amortization of deferred acquisition costs while improving and expanding required
disclosures. In November 2020, the FASB issued an update to ASU No. 2018-12 that made the ASU effective for the Company on January 1,
2025. The Company has made progress in the implementation of the new standard, including the involvement of actuaries, accountants, and
systems specialists. However, the Company has not yet estimated the impact the new guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

The

On
a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. This evaluation includes a review
of current ratings by the National Association of Insurance Commissions NAIC ). Securities with a rating of 1 or 2 are
considered investment grade and are not reviewed for impairment, unless current market or recent company news could lead to a credit
downgrade. Securities with ratings of 3 to 5 are evaluated for impairment. Securities with a rating of 6 are automatically determined
to be impaired and are written down. The evaluation involves an analysis of the securities in relation to historical values, interest
payment history, projected earnings and revenue growth rates as well as a review of the reason for a downgrade in the NAIC rating. Based
on the analysis of a security that is rated 3 to 5, a determination is made whether the security will likely make interest and principal
payments in accordance with the terms of the financial instrument. If it is unlikely that the security will meet contractual obligations,
the loss is considered to be other than temporary, the security is written down to the new anticipated market value and an impairment
loss is recognized. 

The
fair values of fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, when available. For fixed maturity securities not actively
traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services, or in the case of private placements, are
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market value applicable to the coupon rate, credit and maturity of
the investments.

Mortgage
Loans Held for Investment 

The
Company reports mortgage loans held for investment pursuant to the accounting policy discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. 

Mortgage
loans consist of first and second mortgages. The mortgage loans bear interest at rates ranging from to , maturity dates range
from to years and are secured by real estate. Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of mortgage loan debtors
have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes
in economic conditions. Although the Company has a diversified mortgage loan portfolio consisting of residential mortgages, commercial
loans and residential construction loans and requires collateral on all real estate exposures, a substantial portion of its debtors 
ability to honor obligations is reliant on the economic stability of the geographic region in which the debtors do business. At December

Once
a loan is past due 90 days, it is the policy of the Company to end the accrual of interest income on the loan and write off any income
that had been accrued. Payments received for loans on a non-accrual status are recognized on a cash basis. Interest income recognized
from any payments received for loans on a non-accrual status was immaterial. Accrual of interest resumes if a loan is brought current.
Interest not accrued on these loans totals approximately and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

When
a repurchase demand corresponding to a mortgage loan previously held for sale and sold to a third-party investor is received from a third-party
investor, the relevant data is reviewed and captured so that an estimated future loss can be calculated. The key factors that are used
in the estimated loss calculation are as follows: (i) lien position, (ii) payment status, (iii) claim type, (iv) unpaid principal balance,
(v) interest rate, and (vi) validity of the demand. Other data is captured and is useful for management purposes; the actual estimated
loss is generally based on these key factors. The Company conducts its own review upon the receipt of a repurchase demand. In many instances,
the Company is able to resolve the issues relating to the repurchase demand by the third-party investor without having to make any payments
to the investor.

in reserves were added at a rate of 3.19 basis points per loan, the equivalent of 
per

and Lehman Holdings. The full amount of SecurityNational Mortgage s settlement payment was accounted for in the
Company s loan loss reserve as of December 31, 2020 and was paid during the first quarter 2021. The unique nature of

economic conditions in order to maintain adequate loss reserves on current production. Thus, the Company believes that the final
loan loss reserve as of December 31, 2022, represents its best estimate for adequate loss reserves on loans sold.

Company evaluates the financial condition of reinsurers and monitors the concentration of credit risk. The Company had a significant
concentration of credit risk with a single reinsurer of and of ceded life insurance in force as of December 31, 2022 and

Mortgage
Loan Loss Settlements 

Future
loan losses can be extremely difficult to estimate. However, the Company believes that its reserve methodology and its current practice
of property preservation allow it to estimate potential losses on loans sold. The estimated liability for indemnification losses is included
in other liabilities and accrued expenses and, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances were and , respectively.
The Company believes that the loan loss reserve as of December 31, 2022, represents its best estimate for adequate loss reserves on loans
sold.

The
Company leases office space and equipment under various non-cancelable agreements. See Note 24 regarding leases. 

Other
Contingencies and Commitments 

The
Company has entered into commitments to fund construction and land development loans and has also provided financing for land acquisition
and development. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s commitments were approximately , for these loans of which 
had been funded. The Company advances funds once the work has been completed and an independent inspection is made. The maximum loan
commitment ranges between and of appraised value. The Company receives fees and interest for these loans and the interest rate
is generally fixed to per annum. Maturities range between six and eighteen months. 

The
Company belongs to a captive insurance group for certain casualty insurance, worker compensation and liability programs. Insurance reserves
are maintained relative to these programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and
aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the insurance liabilities and related reserves, the captive insurance management
considers a number of factors, which include historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided
by independent third-party actuaries. If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates, additional
reserves may be required. The estimation process contains uncertainty since captive insurance management must use judgment to estimate
the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of
the balance sheet date. 

The
Company is a defendant in various other legal actions arising from the normal conduct of business. Management believes that none of the
actions will have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. Based on management s assessment
and legal counsel s representations concerning the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes, no amounts have been accrued for the above
claims in the consolidated financial statements.

the expected life of the options is based upon the Federal Reserve Board s daily interest rates in effect at the time of the grant.

The
Utah, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas Insurance Departments impose minimum risk-based capital RBC requirements that
were developed by the NAIC on insurance enterprises. The formulas for determining the RBC specify various factors that are applied to
financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio
(the Ratio) of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its authorized control level, as
defined by the NAIC. Enterprises below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires
specified corrective action. The life insurance subsidiaries each have a ratio that is greater than the first level of regulatory action
as of December 31, 2022. The Company does not have any guarantees to maintain the capital and surplus of any affiliates except for the Company s
agreement to provide additional capital to Security National Life Insurance Company in the event risk-based capital drops below 350 of
the authorized control level. 

Generally,
the net assets of the life insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to the Company are limited to the amounts of the life insurance
subsidiaries net assets, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, that exceed minimum statutory capital requirements.
Additional requirements must be met depending on the state, and payments of such amounts as dividends are subject to approval by regulatory
authorities.

 Statutory Financial Information and Dividend Limitations (Continued) 

Under
the Utah Insurance Code, Security National Life Insurance Company is permitted to pay stockholder dividends, or otherwise make distributions,
to the Company subject to certain limitations. Security National Life Insurance Company must ensure that its surplus held for policyholders
is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs after payment of any such dividend or distribution.
Furthermore, where any dividend or distribution, together with all other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months,
exceeds the lesser of (i) 10 of its surplus held for policyholders as of the next preceding December 31; or (ii) its net gain from operations,
not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the next preceding December 31, such dividend or distribution constitutes
 extraordinary under Utah law and Security National Life Insurance Company would be required to file notice of its intention
to declare such a dividend or make such a distribution with the Utah Commissioner and the Utah Commissioner must either approve the distribution
or dividend or not disapprove the dividend or distribution within 30 days of the notice filing. Based on Security National Life
Insurance Company s surplus held for policyholders and net gain from operations as of December 31, 2022, the maximum aggregate
amount of dividends and distributions that it could pay or make in 2023 and which would not constitute an extraordinary 
dividend or distribution under Utah law, and would therefore not require notice and approval or lack of disproval from the Utah Commissioner,
would be approximately . 

Under
the Louisiana Insurance Code, First Guaranty Insurance Company and Kilpatrick Life Insurance Company are permitted to pay stockholder
dividends, or otherwise make distributions, to the Company subject to certain limitations. First Guaranty Insurance Company and Kilpatrick
Life Insurance Company must ensure that its surplus held for policyholders is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and
adequate to its financial needs after payment of any such dividend or distribution. Furthermore, where any dividend or distribution,
together with all other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10 of its surplus
held for policyholders as of the next preceding December 31; or (ii) its net gain from operations, not including realized capital gains,
for the 12-month period ending the next preceding December 31, such dividend or distribution constitutes extraordinary 
under Louisiana law and First Guaranty Insurance Company and Kilpatrick Life Insurance Company would be required to file notice of its
intention to declare such a dividend or make such a distribution with the Louisiana Commissioner and the Louisiana Commissioner must
either approve the distribution or dividend or not disapprove the dividend or distribution within 30 days of the notice filing.
Based on First Guaranty Insurance Company s and Kilpatrick Life Insurance Company s surplus held for policyholders and net
gain from operations as of December 31, 2022, the maximum aggregate amount of dividends and distributions that it could pay or make in
2023 and which would not constitute an extraordinary dividend or distribution under Louisiana law, and would therefore
not require notice and approval or lack of disproval from the Louisiana Commissioner, would be approximately for First Guaranty

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Restricted
Assets : A portion of these assets include mutual funds, equity securities and fixed maturity securities available for sale that
have quoted market prices that are used to determine fair value. Also included are cash and cash equivalents and participations in mortgage
loans. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their
fair values due to their short-term nature. 

Cemetery
Perpetual Care Trust Investments : A portion of these assets include equity securities and fixed maturity securities available
for sale that have quoted market prices that are used to determine fair value. Also included are cash and cash equivalents. The carrying
amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to
their short-term nature 

Call
and Put Options : The Company uses quoted market prices to value its call and put options. 

Additionally,
there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The
items shown under Level 3 are valued as follows: 

Loans
Held for Sale : The Company elected the fair value option for loans held for sale. The fair value is based on quoted market prices,
when available. When a quoted market price is not readily available, the Company uses the market price from its last sale of similar
assets. 

Loan
Commitments and Forward Sale Commitments : The Company s mortgage segment enters into loan commitments with potential borrowers
and forward sale commitments to sell loans to third-party investors. The Company also uses a hedging strategy for these transactions.
A loan commitment binds the Company to lend funds to a qualified borrower at a specified interest rate and within a specified period
of time, generally up to 30 days after issuance of the loan commitment. Loan commitments are defined to be derivatives under GAAP and
are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in their fair values recorded in current earnings. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of a loan commitment based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, quoted
MBS prices, estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and an estimate of the probability that the mortgage loan will
fund within the terms of the commitment. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the loan
commitment is issued. Following issuance, the value of a mortgage loan commitment can be either positive or negative depending upon the
change in value of the underlying mortgage loans. Fallout rates and other factors from the Company s recent historical data are
used to estimate the quantity and value of mortgage loans that will fund within the terms of the commitments. 

Impaired
Mortgage Loans Held for Investment : The Company believes that the fair value of these nonperforming loans will approximate the
unpaid principal balance expected to be recovered based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. For residential and commercial
properties, the collateral value is estimated by obtaining an independent appraisal. The appraisal typically considers area comparables
and property condition as well as potential rental income that could be generated (particularly for commercial properties). For residential
construction loans, the collateral is typically incomplete, so fair value is estimated as the replacement cost using data from a provider
of building cost information to the real estate construction. 

Impaired
Real Estate Held for Investment : The Company believes that in an orderly market, fair value will approximate the replacement
cost of a home and the rental income provides a cash flow stream for investment analysis. The Company believes the highest and best use
of the properties are as income producing assets since it is the Company s intent to hold the properties as rental properties,
matching the income from the investment in rental properties with the funds required for future estimated policy claims.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

It
should be noted that for replacement cost, when determining the fair value of real estate held for investment, the Company uses a provider
of building cost information to the real estate construction industry. For the investment analysis, the Company used market data based
upon its real estate operation experience and projected the present value of the net rental income over seven years. The Company also
considers area comparable properties and property condition when determining fair value. 

In
addition to this analysis performed by the Company, the Company depreciates Real Estate Held for Investment. This depreciation reduces
the book value of these properties and lessens the exposure to the Company from further deterioration in real estate values. 

Mortgage
Servicing Rights : The Company initially recognizes MSRs at their estimated fair values derived from the net cash flows associated
with the servicing contracts, where the Company assumes the obligation to service the loan in the sale transaction.

The
methods, assumptions and significant valuation techniques and inputs used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized
as follows: 

Mortgage
Loans Held for Investment : The estimated fair value of the Company s mortgage loans held for investment is determined using
various methods. The Company s mortgage loans are grouped into three categories: Residential, Residential Construction and Commercial.
When estimating the expected future cash flows, it is assumed that all loans will be held to maturity, and any loans that are non-performing
are evaluated individually for impairment. 

Residential
 The estimated fair value of mortgage loans is determined through a combination of discounted cash flows (estimating expected
future cash flows of payments and discounting them using current interest rates from single family mortgages) and considering pricing
of similar loans that were sold recently. 

Residential
Construction These loans are primarily short in maturity. Accordingly, the estimated fair value is determined to be the carrying
value. 

Commercial
 The estimated fair value is determined by estimating expected future cash flows of payments and discounting them using current
interest rates for commercial mortgages.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Bank
and Other Loans Payable : The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for these financial instruments
approximate their fair values due to their relatively short-term maturities and variable interest rates. 

Policyholder
Account Balances and Future Policy Benefits-Annuities : Future policy benefit reserves for interest-sensitive insurance products
are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. Policy benefits
and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances. Interest
crediting rates for interest-sensitive insurance products ranged from 1.5 to 6.5 . The fair values for these investment-type insurance
contracts are estimated based on the present value of liability cash flows. The fair values for the Company s insurance contracts
other than investment-type contracts are not required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts
are taken into consideration in the Company s overall management of interest rate risk, such that the Company s exposure
to changing interest rates is minimized through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

The
Company s three types of future obligations are as follows: 

Pre-need
Merchandise and Service Revenue : All pre-need merchandise and service revenue is deferred and the funds are placed in trust until
the need arises, the merchandise is received or the service is performed. The trust is then relieved, and the revenue and commissions
are recognized. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances were and , respectively. 

At-need
Specialty Merchandise Revenue : At-need specialty merchandise revenue consists of customizable merchandise ordered from a manufacturer
such as markers and bases. When specialty merchandise is ordered, it can take time to manufacture and deliver the product. Revenue is
deferred until the at-need merchandise is received. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances were and , respectively.
Deferred revenue for at-need specialty revenue is not placed in trust. 

Deferred
Pre-need Land Revenue : Deferred pre-need revenue and corresponding commissions are deferred until of the funds are received
from the customer through regular monthly payments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances were nil and nil , respectively. Deferred
pre-need land revenue is not placed in trust. 

Complete
payment of the contract does not constitute fulfillment of the performance obligation. Goods or services are deferred until such time
the service is performed or merchandise is received. Pre-need contracts are required to be paid in full prior to a customer using a good
or service from a pre-need contract. Goods and services from pre-need contracts can be transferred when paid in full from one owner to
another. In such cases, the Company will act as an agent in transferring the requested goods and services. A transfer of goods and services
does not fulfill an obligation and revenue remains deferred.

Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

The
Company s cemetery and mortuary segment recognizes revenue on future performance obligations when goods are delivered and when
services are performed and is not determined by the terms or payments of the contract as long as any good or service is paid in full
prior to delivery. Prices are determined based on the market at the time a contract is created. Goods or services are not partially completed.
There are no significant judgements, estimations or allocation methods when revenue should be recognized. 

Practical
Expedients 

The
Company has not elected to use any of the practical expedients under ASC 606. 

Contract
Costs 

The
Company s cemetery and mortuary segment defers certain costs associated with obtaining a contract on future obligations. 

Pre-need
Merchandise and Service Revenue : Pre-need merchandise and service revenues are deferred until the goods or services are delivered.
Recognition can be years until the obligations are satisfied. Commissions and other costs are capitalized and deferred until the obligation
is satisfied. Other costs include rent on pre-need offices and training rooms, and call center costs. Costs that are allocated based
on a percentage include family service advisor compensation, bonuses, utilities and supplies that are all used to procure a pre-need
sale. 

At-need
Specialty Merchandise Revenue : At-need specialty merchandise is ordered from a third-party manufacturer. Generally, at-need specialty
merchandise is ordered and received within 90 days of order. These orders are also short-term in nature and are deferred until the product
is received from the manufacturer and the obligation is satisfied.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

(a)
Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control
over financial reporting is a process that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ),
and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets
 of the Company, 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors
 of the Company, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
 of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022
based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether the Company s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Based on that assessment management believes that at December 31, 2022, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting was effective. 

This
annual report on internal control over financial reporting does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the
Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company
to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 

There
was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter 2022 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

4.
The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures

within those entities, particularly during the period covered in which this report is being prepared; 

(b)
Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

5.
The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons

reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

(b)
Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
