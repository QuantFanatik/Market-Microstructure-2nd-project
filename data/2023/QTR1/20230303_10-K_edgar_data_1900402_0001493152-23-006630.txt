SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, or the
Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The statements contained in this report
that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding our or our management s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any
statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying
assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipates, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, 
 potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions
may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements in this report may include, for example, statements about our: 

ability
 to complete our initial business combination; 

success
 in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

officers
 and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving
 our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; 

potential
 ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

pool
 of prospective target businesses; 

the
 ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities; 

potential
 change in control if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock; 

the
 potential liquidity and trading of our securities; 

the
 lack of a market for our securities; 

use
 of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; or 

financial
 performance. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors. 
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable
securities laws and/or if and when management knows or has a reasonable basis on which to conclude that previously disclosed projections
are no longer reasonably attainable.

I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

EVGR
was incorporated as a blank check company on October 21, 2021, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, for the purpose of entering into
a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one
or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a target business. 

EVGR s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that its corporate existence will cease and it will liquidate the
trust account (described herein) and distribute the funds included therein to the holders of ordinary shares sold in its IPO if it does
not consummate a business combination by July 20, 2023. 

Offering
Proceeds Held in Trust 

On
February 11, 2022, EVGR consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing
of the IPO, EVGR consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 480,000 units to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per private
placement unit, generating gross proceeds to EVGR in the amount of 4,800,000. 

On
February 11, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional 1,500,000 units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment
option. The over-allotment option units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to EVGR
of 15,000,000. Also, in connection with the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 52,500 private
placement units at a purchase price of 10.00 per unit. 

Following
the closing of the IPO on February 11, 2022, an amount of 116,725,000 10.15 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units
in the IPO and the private placement was placed in a trust account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning
set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity
of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by EVGR meeting the
conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by EVGR, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business
Combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account. As of the date of this proxy statement, funds in the trust account totaled
approximately US 120 million. 

On
February 7, 2023, EVGR issued an unsecured promissory note to its Sponsor, in the amount of US 1,150,000, which amount was deposited into
the trust account to extend the available time to complete a business combination to May 11, 2023. None of the funds held in trust will
be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an
initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if EVGR has not consummated a business combination
by May 11, 2023 (or August 11, 2023, if further extended). 

As
of February 28, 2023, we had approximately US 131,284 of unused net proceeds that were not deposited into the trust fund to pay future
general and administrative expenses. The net proceeds deposited into the trust fund remain on deposit in the trust fund earning interest. 

EVGR
Units, Public Shares, and EVGR Warrants are each quoted on Nasdaq, under the symbols EVGRU, EVGR, and EVGRW, 
respectively. Each of EVGR Units consist of one ordinary share and one redeemable warrant. EVGR Units commenced trading on February 9,
2022. Public Shares and EVGR Warrants commenced trading on April 1, 2022. 

3 

Redemption
Rights 

Pursuant
to EVGR s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, EVGR shareholders (except the initial shareholders and the
officers and directors of EVGR) will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata share of the trust account (currently anticipated
to be approximately US 10.27 per ordinary share for shareholders) net of taxes payable. 

EVGR s
initial shareholders do not have redemption rights with respect to any EVGR Shares owned by them, directly or indirectly (nor will they
seek appraisal rights with respect to such ordinary shares if appraisal rights would be available to them). 

Automatic
Dissolution and Subsequent Liquidation of trust account if No Business Combination 

If
we do not consummate an initial business combination by May 11, 2023 (or August 11, 2023, if further extended), it will trigger our automatic
winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of EVGR s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Cayman Companies
Act. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. 

The
amount in the trust account under the Cayman Companies Act will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Cayman Companies
Act provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts
as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute
to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date
(including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought
against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our
public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that
may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent
of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek
to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with
our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements.
Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust
account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable. 

Each
of our initial shareholders and our Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or
other assets with respect to the Insider Shares and Private Placement Units and to vote their Insider Shares and private shares in favor
of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account
with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless. 

If
we are unable to consummate a business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in
the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share distribution from the
trust account would be approximately US 10.27. 

The
proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims
of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses
or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held
in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even
if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited
to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability
of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account.
If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis
of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest
of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party
that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed
by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis
of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management
believed that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there
is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any
negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.

Evergreen
LLC, our Sponsor, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be
liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered
or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent
necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed
a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do
so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than US 10.15 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced
to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust
account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third
parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure
you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least US 10.15 per share. 

Facilities
and Headquarters 

We
maintain our principal executive offices at 15-04, The Pinnacle, Persiaran Lagoon, Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia and
our telephone number is +1 786 406 6082. The cost for this space is provided to us by Evergreen LLC, as part of the US 10,000 per month
payment we make to it for office space and related services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 

Employees 

We
have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to
devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based
on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company
is in. We expected our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which
could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we
move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). Accordingly, as management has located a suitable
target business to acquire, they are presently spending more time negotiating and processing the Business Combination than they were
previously in locating and investigating target businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation
of the Business Combination. 

For
additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on February
10, 2022.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

As
of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our prospectus filed
with the SEC on February 10, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. In addition to these risk factors, the Company has identified the following additional risk factors: 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of November 30, 2022, the Company had 301,228 in cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital surplus of 391,748. Further,
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you
that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial business combination will be successful. These factors, among others, raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K do
not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. 

Additional
risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We
may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board
of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate
declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate
declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may

We

were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public
Offering, identifying a target company for an initial business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the Trust Accounts. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

7 

For
the year ended November 30, 2022, we had a net income of 906,058, which consists of formation and operating costs of 420,505, and interest
earned on investments held of 1,326,563. For the period from October
21, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2021 , we had a net loss of 4,860, which consists of formation
and operating costs of 4,860. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern Consideration 

On
February 11, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private placement of an aggregate
of 532,500 units to our sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating total gross proceeds of 5,325,000. 

For
the year ended November 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was 515,885. 

As
of November 30, 2022, we had investments of 118,051,563 held in the Trust Accounts. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in
the Trust Accounts, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Accounts (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting
commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the year ended November 30,
2022, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Accounts. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or
in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Accounts will be used
as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of November 30, 2022, we had cash of 301,228 outside of the Trust Accounts. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Accounts primarily
to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices,
plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material
agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with our initial business combination, our Sponsor
or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Accounts to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our Trust Accounts would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units identical to the
Placement Units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. 

We
do not currently believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business.
However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial
business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business
prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business
combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our initial business
combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business
combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we
will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Accounts. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash
on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

The
Company is within 12 months of its mandatory liquidation as of the time of filing this 10-K. In connection with the Company s assessment
of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination
or the date the Company is required to liquidate. 

8 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or
commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Other
than the below, we do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations
or long-term liabilities. 

Administrative
Services Agreement 

Commencing
on the date that our securities are first listed, we agreed to pay the Sponsor 10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative
services provided to members of our founding team. Upon completion of the initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying such monthly fees. For the year ended November 30, 2022, 100,000 had been paid and charged to operating expenses. There were no amounts
paid or charged for the period from October 21, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2021. 

Registration
Rights 

The
 Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the founder shares, placement units (including
securities contained therein), units (including securities contained therein) that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans,
any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the placement warrants and any Class A ordinary shares and warrants (and underlying
Class A ordinary shares) that may be issued upon conversion of the units issued as part of the working capital loans and Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon conversion of the founder shares will be entitled to registration are entitled to registration rights pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the IPO. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to
two demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of the initial business combination. We
will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Underwriting
Agreement 

On
February 11, 2022, we paid an underwriting discount of 2 of the per Unit offering price, or approximately 2,300,000 in the aggregate
at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, and the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross
proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or 4,025,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will be payable to the underwriters from the
amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting
agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:

ITEM
7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company we are not required to make disclosures under this Item.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November
30, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited
exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of
independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors. 

Audit
Committee 

The
Audit Committee, which is established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, engages Company s independent
accountants, reviewing their independence and performance; reviews EVGR s accounting and financial reporting processes and the
integrity of its financial statements; the audits of EVGR s financial statements and the appointment, compensation, qualifications,
independence and performance of EVGR s independent auditors; EVGR s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and
the performance of EVGR s internal audit function and internal control over financial reporting. 

The
members of the Audit Committee are Lim Wai Loong (Alan), Dr. Mohamad Zabidi Bin Ahmad and Alberto Coronado Santos, each of whom is an
independent director under NASDAQ s listing standards. Our board of directors has determined that each of Mohamad Zabidi Bin Ahmad,
Lim Wai Loong and Alberto Coronado Santos meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10A-3(b)(1)
of the Exchange Act. Mohamad Zabidi Bin Ahmad serves as the chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially
literate and our board of directors has determined that Mohamad Zabidi Bin Ahmad qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

13 

Compensation
Committee 

The
Compensation Committee reviews EVGR s corporate goals and objectives relevant to the officers compensation, evaluates the
officers performance in light of such goals and objectives, determines and approves the officers compensation level based
on this evaluation; makes recommendations to the board regarding approval, disapproval, modification, or termination of existing or proposed
employee benefit plans, makes recommendations to the board with respect to non-CEO and non-CFO compensation and administers EVGR s
incentive-compensation plans and equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its responsibilities
to subcommittees as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion. The chief executive officer of EVGR may not be present during voting
or deliberations of the Compensation Committee with respect to his compensation. EVGR s executive officers do not play a role in
suggesting their own salaries. Neither EVGR nor the Compensation Committee has engaged any compensation consultant who has a role in
determining or recommending the amount or form of executive or director compensation. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as indicated above, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to
any of our existing shareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effect, the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an
initial business combination, the Compensation Committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation
arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The
members of the Compensation Committee are Lim Wai Loong (Alan), Dr. Mohamad Zabidi Bin Ahmad and Alberto Coronado Santos, each of whom
is an independent director under NASDAQ s listing standards. Lim Wai Loong serves as chairman of the compensation committee. 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity
that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. 

Director
Nominations 

We
do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required
to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend
a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily
carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Lim Wai Loong (Alan), Dr. Mohamad
Zabidi Bin Ahmad, and Alberto Coronado Santos. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent.
As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

The
board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our shareholders during such times as they are
seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of shareholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of shareholders).
Our shareholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 

We
have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess.
In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of
professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent
the best interests of our shareholders. 

14 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons
who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our ordinary shares and other equity securities. These executive
officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
forms filed by such reporting persons. 

Based
solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing
requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities
laws. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Employment
Agreements 

We
have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon
termination of employment. 

Officer
and Director Compensation 

None
of our officers has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on February 8, 2022, we agreed to pay our
sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. No compensation of any kind, including any finder s
fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors,
or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were
made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will
be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to
have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting
or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed initial business
combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or
members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination,
because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee
constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any
agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

On
November 22, 2021, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per unit, for the purchase of 2,875,000 Founder
Shares, par value 0.0001. The number of Insider Shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such Insider Shares would
represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of the IPO (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). The Insider
Shares (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred,
assigned or sold by the holder. 

On
February 11, 2022, the Sponsor purchased 532,500 placement units for a purchase price of 10.00 per unit in a private placement that
occurred simultaneously with the closing of the IPO. There are no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to the Insider Shares, placement shares or placement warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business
combination within the allotted 12-month period (or 18 months, if extended). 

Commencing
on February 8, 2022, we agreed to pay to Evergreen LLC, the Sponsor, 10,000 per month for up to 18 months for office space, utilities
and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying
these monthly fees. 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity
to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual
obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

No
compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid to the Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of
their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination.
However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such
as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review
on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates and will determine
which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

Related
Party Extensions Loan 

On
February 7, 2023, EVGR issued a note to the Sponsor in the amount of US 1,150,000, pursuant to which such amount had been deposited into
the trust account in order to extend the amount of available time to consummate a business combination until May 11, 2023. The Note is
non-interest bearing and is payable upon the closing of a business combination. In addition, the Note may be converted, at the lender s
discretion, into additional EVGR Units, which are the same as the Private Placement Units, at a price of US 10.00 per unit.

Related
Party Policy 

Our
board of directors has adopted an audit committee charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of related party
transactions, which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the
SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing or proposed
related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the company has already committed
to, the business purpose of the transaction and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related party. Any
member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting
on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all
of the committee s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party transaction,
the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members
of the audit committee, present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, will be required in order to approve a related party transaction.
A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of
all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. Our audit committee will review on
a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to the Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or any of their affiliates. 

These
procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a
conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to
consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of the Sponsor, officers or directors unless we,
or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member
of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Except
as provided herein, no finder s fees, reimbursements, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation
will be paid by us to the Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of the Sponsor, officers or directors prior to, for services
rendered to us prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, the following payments will be made to the Sponsor, officers
or directors, or our or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the IPO held in the trust account prior
to the completion of our initial business combination: 

Repayment
 of up to an aggregate of 300,000 in loans made to us by the Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses; 

Payment
 to Evergreen LLC, the Sponsor, of 10,000 per month, for up to 12 months (subject to a six-month extension), for office space, utilities
 and secretarial and administrative support; 

Reimbursement
 for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination; and 

Repayment
 of non-interest-bearing loans which may be made by the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors
 to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms of which (other than as described
 above) have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans
 may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business
 combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. 

Our
audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Evergreen
Corporation 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Evergreen Corporation (the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and
the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2022 and for the period
from October 21, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2022 and
the period from October 21, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within
a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a
redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . 

The
Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does
not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which
may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business
Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or
stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct
the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender
offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

If,
however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company
decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to
redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder
or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held
by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination
or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined
below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless
the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months (or 15 months, or 18 months, as applicable from the closing of
the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights
as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s
warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 

The
holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in
or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the
Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to
their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will
be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 

. Moreover, in the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account
due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered
accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the
Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Going
Concern and Management s Plan 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it
pursues an initial business combination target. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist
solely of pursuing a Business Combination. 

The
Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its shareholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s
working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier
of consummation of a Business Combination or the deadline to complete a Business Combination pursuant to the Company s Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (unless otherwise amended by shareholders). 

While
the Company expects to have sufficient access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part
of any financing source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately
be available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. There is no assurance that the Company s plans
to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful or successful
within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As
is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination
Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business
Combination during the Combination Period.

or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal,
in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion

of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion
of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire 
after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is
available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is
available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares
to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under
the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. 

The
Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination,
the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within 60 business days following a Business Combination to have
declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding
the above, if the Class A ordinary shares is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such
that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at
its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in
effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable
blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

Exhibit
4.5 

DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES 

We
are a Cayman Islands exempted company and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association,
the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association,
we are authorized to issue 479,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, as well as 1,000,000 preference
shares, 0.0001 par value each. The following description summarizes certain terms of our shares as set out more particularly in our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that
is important to you. 

Units 

Each
unit has an offering price of 10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one redeemable warrant. Only whole warrants are exercisable.
Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise his, her or its warrants only for a whole number of Class A ordinary
shares. 

Placement
Units 

The
placement units are identical to the units sold in our initial public offering
(the IPO except that (a) the placement units and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or salable
until 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination except to permitted transferees, and (b) the placement shares
and placement warrants will be entitled to registration rights. 

Ordinary
Shares 

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO, there were 2,875,000 founder shares issued
and outstanding, all of which were held of record by our initial shareholders. The founder shares held by our initial shareholders will
represent at least 20 of our outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the completion of the IPO (excluding any placement units
and assuming our initial shareholders do not purchase any public shares in the IPO), with the potential to own as a result of their founder
shares in the aggregate up to 22.96 of the outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of the IPO (including the placement shares) based
on certain triggering events. 

Upon
the closing of the IPO, 12,980,000 ordinary shares were outstanding (including
the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option), consisting of: 

12,032,500 ordinary shares underlying the units offered in the IPO and
the placement units; and 

2,875,000 Class B ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders and
representative. 

Shareholders
of record are entitled to one vote for each share held (on an as-converted to Class A ordinary shares basis) on all matters to be voted
on by shareholders. Prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the
appointment of directors. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder
shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association may be amended only by approval of the holders of at least 90 of the outstanding founder shares. With respect to any
other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except
as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share
entitling the holder to one vote for each share held (on an as-converted to Class A ordinary shares basis). 

Unless
specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or as required by applicable provisions of the Companies
Act or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our ordinary shares that are voted is required to approve
any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve
for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to
the election of directors, meaning, following our initial business combination that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted
for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and
if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. 

Because
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 479,000,000 Class A ordinary shares,
if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase
the number of Class A ordinary shares which we will be authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the initial business
combination to the extent we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. 

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of
directors being appointed in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, meaning, following
our initial business combination that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the appointment of directors can elect all
of the directors. However, only holders of founder shares
 will have the right to appoint directors in any election held prior to or in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination, meaning that holders of Class A ordinary shares will not have the right to appoint any
directors until after the completion of our initial business combination. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends
when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. 

In
accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after
our first fiscal year end following our listing on the Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual
or general meetings or appoint directors. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination. Prior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors
may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial
business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. 

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and
if needed dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be 10.15 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors
who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. 

The
redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial owner must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our
sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed
to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion
of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business
combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate
the initial business combination. Unlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction
with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial
business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange
rule and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with
the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. 

2 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial
and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC s proxy rules.
If, however, a shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain shareholder
approval for business or other reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete
our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. However, the participation of our sponsor,
officers, directors, advisors or their respective affiliates in privately negotiated transactions, if any, could result in the approval
of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against
such initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will
have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. 

If
we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public
shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as
a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to
Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares)
for or against our initial business combination. Our shareholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence
over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment
if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect
to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that
number of shares exceeding 15 and, in order to dispose of such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions,
potentially at a loss. 

If
we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination,
pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have agreed
to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO, in favor of our initial business combination. As
a result, in the event that only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum is present at a shareholders meeting held to
vote on our initial business combination, in addition to our initial shareholders founder shares and placement shares, we would
need 265,001, or 2.7 , of the 10,000,000 public shares sold in the IPO to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order
to have our initial business combination approved. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective
of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on, the proposed transaction or abstained from voting. 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we have not completed an initial business combination within the
period to consummate the initial business combination, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the
public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest
to pay taxes and if needed dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any),
subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining
shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under the Companies Act to provide
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our sponsor and members of our management team have entered into
letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial
business combination. However, if our sponsor or members of our management team acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time period. 

3 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share
ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each
class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights.
There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our public shareholders with the
opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash at a per unit price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up
to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares,
upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. 

Founder
Shares and Placement Shares 

The
founder shares and placement shares are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold in the IPO, and
holders of founder shares and placement shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (i) the founder shares
and placement shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, (ii) our sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (A) to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares, placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination, (B) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares, and public shares in connection
with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination
or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to two three-month extensions of time by depositing into the trust account for each three month extension 1,000,000,
or 1,150,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full 0.10 per unit in either case) or (ii) with respect
to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (C) to waive
their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares or placement shares held by them
if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO (subject to two three-month
extensions of time), although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares
they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such time period, (iii) the founder shares are Class B ordinary
shares that will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one
basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights as described herein and (iv) are entitled to registration rights.
If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed
(and its permitted transferees will agree) pursuant to the letter agreement to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares
purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business
combination. 

In
the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial
business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate,
on an as-converted basis, approximately 20 of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of
the IPO (without giving effect to the private placement and assuming they do not purchase any units in the IPO), plus the
total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities
or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination,
excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued,
or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement-equivalent units issued to our sponsor,
officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans; provided that such conversion of founder shares will never occur on a
less than one for one basis. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our founder shares at the time of
any future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. 

4 

Prior
to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors.
Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the
completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors
for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special
resolution approved by the holders of at least 90 of the outstanding founder shares . With
respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination,
except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with
each share entitling the holder to one vote. 

Preference
shares 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will authorize 1,000,000 preference shares and provide that those preference
shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if
any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations
and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without shareholder approval,
issue preference shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of
the ordinary shares and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder
approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management.
We have no preference shares issued and outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any preference shares,
we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No preference shares were issued or registered in the IPO. 

Register
of Members 

Under
Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there will be entered therein: 

the
 names and addresses of the members and a statement of the shares held by each member, which: 

distinguishes
 each share by its number (so long as the share has a number); 

confirms
 the amount paid, or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member; 

confirms
 the number and category of shares held by each member; and 

confirms
 whether each relevant category of shares held by a member carries voting rights under the articles of association of the company,
 and if so, whether such voting rights are conditional; 

the
 date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and 

the
 date on which any person ceased to be a member. 

For
these purposes, voting rights means rights conferred on shareholders in respect of their shares to vote at general meetings
of the company on all or substantially all matters. A voting right is conditional where the voting right arises only in certain circumstances. 

Under
Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e., the register
of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register
of members will be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register
of members. Upon the closing of this public offering, the register of members will be immediately updated to record and give effect to
the issuance of shares by us to the custodian or its nominee. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded
in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name. 

If
the name of any person is incorrectly entered in or omitted from our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay
in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a shareholder of our company, the person or shareholder aggrieved
(or any shareholder of our company or our company itself) may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands for an order that the register
be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for
the rectification of the register. 

5 

Public
Shareholders Warrants 

No
warrants are currently outstanding. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of
 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the effective date
of this registration statement and the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement,
a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares. 

However,
no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective
within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there
is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement,
exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such
exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants
on a cashless basis. 

In
the event of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A
ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants,
multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y)
the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the Class
A ordinary shares for the five (5) trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on
the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption
or liquidation. 

The
placement warrants, as well as any warrants underlying additional units we issue to our sponsor, officers, directors, initial shareholders
or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to us, are identical to the warrants underlying the units offered in our
initial public offering. 

We
may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, 

at any time
 after the warrants become exercisable, 

upon not less than 30 days 
 prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder 

if, and only if, the reported
 last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends,
 reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing at any time after the warrants
 become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and 

if, and only if, there
 is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants. 

The
right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and
after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder s
warrant upon surrender of such warrant. 

The
redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium
to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then- prevailing share price and the warrant exercise
price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below
the exercise price of the warrants. 

6 

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants
for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary
shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value 
(defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last
sale price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 5 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice
of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 

The
warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as warrant
agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder (i) to
cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms
of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the prospectus filed in connection with our initial public offering, or to cure,
correct or supplement any defective provision, or (ii) to add or change any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising
under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not
adversely affect the interests of the registered holders of the warrants. The warrant agreement requires the approval, by written consent
or vote, of the holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the
interests of the registered holders. 

The
exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except
as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A ordinary shares at a price below their respective exercise
prices. 

In
addition, if (x) we issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with
the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue
price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors, and in the case of any such issuance to our
sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by them prior to such issuance),
(y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available
for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions),
and (z) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to
be equal to 115 of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger price
of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the Newly Issued
Price. 

The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full
payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant
holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants
and receive Class A ordinary shares. After the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be
entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. 

Warrant
holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be
able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess
of 9.8 of the Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 

No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive
a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares
to be issued to the warrant holder. 

We
have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the
warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will
be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. See Risk Factors - Our warrant agreement will designate the
courts of the State of New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, as the sole and exclusive forum for
certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders
to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company . This exclusive forum provision shall not apply to suits
brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United
States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. 

7 

Placement
Units 

The
placement units (and underlying placement shares and placement warrants) are identical to the units and warrants sold in the IPO 
e xcept as described below. The placement warrants (including
the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30
days after the completion of our initial business combination (except, among other things, to our officers and directors and other persons
or entities affiliated with our sponsor). Permitted transferees of the founder shares held by our
sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors would be subject to the same restrictions. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans
may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination.
The units would be identical to the placement units. However, as the units would not be issued until consummation of our initial business
combination, any warrants underlying such units would not be able to be voted on an amendment to the warrant agreement in connection
with such business combination. Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the placement warrants (including the Class
A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of any of these warrants) until the date that is 30 days after the date we complete our initial
business combination, except that, among other limited exceptions, to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated
with our sponsor. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do
not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be
dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial conditions subsequent to completion of a
business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board
of directors at such time. If we increase or decrease the size of the offering we may effect a share dividend or a share contribution
back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our founder shares immediately prior to the consummation
of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial shareholders at 20.0 of the issued and outstanding ordinary
shares (excluding the placement units and the underlying securities and any units or shares purchased in the open market) upon the consummation
of the IPO. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree
to in connection therewith. 

Our
Transfer Agent 

The
transfer agent for our ordinary shares is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock
Transfer Trust Company in its role as transfer agent, its agents and each of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees
against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any claims
and losses due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity. 

Certain
Differences in Corporate Law 

Cayman
Islands companies are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act is modeled on English law but does not follow recent English law
statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary
of the material differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated
in the United States and their shareholders. 

8 

Mergers
and Similar Arrangements 

In
certain circumstances, the Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands companies, or between a Cayman
Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction). 

Where
the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger
or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a)
a special resolution (usually a majority of 66-2/3 in value of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders of
each company; or (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company s articles of association.
No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company i.e., a company that owns at least 90 of the issued
shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security
interest of a constituent company must be obtained unless the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands waives such requirement. If the Cayman
Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Act (which includes certain other formalities) have
been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation. 

Where
the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the
directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they
are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited
by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated,
and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition
or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign
company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction
and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise
or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company
are and continue to be suspended or restricted. 

Where
the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required
to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been
met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidated is bona fide and not
intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted
by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or
waived, (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company,
and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that
the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the
laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit
the merger or consolidation. 

9 

Where
the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair
value of his shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure
is as follows (a) the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the
vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger
or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by
the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder
must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his
intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within seven days following
the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger
or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a
written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the
company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder
such amount; and (e) if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20 days following the
date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand
Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders
with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any,
to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list
filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting
shareholder are not available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an
open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration
for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated
company. 

Moreover,
Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances,
schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly
referred to in the Cayman Islands as a scheme of arrangement which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger
was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures
typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number
of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent seventy-five percent
in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy
at a meeting, or meeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must
be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the
view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that: 

we are not
 proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been
 complied with; 

the shareholders have been
 fairly represented at the meeting in question; 

the arrangement is such
 as a businessman would reasonably approve; and 

the arrangement is not
 one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act or that would amount to a fraud
 on the minority. 

If
a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable
to appraisal rights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise
ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations. 

Squeeze-out
Provisions . When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90 of the shares to whom the offer relates is made within four
months, the offeror may, within a two-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms
of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence
of fraud, bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders. 

Further,
transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than
these statutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements, of an
operating business. 

10 

Shareholders 
Suits 

The
Cayman Islands Grand Court Rules allow shareholders to seek leave to bring derivative actions in the name of the company against wrongdoers.
In most cases, we will normally be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example)
our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English
authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to
the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which: 

a company is
 acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority; 

the act complained of,
 although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have
 actually been obtained; or 

those who control the company
 are perpetrating a fraud on the minority. 

A
shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about
to be infringed. 

Enforcement
of Civil Liabilities 

The
Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to investors. Additionally,
Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States. 

We
have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would
(i) recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, impose liabilities against
us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities
imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. We have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman
Islands would recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the federal or state courts
of the United States against our company under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple
damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam
 judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (a) such courts had proper jurisdiction over
the parties subject to such judgment, (b) such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands, (c) such
judgment was not obtained by fraud, (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands,
(e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman
Islands, and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands. 

Special
Considerations for Exempted Companies 

We
are an exempted company with limited liability (meaning our public shareholders have no liability, as members of the company, for liabilities
of the company over and above the amount paid for their shares) under the Companies Act. The Companies Act distinguishes between ordinary
resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside
of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the
same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and: 

annual reporting
 requirements are minimal and consist mainly of a statement that the company has conducted its operations mainly outside of the Cayman
 Islands and has complied with the provisions of the Companies Act; 

an exempted company s
 register of members is not open to inspection; 

an exempted company does
 not have to hold an annual general meeting; 

an exempted company may
 issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value; 

11 

an exempted
 company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years
 in the first instance); 

an exempted company may
 register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands; 

an exempted company may
 register as a limited duration company; and 

an exempted company may
 register as a segregated portfolio company. 

Amended
and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 

The
Business Combination Article of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions designed to provide
certain rights and protections relating to the IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination.
These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special
resolution where it has been approved by either (i) at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company s articles
of association) of a company s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution
as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company s articles of association, by a unanimous written
resolution of all of the company s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any
special resolutions require approval by at least two-thirds of our shareholders (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman
Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders. 

Our
initial shareholders, who collectively beneficially own 22.96 of our outstanding
ordinary shares upon (including the placement shares and any units or shares purchased in the open market), will participate in any vote
to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose.
Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that: 

if we are unable
 to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (subject to one three-month extension
 of time), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more
 than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
 then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up
 to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will
 completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
 if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders
 and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman
 Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law; 

prior to our initial business
 combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account
 or (ii) vote on our initial business combination; 

although we do not intend
 to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our officers, we
 are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will
 obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a valuation or appraisal firm that such a business combination is
 fair to our company from a financial point of view; 

if a shareholder vote on
 our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal
 reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender
 offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial
 and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the
 Exchange Act; 

12 

if our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial
business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from
the closing of the IPO (subject to one three-month extension of time) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to
shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity
to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released
to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein; and 

we will not effectuate
 our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

In
addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will not redeem our public shares in an amount
that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked
securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to
forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements, in order to, among other
reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets requirement. 

The
Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval
of a special resolution. A company s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but,
provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles
of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend
any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor
our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem their public shares. 

Anti-Money
Laundering-Cayman Islands 

In
order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering, we are required to adopt and maintain anti-money
laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity, the identity of their beneficial owners/controllers
and source of funds. Where permitted, and subject to certain conditions, we may also delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering
procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person. 

We
reserve the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a subscriber. In some cases, the directors may
be satisfied that no further information is required since an exemption applies under the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (2020 Revision)
of the Cayman Islands, as amended and revised from time to time (the Regulations ). Depending on the circumstances of each
application, a detailed verification of identity might not be required. 

We
also reserve the right to refuse to make any payment to a shareholder if our directors or officers suspect or are advised that the payment
to such shareholder may be non-compliant with applicable anti-money laundering or other laws or regulations, or if such refusal is considered
necessary or appropriate to ensure our compliance with any such laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction. If any person resident
in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal
conduct or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention
in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to
report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime
Act (2020 Revision) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer
of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman
Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report will not be treated
as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.

Islands Data Protection 

Data
Protection - Cayman Islands - Privacy Notice 

This
privacy notice explains the manner in which the Company collects, processes and maintains personal data about investors of the Company
pursuant to the Data Protection Act (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, as amended from time to time and any regulations, codes of practice
or orders promulgated pursuant thereto (the DPA ). 

The
Company is committed to processing personal data in accordance with the DPA. In its use of personal data, the Company will be characterized

in connection with services provided to the Company. 

By
virtue of making an investment in the Company, the Company and certain of the Company s service providers may collect, record,
store, transfer and otherwise process personal data by which individuals may be directly or indirectly identified. 

Your
personal data will be processed fairly and for lawful purposes, including (a) where the processing is necessary for the Company to perform
a contract to which you are a party or for taking pre-contractual steps at your request (b) where the processing is necessary for compliance
with any legal, tax or regulatory obligation to which the Company is subject or (c) where the processing is for the purposes of legitimate
interests pursued by the Company or by a service provider to whom the data are disclosed. As a data controller, we will only use your
personal data for the purposes for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will contact
you. 

We
anticipate that we will share your personal data with the Company s service providers for the purposes set out in this privacy
notice. We may also share relevant personal data where it is lawful to do so and necessary to comply with our contractual obligations
or your instructions or where it is necessary or desirable to do so in connection with any regulatory reporting obligations. In exceptional
circumstances, we will share your personal data with regulatory, prosecuting and other governmental agencies or departments, and parties
to litigation (whether pending or threatened), in any country or territory including to any other person where we have a public or legal
duty to do so (e.g. to assist with detecting and preventing fraud, tax evasion and financial crime or compliance with a court order). 

Your
personal data shall not be held by the Company for longer than necessary with regard to the purposes of the data processing. We will
not sell your personal data. Any transfer of personal data outside of the Cayman Islands shall be in accordance with the requirements

Certain
Anti-Takeover Provisions of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes
of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest
at two or more annual general meetings. Our authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and preference shares are available for future
issuances without shareholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise
additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A ordinary
shares and preference shares could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest,
tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions
designed to provide certain requirements and restrictions relating to the IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our initial
business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a special resolution, being a resolution of a duly constituted
general meeting of the Company that is passed by a majority of two thirds of the votes cast by, or on behalf of, the shareholders entitled
to vote thereon. Our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that: 

If we have
 not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, we will (i) cease
 all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter,
 redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
 including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less
 up to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding public
 shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
 further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the
 approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations
 under the Companies Act to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; 

Prior to or in connection
 with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive
 funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on our initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders
 prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination; 

Although we do not intend
 to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our executive officers,
 we are not prohibited from doing so, and in the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors,
 will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting
 firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 

15 

Furthermore,
 in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be
 involved in the process for considering, and approving the transaction; 

If a shareholder vote on
 our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule and we do not decide to hold a shareholder
 vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange
 Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially
 the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation
 14A of the Exchange Act; 

In accordance with Nasdaq
 rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market
 value of at least 80 of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust
 and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination; 

If our shareholders approve
 an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our
 obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do
 not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, or with respect to
 any other provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public
 shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price,
 payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held
 in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and
 if needed, dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described
 herein; and 

We will not effectuate
 our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

In
addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public
shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001. 

Advance
notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our shareholders who are seeking to bring business before our
annual meeting of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, must provide
timely notice of their intent in writing. To be timely, a shareholder s notice will need to be received by the company secretary
at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the opening of business on the
120th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange
Act, proposals seeking inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply with the notice periods contained therein. Our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a shareholders 
meeting. These provisions may preclude our shareholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of shareholders or from making
nominations for directors at our annual meeting of shareholders. 

Classified
board of directors 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, Class
I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Subject to
the terms of any preference shares, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by
the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement
of our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office. 

Class
B Ordinary Shares Consent Right 

For
so long as any founder shares remain outstanding, we may not, without the prior vote or voting separately as a single class, amend, alter
or repeal any provision of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise,
if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or
special rights of the founder shares. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of our founder shares
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding founder shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all founder shares were present and voted.
