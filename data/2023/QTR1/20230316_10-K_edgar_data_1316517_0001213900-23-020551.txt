Item 1. Business Introduction 

Our Core Business 

Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. Kandi Technologies is a
Delaware holding company, with its common stock being traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a holding company with no material
operations of its own, a substantial majority of the operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries established in the
People s Republic of China, or the PRC, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies Group, Co. Ltd. Zhejiang Kandi Technologies and its subsidiaries and U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries SC Autosports, LLC SC Autosports and its subsidiary. 

Originally, the Company s primary business
operations consist of designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing electric vehicle EV products and EV parts.
However, in recent years, some EV enterprises in China are seizing market share at the cost of huge losses. The Company gradually realized
that the EV market of China has not reached a healthy and orderly development stage. Therefore, with our financial condition, it is unwise
to participate in this loss competition at this stage. The Company always firmly believes that only with the maturity of
changing-battery-model can EVs be truly popularized. Since the Company has advanced EV intelligent battery swap equipment, large manufacturing
capacity of EV with intelligent battery swap mode and dozens of patented technologies in battery swap, the Company s development
strategy in the field of online car hailing with battery swap mode has been adjusted to continue to explore and improve in the way of
small batch trial operation, and will join back in such business when the EV market of China enters a healthy and orderly development
stage. Now with the global trend of fuel to electrification of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious, the market
demand is skyrocketing. In 2022, our PRC entities, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies, Kandi Hainan and Hainan Kandi Holding have applied
EV technology to off-road vehicle products and launched a variety of pure electric utility vehicles UTV ), Neighborhood
EVs NEVs ), Golf carts and off-road crossover vehicles. We will fully enter the off-road vehicle market utilizing the high-end
technology that accumulated by Kandi in the field of EVs over the past years, and strive to achieve a leading position in this field in
China within three years. 

The Company does not believe that our major business is within the
targeted areas of concern by the Chinese government. However, Kandi Technologies is a holding company in Delaware and our majority of
business is conducted through the operations by Company s subsidiaries and pre-existed VIE in the PRC. Therefore, there is a risk
that the Chinese government may in the future seek to affect operations of any company with any level of operations in the PRC, including
its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept
foreign investment. Additionally, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations in China. PRC laws
and regulations governing our current business operations are uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result in a material change in
the Company s operations, significant depreciation of the value of our common stock, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer
or continue to offer our securities to investors. Due to the fact that PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States and many other countries and regions, direct recognition and enforcement
in PRC of judgments of a court in any of these non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision
may be difficult, time-consuming, costly or even impossible, the investors may even need to sue again in one of the courts under PRC jurisdiction.
Therefore, our investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original
actions based on United States or foreign laws against us or our management. Changes in currency conversion policies in China and fluctuation
in exchange rates may also have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our securities. During the previous few decades,
the economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy
continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Recently, the PRC government
initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including
cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and
expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how
soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations
and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact of such modified or new laws and regulations will
have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a more
detailed description of the risks regarding our business structure, please see Risks Related to Doing Business in China 
in pages 22-29. It is still unclear about the scope and the impact of these new regulations, however, these risks could result in a material
change in the value of our securities or cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

Our Organizational Structure 

The Company s organizational chart as of
the date of this report is as follows: 

Please refer to the discussion in NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION
AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a narrative of our
organization structure and operating subsidiaries, including their dates of incorporation and history. 

Industry Overview 

Over the years, governments and the automobile
manufacturers have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the automobile industry and utilizing various energy resources.
China is one of the world s largest automobile markets. China has relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of
electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been implementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified
market with the coexistence of traditional fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed.
The Company believes China is a huge prospective market for pure electric vehicles. The Company also believes that in the global automobile
industry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicles and their core parts industry in the future. In addition,
with the global trend of fuel to electrification of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious and huge market demand,
management believes this industry still has huge development space.

Competitive Landscape 

In general, the EV and electric off-road vehicles
business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants. 

In terms of competition with conventional fuel
vehicle and off-road vehicles manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing
capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric vehicle and electric off-road vehicles manufacturers.
However, the conventional fuel vehicles and off-road vehicles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution
and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV and electric off-road vehicles industry. 

Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy 

Due to worsening air pollution and concerns about
petroleum resource dependence, the new energy industry is developing vigorously. Given its technology innovation with integrated solutions
and operation experience, Kandi has benefited from the development of EV and electric off-road vehicles industry. 

The Company s business strategy includes
efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand the footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile
and the market demand through the further innovations. The Company also provides products to end users through our distributors. 

In recent years, some EV enterprises in China are taking market shares
at the expense of huge losses, which has caused big hurdles to the completion of 300,000 government-accredited ride-sharing vehicles
within 5 years (the Online Ride-Sharing Project initiated by the Company, However, the Company always firmly believes
that only with the maturity of changing-battery-model can EVs be truly popularized. Since the Company has advanced EV intelligent battery
swap equipment, large manufacturing capacity of EV with intelligent battery swap mode and dozens of patented technologies in battery swap,
the Company s development strategy in the field of online car hailing with battery swap mode has been adjusted to continue to explore
and improve in the way of small batch trial operation, and will join back in such business model when the EV market of China enters a
healthy and orderly development stage. 

SC Autosports is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kandi Technology based in Dallas specialized in the sales in the United States. It has a seasoned management team with personnel over
ten years of business experience, which has laid a good foundation for the sales of the Company s products in the US market. 

Our Products 

General 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
our products primarily consist of EV parts, EV products, and off-road vehicles including All-Terrain Vehicles ATVs ), UTVs,
go-karts, and electric scooters, electric self-balancing Scooters and associated parts. Based on our market research on consumer demand
trends, the Company has adjusted our production line strategically and continue to develop and manufacture new products in an effort to
meet market demand and better serve our customers.

Sales and Distribution 

Because our products are manufactured in China,
there are two major sales modes of our products sold to the countries and regions other than China market: the first mode is indirect
sales to Chinese import and export trading companies for sales to the countries and regions out of China, and the second is direct sales
to foreign dealers to export the products manufactured in China to the countries and regions out of China. Our products sold in China
are mainly through our sales department to sign sales contracts directly with customers. 

The Company jointly manufactures the K23 model
with Hunan Hengrun Automobile Co., Ltd. Hengrun ), whose manufacture license was granted in June 2022. This product is sold
in the China market through our sales department by signing sales contracts directly with customers. 

During 2020, SC Autosports received the required clearance from the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models the K23 and K27 via Certificates
of Conformity. However, until now, the airbags of the products have not met the technical requirements of the United States. The Company
decided to give up the launch of these two models in the U.S. market after careful consideration due to the fact that the exterior design
of them are outdated and uncompetitive since both models are developed in 2015, in addition to the great uncertainties in fulfilling the
requirements of United States Department of Transportation, which triggers great investment. Currently, the low-speed versions (NEV) of
K23 and K27, which are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States, and now have
gradually begun to be delivered to customers. Since the beginning of 2021, SC Autosports has been signing up and delivering NEV to Kandi s
dealers. The potential buyers can reserve a NEV K23 or K27 by paying a fully unconditionally refundable 100 deposit on our website. Once
SC Autosports receives the reservation fee and request, it will pass the reservation to dealers, who will then contact the potential buyers
to complete the purchase process, the completion of which is subject to which payment method the buyers may utilize and the approval of
a bank if a loan is needed. Regarding the latest model off-road UTV K32, similar to NEV K23 and K27, SC Autosports is taking reservations
made through its website. Please be advised that SC Autosports is using online reservations as a lead generator for our dealerships. The
final sales will be completed by our dealers. The prototypes shown on our website will be the final models for delivery. Currently SC
Autosports sells through the authorized dealers covering more than thirty states, from western coast to eastern coast in the U.S. for
its NEV and off-road vehicles. SC Autosports also sells parts and youth vehicles on its website www.partsBoss.com. 

In addition, SC Autosports has established a partnership
with Lowe s Supermarket at the end of 2022, and consumers can also purchase our products directly at Lowe s Supermarket.

Selected Condensed Consolidated Financial Schedule 

The consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-K reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the registrant, Delaware incorporated parent
company together with those of its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis. 

The Company has completed the conversion of Kandi
New Energy to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Kandi Technologies, effective March 14, 2022. The Company no longer has any VIE subsequent
to March 14, 2022. Therefore, we have 100 control and ownership of our subsidiaries. There is no limitation or restriction imposed by
the regulations regarding fund transfer within companies. Our cash management policy basically is to allocate the cash resources based
on the needs and projection of each subsidiary within the Company group. Although the purpose of all transfers needs to be business operation-related,
there is no strict limitation on how much cash can be transferred, because the Company treats all subsidiaries as a whole group under
the Company s policy of the fund transfer. The cash transfer is requested when needed and approved by authorized persons based on
the amount of cash transfer. 

For accounting purpose, the tables below are condensed
consolidating schedules summarizing separately the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the parent company including
non-VIE subsidiaries and Kandi New Energy, which was deemed as an VIE since the Company only owned 50 of the equity, and control Kandi
New Energy through several contractual agreements prior to its conversion to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Kandi Technologies
effective March 14, 2022, together with eliminating adjustments:

Environmental and Safety Regulation 

Emissions 

Our products are all subject to international
laws and emissions related standards and regulations, including regulations and related standards established by China Environmental Protection
Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and European and Canadian legislative bodies. 

According to the management s knowledge,
the Company s products have been designed and developed according to the environmental regulations of the target market since the
research and development period, and have passed the corresponding tests before the products are put into production and sales, and obtained
the compulsory product certification of the corresponding countries and regions. 

If the standards and rules are modified, or interpreted
differently, or the product certification certificate expires, the Company will evaluate the product and restart the corresponding product
design improvement and product testing/certification procedures to continuously ensure the target market environment regulatory compliance.
The Company cannot estimate the extent to which these changes, if any, will affect our operating costs in the future. 

Product Safety and Regulation 

Safety Regulation 

The U.S. federal government and individual states
have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi s products. The federal
government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC has federal oversight
over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration NHTSA has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and regulates the safety of electric vehicles for road vehicles. 

In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement
Act (the Product Safety Act was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into
or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America ANSI/SVIA safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers
and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously
in effect. Both Kandi and SC Autosports currently comply with the ANSI/SVIA standard. 

11 

Kandi s off-road vehicles are subject to
federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety
standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles. 

Kandi s off-road vehicles are also subject
to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle
products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally. 

The low-speed versions (NEV) of K23 and K27, which
are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States.

Those listed above constitute all the requisite
permissions or approvals the Company and its subsidiaries required to operate business. The Company and its subsidiaries have never been
denied any applications concerning any permissions or approvals. If the Company or its subsidiaries does not receive or maintain such
permissions or approvals, or mistakenly conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, our business may be adversely affected.
In the scenario when the Company does get denied such permissions, the Company would either avoid such field of business, or collaborate
with parties that can obtain such permissions. Currently the PRC legal system is under constant development and applicable laws, regulations,
or interpretations are subject to substantial uncertainties. If relevant rules suddenly change, we will have to obtain such permissions
or approvals, which may be costly, and may temporarily halt our operation of business, negatively affecting our revenues and our securities 
value. 

CAC Review 

As advised by our PRC Counsel, Zhejiang Lizhou
(Jinhua) Law Firm, as of the date of this report, (i) the Company does not hold personal information of over one million users; (ii) the
Company and its subsidiaries have not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it file for a cybersecurity
review; and (iii) the Company and its subsidiaries have never disclosed any customer or supplier information within China (except when
requested by related parties, the company and its subsidiaries tailor their customer or supplier information disclosures to the narrowest
possible scope), therefore, the Company believes it is not required to pass cybersecurity review of CAC. We are also not aware that there
are relevant laws or regulations in the PRC explicitly requiring us to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for
our overseas listing. Further, as of the date of this report, Kandi Technologies and its subsidiaries 1) did not collect any data that
will or may negatively influence PRC s national security; and 2) strictly follow the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Since these
statements and regulatory actions are new, however, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued. It is highly
uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operations of our subsidiaries,
our ability to accept foreign investments, and our listing on a U.S. exchange. The PRC regulatory authorities may in the future promulgate
laws, regulations, or implementing rules that require us, our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval from Chinese authorities for
listing in the U.S. If we do not receive or maintain the approval, or inadvertently conclude that such approval is not required, or applicable
laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject to an investigation
by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a
material adverse change in our operations and the value of our common stock, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer
or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

CSRC Filing Requirements 

On December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or
the CSRC , published draft regulations (the Draft Rules on domestic enterprises issuing securities and being
listed overseas. The Draft Rules lay out specific filing requirements for overseas listing and offering by PRC domestic companies and
include unified regulation management and strengthening regulatory coordination. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial
Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures ), which will
take effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures supersede the Draft Rules and clarified and emphasized several aspects, which include
but are not limited to: (1) criteria to determine whether an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the Trial
Measures; (2) exemptions from immediate filing requirements for issuers including those that have already been listed or registered but
not yet listed in foreign securities markets, including U.S. markets, prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures; (3) a negative
list of types of issuers banned from listing or offering overseas, such as issuers whose affiliates have been recently convicted of bribery
and corruption; (4) issuers compliance with web security, data security, and other national security laws and regulations; (5)
issuers filing and reporting obligations, such as obligation to file with the CSRC after it submits an application for initial
public offering to overseas regulators, and obligation after offering or listing overseas to report to the CSRC material events including
change of control or voluntary or forced delisting of the issuer; and (6) the CSRC s authority to fine both issuers and their shareholders
for failure to comply with the Trial Measures, including failure to comply with filing obligations or committing fraud and misrepresentation.
Because we are already publicly listed in the U.S., the Trial Measures do not impose additional regulatory burden on us beyond the obligation
to report to the CSRC any future offerings of our securities, or material events such as a change of control or delisting. As the Trial
Measures are newly issued, there remains uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted or implemented. Therefore, there is uncertainty
that if we are subject to such filing requirements under the Trial Measures, we will be able to get clearance from the CSRC in a timely
fashion.

Auditors Regulations 

As auditors of companies that are traded publicly
in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular
inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not
be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese
authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms 
audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality.
We are required by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection
by the PCAOB. While our present auditor is located in the United States and the PCAOB is able to conduct inspections on such auditor,
to the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company
becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB or if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a
position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, trading in our common stock could be prohibited under the HFCAA, and as a result
our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq. 

On May 13, 2021, the PCAOB proposed a new rule
for implementing the HFCAA. Among other things, the proposed rule provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, under the
HFCAA, whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction
because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. The proposed rule would also establish the manner of the
PCAOB s determinations; the factors the PCAOB will evaluate and the documents and information it will consider when assessing whether
a determination is warranted; the form, public availability, effective date, and duration of such determinations; and the process by which
the board of the PCAOB can modify or vacate its determinations. The proposed rule was adopted by the PCAOB on September 22, 2021 and approved
by the SEC on November 5, 2021. 

Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate
passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act AHFCAA ), which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAA and
require the SEC to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB
inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. On December
29, 2022, the AHFCAA was signed into law, and officially reduced the time not subject to PCAOB inspections to two consecutive years. 

While the HFCAA is not currently applicable to
the Company because the Company s current auditors are subject to PCAOB review, if this changes in the future for any reason,
the Company may be subject to the HFCAA. The implications of this regulation if the Company were to become subject to it are uncertain.
Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our common stock to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities could be
delisted or prohibited from being traded on Nasdaq earlier than would be required by the HFCAA. If our common stock is unable
to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase the
common stock when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on
the price of the common stock.

all of our operations in PRC. A majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside PRC. The shareholders
may have to rely on international treaties such as Hague Service Convention for service. In addition, PRC does not have treaties providing
for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States and many other countries and regions. Therefore,
direct recognition and enforcement in PRC of judgments of a court in any such non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject
to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult, time-consuming, costly or even impossible.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

You should carefully consider the risks described
below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities.
The statements contained in or incorporated into this Annual Report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking
statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

Risk Factor Summary 

The following are some material risks, any
of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects. 

Risks
Relating to Our Business 

Our future growth is dependent upon market s willingness to adopt our products and performance of our products in line with customers expectation; 

Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our Products; 

If our PRC operating entities are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle and pure electric off-road vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position;

Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result unpredictable events; 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock; 

15 

Risks
Related to Doing Business in China 

Substantial uncertainties and restrictions on the political and economic policies of the PRC government, PRC laws and regulations which can change quickly with little advance notice, and Chinese government s tendency to intervene or influence the Company s operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition; may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For more detailed description, please refer to the discussion on P22 under such title; 

Adverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like us with China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements; 

Compliance with China s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business; The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval; 

It may be difficult for U.S. regulators, such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, and other authorities, to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China; 

The economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected; 

Changes in currency conversion policies in China and fluctuation in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our securities; 

Investors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us or our management; 

Changes to the government s subsidy support policies and further delays in subsidy payments may have negative impacts on our operations; 

Risks
Associated With the Export of Kandi Electric Vehicles to and sale in the United States 

Failures in our U.S. business may present a risk of significant losses to our business; 

The United States has strict environmental laws and regulations which may cause us to expend significant sums to comply with such laws and regulations; 

Our short-term financial performance may suffer due to our investment in expanding our presence and sales in the United States; 

Lack of authorized dealers and absence of after-sales maintenance may adversely affect our business in the United States; 

16 

Risks
Relating to Ownership of Our Securities 

Our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses for our shareholders; 

We do not anticipate paying cash dividends to our common shareholders; 

Limited monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware Law and the existence of statutory indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees; 

We may require additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders; 

Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance; 

Techniques employed by manipulative short sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock. 

Risks Relating to Our Business 

Our future growth is dependent upon consumers 
willingness to adopt our products. 

Our PRC operating entities growth is highly
dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and they are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles in general
and EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles in particular. The market for alternative fuel vehicles and pure electric off-road vehicles
is relatively new and rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving
government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. If the market
for EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles in China does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business,
prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. 

Developments in alternative technologies
or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our Products. 

Significant developments in alternative technologies,
such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion
engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to develop
new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and
introduction of new and enhanced EV products and Pure Electric off-road vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of
our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. 

If our PRC operating entities are unable
to keep up with advances in electric vehicle and pure electric off-road vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive
position. 

Our PRC operating entities may be unable to keep
up with changes in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology, and they may suffer a resulting decline in the competitive position.
Any failure to keep up with advances in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology would result in a decline in their competitive
position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research
and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in EV and pure electric off-road vehicle technology. As technologies
change, our PRC operating entities plan to upgrade or adapt the vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles
with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our PRC operating entities vehicles may not compete
effectively with alternative vehicles and pure electric off-road vehicles if they are not able to source and integrate the latest technology
into their vehicles. For example, our PRC operating entities do not manufacture battery cells, which makes them dependent upon other suppliers
of battery cell technology for our battery packs. 

17 

Our business depends substantially on the
continuing efforts of our executive officers, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. 

Our future success depends substantially on the
continued services of our executive officers, especially our CEO, Dr. Dong Xueqin and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Hu Xiaoming. We do not
maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers. If any of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue
in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. Therefore, our business may be severely disrupted,
and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers. In addition, if any of our executive officers joins a competitor
or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. 

Our PRC operating entities may be subject
to product liability claims or recalls which could be expensive, damage our reputation or result in a diversion of management resources. 

Our PRC and U.S. operating entities may be subject
to lawsuits resulting from injuries or damages associated with the use of the vehicles that they sell or produce. We may incur losses
relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. While our PRC and U.S. operating entities do maintain product liability insurance,
there is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, we cannot assure the insurance our PRC and
U.S. operating entities currently maintain will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, therefore, we may be unable
to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. 

Our operating entities in PRC or in U.S. may also
be involved in recalls of our vehicles. The vehicles we manufactured may prove to be defective, or our operating entities may voluntarily
initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain
good customer relationships. Such a recall would result in a diversion of resources, extra expenditure of the funds, or damage to our
reputation. Any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. 

We and our PRC operating entities retain
certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws. 

We and our PRC operating entities use the electronic
systems of our vehicles to log information about each vehicle s condition, performance and use in order to aid us in providing customer
service, including vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance. Electronic systems are also used to help us collect data regarding our
customers charging time, battery usage, mileage and efficiency habits to improve our vehicles. We also collect information about
our customers through our website, at our stores and facilities, and via telephone. 

Our customers may object to the processing of
this data, which may negatively impact our ability to provide effective customer service and develop new vehicles and products. Collection
and use of our customers personal information in conducting our business may be subject to national and local laws and regulations
in China, and such laws and regulations may restrict our processing of such personal information and hinder our ability to attract new
customers or market to existing customers. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security
standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Although we take steps to protect the
security of our customers personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements
if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect
to customers personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences
for our businesses and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and
harm to our reputation and brand. 

Our PRC operating entities business
will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third
parties. 

Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary
rights could result in the weakening or loss of such rights, which may allow our competitors to offer similar or identical products or
use identical or confusingly similar branding, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage, a decrease in our
revenue or an attribution of potentially lower quality products to us, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual
property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and
third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright protection, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to
establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing
our vehicles. 

18 

The protection provided by the patent laws is
and will be important to our future opportunities. However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect
our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following: 

our
pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents; 

our
patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our commercial endeavors; 

the
patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented
technology or for other reasons; 

the
costs associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights
may make aggressive enforcement impracticable; or 

current
and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents
our intellectual property. 

Existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality
agreements only afford limited protections. In addition, the laws of some countries, such as PRC, do not protect our proprietary rights
to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, which can lead to more unauthorized use of our intellectual property. 

We may need to defend ourselves against
patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs. 

Companies, organizations or individuals, including
our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability
to make, use, develop, sell or market our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From
time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents
or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and seek licenses.
In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do
one or more of the following: 

cease
selling, incorporating or using vehicles or offering goods or services that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property; 

pay
substantial damages; 

obtain
a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at
all; or 

redesign
our vehicles or other goods or services. 

In the event of a successful claim of infringement
against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right, our business,
prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether
or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. 

We may also face claims that our use of technology
licensed or otherwise obtained from a third party infringes the rights of others, under such case we may not be allowed to continue using
such technology and selling our inventories containing such technology. In such cases, we may seek indemnification from our licensors/suppliers
under our contracts with them. However, indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on
our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors. In addition, we may
have to find substitute to keep using similar technology to our products, which may be time-consuming and costly, if not impossible, upon
such period our sales or manufacture of certain products may be negatively influenced. 

19 

Our PRC operating entities vehicles
make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have the potential to catch fire or vent smoke and flame. This may lead to additional concerns
about batteries used in automotive applications. 

The battery packs in our EV products and pure
electric off-road vehicles make use of lithium-ion cells. Our PRC operating entities also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion
cells in battery packs on any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they
contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Extremely rare incidents
of laptop computers, cell phones and EV battery packs catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. 

These events have raised concerns about batteries
used in EV products and pure electric off-road vehicles applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of battery cell
manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. Our PRC operating entities may have to
recall their vehicles or participate in a recall of a vehicle that contains their battery packs, or redesign their battery packs, which
would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive
applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve
us, could seriously harm our business. 

In addition, our PRC operating entities store
a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the
operation of our facilities. While our PRC operating entities have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells,
there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would
likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor s EVs and pure electric
off-road vehicles, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our EV products. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our
brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

Compliance with environmental regulations
can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages
and fines. 

The business operations of our PRC operating entities
generate noise, waste water, gaseous byproduct and other industrial waste. Our PRC operating entities are required to comply with all
national and local regulations regarding the protection of the environment. Our PRC operating entities are in compliance with current
environmental protection requirements and have all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. However, if more stringent
regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new regulations could be substantial. Additionally, if our PRC
operating entities fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, they may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend
production or cease operations. Any failure by our PRC operating entities to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the unauthorized
discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions to our business
operations. Certain laws, ordinances and regulations could limit our ability to develop, use, or sell our products. 

Our high concentration of sales to relatively
few customers may result in significant impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operating
subsidiaries major customers (above 10 of the total revenue), in the aggregate, accounted for 26 and 29 , respectively, of their
sales. Due to the concentration of sales to relatively few customers, loss of one or more of these customers will have relatively high
impact on their operational results. 

Our business is subject to the risk of supplier
concentrations. 

Our PRC operating entities depend on a limited
number of suppliers for the sourcing of major components and parts and principal raw materials. For the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, the major suppliers (above 10 of the total purchases) of our operating subsidiaries accounted for 22 and 50 of their purchases,
respectively. As a result of this concentration in our supply chain, our operating subsidiaries business and operations would be
negatively affected if any of their key suppliers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability
or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of these suppliers, or a significant adverse change in our relationship
with any of these suppliers, could result in lost revenue, added costs and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer
relationships. Disputes with significant suppliers, logistics service providers or independent distributors, including disputes regarding
pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial
results. In addition, concentration in our supply chain can exacerbate our exposure to risks associated with the termination by key suppliers
of our distribution agreements or any adverse change in the terms of such agreements, which could have a negative impact on our revenues
and profitability. 

20 

Our facilities or operations could be damaged
or adversely affected as a result of disasters, epidemics or other unpredictable events. 

The Company s headquarters and facilities
are located in several cities in China such as Jinhua, Yongkang and Haikou. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes,
wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks
down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production
and shipment of our products. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in China,
and failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events
if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results. These could include port closures and other restrictions resulting
from the outbreak; constrained global supply, which may cause the negative impact on our sale of off-road vehicles to the U.S.; disruptions
or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities
of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers. Any disruption or delay of our operation and those of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers
would adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population
could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of China and many other countries,
resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and we may incur expenses relating to such damages, which
could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Our EVs and pure electric off-road
vehicles may not perform in line with customer expectations. 

Our EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles may
not perform in line with customers expectations. For example, our vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of other vehicles
in the market, and may not be as easy and convenient to repair as other vehicles in the market. Any product defects or any other failure
of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product
recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 

In addition, the range of our vehicles on a single
charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns as well as other factors. For example, a customer s
use of his or her EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles as well as the frequency with which he or she charges the battery can result
in additional deterioration of the battery s ability to hold a charge. 

Furthermore, our vehicles may contain defects
in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. While we have performed extensive
internal testing on our vehicles software and hardware systems, we have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term
performance of our systems and vehicles. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles
prior to their sale to consumers. If any of our vehicles fail to perform as expected, we may need to delay deliveries, initiate product
recalls and provide servicing or updates under warranty at our expense, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and
could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system
of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential
shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for
us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on our internal controls over financial
reporting in their annual reports. 

Although we continue to maintain and improve our
internal control procedures, we cannot provide assurance that we will not fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment
on an ongoing basis, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a material adverse effect
on the price of our common stock. 

21 

Risks Related to Doing Business in China 

Substantial uncertainties and restrictions
on the political and economic policies of the PRC government, PRC laws and regulations which can change quickly with little advance notice,
and Chinese government s tendency to intervene or influence your operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings
conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be
able to conduct in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition; may restrict the level of legal
protections to foreign investors and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless; 

Kandi Technologies business operations
conducted through our PRC operating entities may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the PRC. Recently,
the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance
notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity
reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. The Chinese government exerts substantial influence and control over
the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. Our PRC operating entities ability to operate in China may be adversely
affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing
reform policies which have adversely affected China-based operating companies whose securities are listed in the United States, with significant
policies changes being made from time to time without notice. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application
of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance
of our contractual arrangements. Only after 1979 did the Chinese government begin to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws that regulate
economic affairs in general, deal with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation
and trade, as well as encourage foreign investment in China. Although the influence of the law has been increasing, China has not developed
a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities
in China. Also, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published cases and their
lack of force as precedents, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws
and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. In addition, there have been constant
changes and amendments of laws and regulations over the past 30 years in order to keep up with the rapidly changing society and economy
in China. Because government agencies and courts provide interpretations of laws and regulations and decide contractual disputes and issues,
their inexperience in adjudicating new business and new polices or regulations in certain less developed areas causes uncertainty and
may affect our operating entities business. Consequently, we cannot predict the future direction of Chinese legislative activities
with respect to either businesses with foreign investment or the effectiveness on enforcement of laws and regulations in China. The uncertainties,
including new laws and regulations and changes of existing laws, as well as judicial interpretation by inexperienced officials in the
agencies and courts in certain areas, may cause possible problems to foreign investors. Although the PRC government has been pursuing
economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth
in the PRC through the allocation of resources, controlling payments of foreign currency, setting monetary policy and imposing policies
that impact particular industries in different ways. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will continue to pursue policies favoring
a market oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership,
social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC. The Chinese government
may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment
in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the securities being offered. Any
adverse changes in Chinese laws and regulations and the Chinese government s significant oversight and discretion over the conduct
of our business could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause
the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

Our current corporate structure and business
operations and the market price of our common stock may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law. 

Kandi Technologies is a holding company incorporated
in Delaware, with no material operations of its own, a substantial majority of the operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries
established in PRC and U.S. We are classified as a foreign enterprise under PRC laws and regulations, and our wholly foreign-owned enterprises
in the PRC will be foreign-invested enterprises. 

22 

On March 15, 2019 and December 26, 2019,
the National People s Congress, China s national legislative body (the NPC approved the Foreign Investment
Law, and the PRC State Council approved the Implementation Rules of the Foreign Investment Law, respectively, both came into effect on
January 1, 2020. Since they are relatively new, uncertainties exist in relation to their interpretation. The Foreign Investment Law
grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries
specified as either restricted or prohibited from foreign investment in the Negative List. The Foreign Investment
Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in restricted or prohibited industries will require
market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. In accordance with the Foreign Investment Law, the
State Council promulgated and approved in 2021 a list of special administrative measures for market access of foreign investments, or
the Negative List. Pursuant to the Negative List, the development, manufacture and sale of EVs does not fall within the prohibited 
or restricted category. However, since the Negative List has been adjusted and updated almost on an annual basis in the
recent years, we cannot assure you that the aforementioned business of EV manufacturing and sales will continuously be beyond the
 prohibited category. If any of our subsidiaries is restricted or prohibited from foreign investment
under the Negative List effective at the time, we may be deemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, may be
required to restructure our business operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operation and the market
price of our ordinary shares. 

Adverse regulatory developments in China
may subject us to additional regulatory review, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC
in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like
us with China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements. 

The recent regulatory developments in China, in
particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to additional regulatory review in
China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition, we may be subject to industry-wide regulations
that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of restricting the scope of our operations in China, or
causing the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations
in response to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can
be completed in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner or at all. 

On July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory
developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek
additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies before their registration statements will
be declared effective. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a statement that it had taken note of the
new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in
China, and that both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. We cannot guarantee that we will
not be subject to tightened regulatory review and we could be exposed to government interference in China. 

Compliance with China s new Data Security
Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines
relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially
affect our business. 

China has implemented or will implement rules
and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China s new Data Security Law took effect in September
2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification and hierarchical
protection system for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to
foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. 

Additionally, China s Cyber Security Law
requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security
of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt a multi-level protection
scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is
free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the
MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and
network systems to determine the level to which the entity s information and network systems belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the
highest Level 5 pursuant to a series of national standards on the grading and implementation of the classified protection of cyber security.
The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level
2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval.

Recently, the Cyberspace Administration of China
has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities exchanges,
for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According to
the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity
Review, which are aimed at preventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public interests. 
On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding
the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend
to list their securities in a foreign country. 

It is unclear at the present time how widespread
the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on our business. China s
regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting
from the U.S. stock market. 

Also, on August 20, 2021, the National People s
Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which has been implemented on November 1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive
set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance
obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of
personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or
analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical information infrastructure operators and
personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators
are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered
by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains proposals for significant fines
for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5 of annual revenues from the prior year. 

Interpretation, application and enforcement of
these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments
to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law could significantly
increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing
certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts
to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is
possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law,
the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other
obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access,
use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of
failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with us or
result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation, any
of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are not
subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and
the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging
in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market. 

Recent greater oversight by the CAC over
data security, particularly for companies seeking to list on a foreign exchange, could adversely impact our business and our offering. 

On December 28, 2021, the CAC and other relevant
PRC governmental authorities jointly promulgated the the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (the Measures ), which took effect
on February 15, 2022. The Measures provide that net platform operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect
national security must be subject to cybersecurity review by the Cybersecurity Review Office of the PRC. According to the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, a cybersecurity review assesses potential national security risks that may be brought about by any procurement, data
processing, or overseas listing. The Measures require that an online platform operator which possesses the personal information of at
least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review by the CAC if it intends to be listed in foreign countries. 

24 

On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Regulations
on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) (the Draft Regulation ), which provides that data processing operators
engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security must be subject to network data security review by
the relevant Cyberspace Administration of the PRC. According to the Draft Regulation, data processing operators who possess personal
data of at least one million users or collect data that affects or may affect national security must be subject to network data security
review by the relevant Cyberspace Administration of the PRC. The deadline for public comments on the Draft Regulation was December 13,
2021. 

As advised by our PRC Counsel, Zhejiang Lizhou
(Jinhua) Law Firm, as of the date of this report, (i) the Company does not hold personal information of over one million users; (ii) the
Company and its subsidiaries have not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it file for a cybersecurity
review; and (iii) the Company and its subsidiaries have never disclosed any customer or supplier information within China (except when
requested by related parties, the company and its subsidiaries tailor their customer or supplier information disclosures to the narrowest
possible scope), therefore, the Company believes it is not required to pass cybersecurity review of CAC. Further, as of the date of this
report, Kandi Technologies and its subsidiaries 1) did not collect any data that will or may negatively influence PRC s national
security; and 2) strictly follow the relevant PRC laws and regulations. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Measures and
the Draft Regulation will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws,
regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Measures and the Draft Regulation. If any such new laws,
regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply
and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review
and network data security review in the future. During such reviews, we may be required to suspend our operation or experience other disruptions
to our operations. Cybersecurity review and network data security review could also result in negative publicity with respect to our Company
and diversion of our managerial and financial resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions,
and results of operations. 

The approval of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission CSRC may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and,
if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of
Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, require
an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies
or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle s securities
on an overseas stock exchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials
required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings. However, substantial uncertainty
remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Currently, there is no consensus
among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement. 

Based on our understanding of the Chinese laws
and regulations in effect at the time of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of
an offering in a foreseeable future and the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq. However, there remains some uncertainty
as to how the M A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and our belief is subject to any
new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M A Rules or overseas
offering approval. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as
we do.

Recently, the General Office of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down
on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The
Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision
over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will
be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection
requirements and similar matters. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for
Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which required that, among others, in addition to operator of critical information infrastructure ,
any data processor controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock
exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the national
security risks of the relevant activities. We do not believe we are among the operator of critical information infrastructure 
or data processor as mentioned above. Based on the above and our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations currently
in effect as of the date of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC or the CAC for the approval of a
future offering and the listing and trading of our securities on the Nasdaq. However, the revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity
Review is in the process of being formulated and the Opinions remain unclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and implemented by
the relevant PRC governmental authorities. Thus, it is still uncertain how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing
in general and whether we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals. Furthermore, if the CSRC or other regulatory agencies
later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for future offering and any follow-on offering, we
may be unable to obtain such approvals which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer
securities to our investors. For instance, in the event that the CSRC approval or any regulatory approval is required for a future offering,
or if the CSRC or any other PRC government authorities promulgates any new laws, rules or regulations or any interpretation or implements
rules before our listing that would require us to obtain the CSRC or any other governmental approval for a future offering, we may face
sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies if we fail to seek CSRC approval for such future offering. These sanctions may
include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions
on the repatriation of the proceeds from a future offering into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance
of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies
may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt a future offering before the settlement and delivery of the
securities that we offer. Consequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement
and delivery of the securities we offer, you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur. Any uncertainties
or negative publicity regarding such approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete any follow-on
offering of our securities or the market for and market price of our common stock. 

On December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or
the CSRC , published draft regulations (the Draft Rules on domestic enterprises issuing securities and being
listed overseas. The Draft Rules lay out specific filing requirements for overseas listing and offering by PRC domestic companies and
include unified regulation management and strengthening regulatory coordination. On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial
Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures ), which will
take effect on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures supersede the Draft Rules and clarified and emphasized several aspects, which include
but are not limited to: (1) criteria to determine whether an issuer will be required to go through the filing procedures under the Trial
Measures; (2) exemptions from immediate filing requirements for issuers including those that have already been listed or registered but
not yet listed in foreign securities markets, including U.S. markets, prior to the effective date of the Trial Measures; (3) a negative
list of types of issuers banned from listing or offering overseas, such as issuers whose affiliates have been recently convicted of bribery
and corruption; (4) issuers compliance with web security, data security, and other national security laws and regulations; (5)
issuers filing and reporting obligations, such as obligation to file with the CSRC after it submits an application for initial
public offering to overseas regulators, and obligation after offering or listing overseas to report to the CSRC material events including
change of control or voluntary or forced delisting of the issuer; and (6) the CSRC s authority to fine both issuers and their shareholders
for failure to comply with the Trial Measures, including failure to comply with filing obligations or committing fraud and misrepresentation.
Because we are already publicly listed in the U.S., the Trial Measures do not impose additional regulatory burden on us beyond the obligation
to report to the CSRC any future offerings of our securities, or material events such as a change of control or delisting. As the Trial
Measures are newly issued, there remains uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted or implemented. Therefore, there is uncertainty
that if we are subject to such filing requirements under the Trial Measures, we will be able to get clearance from the CSRC in a timely
fashion.

It may be difficult for U.S. regulators,
such as the Department of Justice, the SEC, and other authorities, to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China. 

Shareholder claims or regulatory investigation
that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China,
there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigations initiated
outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities
of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with regulatory authorities in
the Unities States-including the SEC and the Department of Justice-may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation
mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities
regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the PRC territory. Currently the management
of the Company understand that the Article 177 does not apply to the Company and will not negatively influence the authorities, such as
the SEC, or the Department of Justice, to conduct investigation or collect evidence towards us. However, since the PRC Securities Law
is relatively new and detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, we cannot assure
you that the PRC legislative authority will have the same understanding as us and the inability for an overseas securities regulator to
directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase the difficulties you face in protecting
your interests. 

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, or the HFCAA, and the related regulations continue to evolve. Further implementations and interpretations of or amendments to the
HFCAA or the related regulations, or a PCAOB determination of its lack of sufficient access to inspect our auditor, might pose regulatory
risks to and impose restrictions on us because of our operations in mainland China. 

On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the HFCAA requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a
foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the Company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection.
If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the Company s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited
to trade on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. On December 18, 2020, the HFCAA was signed
into law. The HFCAA has since then been subject to amendments by the U.S. Congress and interpretations and rulemaking by the SEC. 

On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act AHFCAA ), which proposes to reduce the period of time for foreign companies to
comply with PCAOB audits from three to two consecutive years, thus reducing the time period before the securities of such foreign companies
may be prohibited from trading or delisted. On December 29, 2022, the AHFCAA was signed into law. 

On December 16, 2021, PCAOB announced the PCAOB
HFCAA determinations relating to the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China of the PRC or Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one
or more authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China made it more difficult
to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors
outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing and potential investors in issuers operating in
China to lose confidence in such issuers procedures and reported financial information and the quality of financial statements. 

Our auditor, Kreit Chiu CPA LLP, the independent
registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this report, as an auditor of companies that are
traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the
PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess our auditor s compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is
headquartered in New York, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the last inspection in 2020. Our auditor
is not among the firms listed on the PCAOB Determination List issued in December 2021. 

27 

On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced and signed
a Statement of Protocol (the Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the
People s Republic of China (together, the PRC Authorities ). The Protocol provides the PCAOB with: (1) sole discretion
to select the firms, audit engagements and potential violations it inspects and investigates, without any involvement of Chinese authorities;
(2) procedures for PCAOB inspectors and investigators to view complete audit work papers with all information included and for the PCAOB
to retain information as needed; (3) direct access to interview and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB
inspects or investigates. 

On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced in its
2022 HFCAA Determination Report (the 2022 Report its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to
inspect and investigate audit firms in the People s Republic of China (PRC), and the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations
to the contrary. According to the 2022 Report, this determination was reached after the PCAOB had thoroughly tested compliance with every
aspect of the Protocol necessary to determine complete access, including on-site inspections and investigations in a manner fully consistent
with the PCAOB s methodology and approach in the U.S. and globally. According to the 2022 Report, the PRC Authorities had fully
assisted and cooperated with the PCAOB in carrying out the inspections and investigations according to the Protocol, and have agreed to
continue to assist the PCAOB s investigations and inspections in the future. The PCAOB may reassess its determinations and issue
new determinations consistent with the HFCAA at any time. 

While the HFCAA and AHFCAA are not currently applicable
to the Company because the Company s current auditors are subject to PCAOB review, if this changes in the future for any reason,
the Company may be subject to the HFCAA and AHFCAA. The implications of this regulation if the Company were to become subject to it are
uncertain. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our common stock to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities
could be delisted or prohibited from being traded on Nasdaq earlier than would be required by the HFCAA and AHFCAA. If our common stock
is unable to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase
the common stock when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact
on the price of the common stock. 

The economy of China had experienced unprecedented
growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our
financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

The rapid growth of the Chinese economy had historically
resulted in widespread growth opportunities for industries across China. This growth has slowed in the recent years. As a result of the
global financial crisis due to the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, enterprises are becoming more and more difficult to gain
comparable access to the same amounts of capital available in past years, which may have an adverse effect on the business climate and
growth of private enterprises in China, including us. An economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on our sales and may increase
our costs. Further, if economic growth continues to slow, and if, in conjunction, inflation continues unchecked, our costs would be likely
to increase, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to increase our prices to an extent that would offset the increase in
our expenses. 

In addition, a tightened labor markets in our
geographic region may result in fewer qualified applicants for job openings in our facilities. Further, higher wages, related labor costs
and other increasing cost trends may negatively impact our results. 

Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese
legal system could have a material adverse effect on us and may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors. 

China s legal system is based on statutory
law. Unlike the common law system, statutory law is based primarily on written statutes. Previous court decisions may be cited as persuasive
authority but do not have a binding effect. Since 1979, the Chinese government has been promulgating and amending laws and regulations
regarding economic matters, such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However,
since these laws and regulations are relatively new, and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretation of many
laws, regulations and rules is not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may
limit legal protections available to us. 

28 

In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted
and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management s attention. The legal system in China cannot provide
investors with the same level of protection as in the U.S. The Company is governed by laws and regulations generally applicable to local
enterprises in China. Many of these laws and regulations were recently introduced and remain experimental in nature and subject to changes
and refinements. Interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the existing laws and regulations can be uncertain and unpredictable
and therefore may restrict the legal protections available to foreign investors. 

Changes in currency conversion policies
in China may have a material adverse effect on us. 

Renminbi RMB is still not a freely
exchangeable currency. Since 1998, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China has promulgated a series of circulars and rules
in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under Chinese entity s current account items, and has imposed strict
requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on
the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors. 

This may complicate foreign exchange payments
to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans, the
creation of foreign security, and the borrowing of RMB under guarantees in foreign currencies. Moreover, the value of RMB may become subject
to supply and demand, which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments. Any fluctuations in the exchange
rate of RMB could have an adverse effect on the operational and financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries in China. 

Restrictions on currency exchange may limit
our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively. 

Some of our revenue is denominated in Renminbi.
As a result, restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any business activities
we may have outside China in the future or to make dividend payments to our shareholders in U.S. dollars. Under current PRC laws and regulations,
Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend
distributions. However, Renminbi is not freely convertible for direct investment or loans or investments in securities outside China,
unless such use is approved by SAFE. For example, foreign exchange transactions under our subsidiary s capital account, including
principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign exchange controls and
the approval requirement of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency for capital expenditures.
To the extent cash and/or assets in the business is in the PRC or a PRC entity, the funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations
or for other use outside of the PRC due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or
our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets. And the Chinese government is further strengthening the control
of foreign exchange, we will not be able to change the Chinese government s decision in our own power. 

Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely
affect our business and the value of our securities. 

The value of our common stock will be indirectly
affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales
may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate
between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In addition, appreciation
or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without
giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. 

Investors may experience difficulties in
effecting service of legal process, enforcing judgements or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us
or our management. 

We, through our PRC operating entities, conduct
substantially all of our operations in China and almost all of our assets are located in China. In addition, almost all of our senior
executive officers reside in China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process on our senior executive officers
within the United States or elsewhere outside China, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable
state securities laws. Moreover, our Chinese counsel has advised us that China does not have treaties with the United States or many other
countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court orders and final judgments. 

From time to time, Kandi is involved in several
litigations that we believe to be without merit, some have been dismissed, while others are still pending. We believe we can successfully
defend ourselves in such litigations. Moreover, if finally judgements are made against us, certain plaintiffs may face substantial difficulties
in executing such judgement since China does not have treaties with the United States and certain other countries providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of court orders and final judgments.

Vehicles to and sale in the United States 

The enactment of Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022 may influence the value of our securities. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal
1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock or shares by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations
and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself,
not its shareholders from whom shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares
repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted
to net the fair market value of certain new stock or share issuances against the fair market value of stock or share repurchases during
the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations
and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur
after December 31, 2022. As the Company does not plan to have any repurchases of the Company s stock, we currently do not anticipate
this provision of the IR Act to have any material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The real impact
of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.

harmed by competitors preemptively filing legitimate and illegitimate patents, which could create significant barriers for our business
by preventing us from adequately protecting our intellectual property. 

Multinational automobile companies usually obtain
patent portfolios consisting of basic patents and peripheral patents on improvements and related technologies, thereby creating patent
barriers in the industry. At the same time, certain multinational automobile companies also maliciously apply for patents, in order to
obtain an unlawful competitive advantage or to directly receive invalid rights and use patents as weapons in litigation. New energy vehicles
are emerging products in worldwide markets in recent years, while relevant and related patents in the industry are still in force. Kandi
may be seriously adversely affected by intellectual property rights barriers through participation in the competitive international automobile
market. Therefore, Kandi faces risks of patent barriers and intellectual property litigation in the future. 

Failures in our U.S. business may present
a risk of significant losses to our business. 

Our automobile product export and overseas operations
sections involve import and export currency exchange, insurance, ocean transportation, customs clearance and various other logistical
procedures. A loss of trust in any part of the chain can lead to the failure of transactions, which in turn causes huge losses to our
enterprise. In the future, the Company will expand its overseas market. Any insufficient assessment of the capital strength and commercial
credit of its partners, or any fraud in risk prevention and risk control systems may cause economic losses for the Company due to its
business partners breach of contract or even fraud. In short, shipping Kandi electric vehicles and products to the United States
may have risks in the U.S. operation, and import and export trade process. 

The United States has strict environmental
laws and regulations which may cause us to expend significant sums to comply with such laws and regulations. 

The United States and other developed countries
have strong awareness of environmental protection and product safety regulations. The penalties for violating environmental laws in such
countries are extremely high. Developed countries have mature and highly saturated automobile markets. Costs associated with maintaining
controls over atmospheric emissions, harmful toxic substances, and products safety are getting higher in an accelerated manner. The process
for a company to obtain the applicable certifications is time-consuming, complicated and expensive. Kandi will also face the adverse impact
of compliance with policy and regulatory standards in the United States. Thus, Kandi may face the risk of not being able to sustain its
business in accordance with US and state environmental protection and product safety policies and regulations. 

30 

Our short-term financial performance may
suffer due to our investment in expanding our presence and sales in the United States. 

Chinese auto products have market competition
disadvantages in terms of technology content, product structure, product quality and brand influence. It is difficult to reverse the sentiment
of low quality and low price that has followed Chinese automobiles for a long time, resulting in weakened bargaining power
for Chinese auto companies and generally low gross profit margins. Kandi is expanding into the US market and rely on overseas distributors
to establish a marketing network and after-sales service guarantee system. All actions require the Company to invest a certain amount
of resources. Additionally electric vehicle sales may face a slow growth period. In a certain period of time, the growth of operating
income lags behind the increase in sales inputs. At the same time, the Company cannot predict the direct economic loss caused by an unsatisfactory
market expansion caused by the adverse factors of market competition. Cash flows for Kandi and SC Autosports may be significantly adversely
affected by large investments and small revenues in the short term. Therefore, there may be a risk that the short-term financial performance
indicators will fall due to factors such as the expansion of resources in overseas markets. 

Lack of authorized dealer and absence of
after-sales maintenance may negatively affect our business and sales in U.S. 

In U.S. market, without authorized dealers, the
delivery of EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles may be delayed. Hence customers may delay, reduce or cancel the purchase orders of
our EVs and pure electric off-road vehicles, and our business operations may be adversely affected. At the same time, in the absence of
after-sales maintenance by the dealers, not only the cost and complexity of maintenance will be increased, it will also affect customers 
access to warranty and other after-sales service support, which may then weaken customers confidence in our brand, and we may even
encounter potential lawsuits due to lack of support to the customers. This can affect our brand and business, and bring an adverse impact
to the financial condition and operating performance of the Company. 

Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities 

Our stock price may be volatile, which may
result in losses for our shareholders. 

The stock markets have experienced significant
price and trading volume fluctuations. Although our stock has been trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since January 2, 2014, the
trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the following,
some of which are beyond our control: 

variations in our operating results; 

changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; 

changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry; 

additions or departures of key personnel; or 

general sentiment on China-based companies securities. 

These fluctuations, as well as general economic
and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

31 

Mr. Hu, our Chairman of our Board, is the
beneficial owner of a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which may enable Mr. Hu to exert significant influence on corporate
actions. 

Excelvantage Group Limited Excelvantage controls approximately
17.28 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022. Hu Xiaoming, the Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors,
is the sole stockholder of Excelvantage. Together with the shares held through Excelvantage, Mr. Hu controls 19.38 of our outstanding
shares of common stock, which could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, including the election
of our directors and other corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover
or other change in control, even if these actions would benefit our other shareholders and the Company. This control could adversely affect
the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock. 

Our ability to distribute dividends is restricted
by PRC Company Law and Foreign Investment Law 

According to the PRC Company Law and Foreign Investment
Law, our PRC subsidiary, as a foreign-invested enterprise, or FIE, we may only pay dividends out of their accumulated profit, if any,
as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition we are required to draw 10 of its after-tax profits
each year, if any, to fund a common reserve, which may stop drawing its after-tax profits if the aggregate balance of the common reserve
has already accounted for over 50 of its registered capital. The reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends. A PRC company
is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Our ability to distribute dividends
may be restricted because of the above-mentioned regulations. We may even cannot distribute dividends if we are suffering loss in certain
fiscal year in the future. 

We do not anticipate paying cash dividends
to our common shareholders. 

We presently do not anticipate that we will pay
dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would
be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common
stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board. We presently intend to retain all earnings in order to implement our business
plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future. 

The limitation of monetary liability against
our directors, officers and employees under Delaware Law and the existence of statutory indemnification rights of our directors, officers
and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees. 

Our certificate of incorporation does not contain
any specific provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the Company or shareholders; however, we are
prepared to indemnify our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Delaware law. We may also have included contractual indemnification
obligations in our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the Company incurring
substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against its directors and officers, which we may be unable to
recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage the Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for
breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors
and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and shareholders. 

We may require additional capital, and the
sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. 

In the future, we may require additional cash
resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including investments or acquisitions that we may decide to
pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or
obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
We cannot assure investors that financing will be available, if at all, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. 

32 

Our business is subject to changing regulations
related to corporate governance and public disclosure that may increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. 

Because our common stock is publicly traded, we
are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors
and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in
response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely
to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating
activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in
many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory
and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated
by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. 

Techniques employed by manipulative short
sellers in Chinese small cap stocks may drive down the market price of our common stock. 

Short selling is the practice of selling securities
that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities
back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the
sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than
it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short
sellers (sometimes known as disclosed shorts publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions or reports regarding
the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling
a stock short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. 

Short seller publications are not regulated by
any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S. and are not subject to the certification requirements
imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation AC (Regulation Analyst Certification) and, accordingly, the opinions they
express may be based on distortions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in
publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short
sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports. 

While we intend to strongly defend our public
filings against any such short seller attack, often times we are constrained, either by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state
law (often called Anti-SLAPP statutes ), or issues of commercial confidentiality, in the manner in which we can proceed against
the relevant short seller. You should be aware that in light of the relative freedom to operate that such persons enjoy - oftentimes blogging
from outside the U.S. with little or no assets or identity requirements - should we be targeted for such an attack, our stock will likely
suffer from a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in market price should the rumors created not be dismissed by market participants.

All land in China is owned by the government and
cannot be sold or transferred by or to any individual or private entity. Instead, the government grants or allocates landholders land
use rights. There are four methods to acquire land use rights: 

grant of the right to use land; 

assignment of the right to use land; 

lease of the right to use land; or 

allocated land use rights. 

In comparison with the western common law concepts,
granted land use rights are similar to life estates and allocated land use rights are in some ways similar to leaseholds. 

Granted land use rights are provided by the Chinese
government in exchange for a grant fee and carry the rights to pledge, mortgage, lease, and transfer during the term of the grant. Land
is granted for a fixed term, which is generally 70 years for residential use, 50 years for industrial use, and 40 years for commercial
or other use. The term is renewable in theory. Granted land must be used for the specific purpose for which it was granted. 

Allocated land use rights cannot be pledged, mortgaged,
leased, or transferred. They are generally provided by the government for an indefinite period (usually to state-owned entities) and can
be reclaimed by the government at any time. Allocated land use rights may be converted into granted land use rights upon the payment of
a grant fee to the government.

Haikou City, Hainan 

In December 2015, the Company signed an investment
contract with Haikou State High Technology Industry Development Zone to build the EV production facility in Haikou City for the capacity
of an annual production of 100,000 EV products. The Hainan facility s main project including manufacturing plant and office, main
manufacturing equipment. The facilities has been completed and the project completion acceptance is being processed. 

Project completion acceptance means the process
that the responsible construction unit, contractor and inspection and acceptance committee carry out their inspection and appraisal for
the overall project after the project is completed and qualified for trial production. The inspection and appraisal are based on design
documents, construction acceptance rules and quality inspection standards approved, in accordance with related procedures and formalities.
Project completion acceptance is the last step in the whole process of a project construction, and is also necessary before formal production. 

Acceptance process mainly includes 1) quality
acceptance of buildings organized by government construction regulators; 2) acceptance of fire safety facilities; 3) acceptance of environmental
protection technology; and 4) trial production acceptance of production facilities. 

As of the date of this report, pre-acceptance
of the main project of quality supervision, as part of the Project Quality Acceptance of buildings, was completed in March 2022. Pre-acceptance
of fire protection has been carried out in March 2022. The Company has completed the improvement following the fire protection expert s
suggestions, has completed the remediation and has received the acceptance. Currently the Company is waiting for the acceptance report.
Environmental Protection Acceptance has been completed. The processing equipment and assembly lines have passed the joint debugging and
testing, and related acceptance has been completed. 

According to the progress of acceptance, the Company
is applying formal acceptance to related government authorities. The expected completion time cannot be determined at present. 

At present, the relevant department of the government
verbally allows small-scale production prior to the completion of acceptance process, so Hainan factory is producing its products in the
form of trial production, waiting for the final completion acceptance of the project. However, during the period of completion acceptance,
if the local government regulatory authorities no longer allow us to produce, or we are required to stop production, we may be subject
to a fine less than RMB 1 million, and our revenue may be adversely affected. Other than that, the Company has no any other risks associated
with the Hainan factory.

Overview 

Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. Kandi Technologies is a Delaware holding company, which is trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a holding company with no material operations
of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries established in the People s
Republic of China, or the PRC, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies Group, Co. Ltd. Zhejiang Kandi Technologies and U.S.
wholly-owned subsidiaries SC Autosports, LLC SC Autosports and their subsidiaries. 

Thanks to our business strategy adjustment, we
made considerable progress in electric off-road vehicles, despite the resurgences of COVID-19 in 2022, which has been causing frequent
lockdowns in many cities and severe disruption of supply chain. Now with the global trend of fuel to electrification of
off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious, we have successfully developed electric crossover golf carts and put them on the market
in batches, which have been favored by users. Next, we will successively launch various electric off-road vehicles, including electric
crossover golf carts and electric UTVs. With the successively introduction of new products, we are confident to achieve sustained growth
in the field of the pure electric off-road vehicles. As for our EV business, due to the fact that the Chinese EV market has not entered
a healthy and orderly development stage, currently the Company will continue to operate in small-scale, and join back as appropriate when
the EV market of China entered a healthy and orderly development stage. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized total revenue of
 117,813,049 as compared to 91,486,384 for the same period of 2021, an increase of 26,326,665 or 28.8 . For the year ended December
31, 2022, we recorded 19,517,726 of gross profit, an increase of 20.1 from the same period of 2021. Gross margin for the year ended
December 31, 2022, was 16.6 , compared to 17.8 for the same period of 2021. We recorded a net loss of 12,851,024 for the year ended
December 31, 2022, compared to a net income of 22,863,798 in the same period of 2021, a decrease of 35,714,822 or 156.2 .

Critical Accounting Policies and Related Estimates
That Could Have a Material Effect on Our Consolidated Financial Statements 

This section should be read together with the
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the attached consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 

Estimates affecting accounts receivable
and inventories 

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reporting of assets and liabilities (and contingent assets
and liabilities). These estimates are particularly significant where they affect the reported net realizable value of our accounts receivable
and inventories. 

Accounts receivable are recognized and carried
at net realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for periods in which the Company determines a loss is probable,
based on its assessment of specific factors, such as troubled collections, historical experience, accounts aging, ongoing business relations
and other factors. Accounts are written off after exhaustive collection efforts. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written
off, they are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within the operating expenses line item. If accounts receivable previously
written off is recovered in a later period or when facts subsequently become available to indicate that the amount provided as an allowance
for doubtful accounts was incorrect, an adjustment is made to restate allowance for doubtful accounts. 

As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
credit terms with the Company s customers were typically 60 to 180 days after delivery. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
had a 2,285,386 and 3,053,277 allowance for doubtful accounts, as per the Company management s judgment based on their best knowledge.
The Company conducts quarterly assessments of the state of the Company s outstanding receivables and reserves any allowance for
doubtful accounts if it becomes necessary. 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
net realizable value (market value). The cost of raw materials is determined on the basis of weighted average. The cost of finished goods
is determined on the basis of weighted average and comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead.
Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred for completion.
Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired
balances. 

46 

Although we believe that there is little likelihood
that actual results will differ materially from our current estimates, if customer demands for our products decreases significantly in
the near future, or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates in the near future, we could realize significant write downs
for slow-moving inventories or uncollectible accounts receivable. 

Policy affecting recognition of revenue 

Our revenue recognition policy plays a key role
in our consolidated financial statements. 

The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers with a date of the initial application of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The impact
of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on the Company s consolidated financial statements is not material. 

The Company recognizes revenue when goods or services
are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
In determining when and how revenue is recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis:
(i) identification of contract with customer (ii) determination of performance obligations (iii) measurement of the transaction
price (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as)
the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

The Company generates revenue through EV parts
and off-road vehicles. The revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control
over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually
at the time of delivery, at the net sales price (transaction price). Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers,
which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Shipping and handling costs for product shipments occur prior to the customer
obtaining control of the goods are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than separate performance obligations and recorded as sales
and marketing expenses. 

Estimate affecting impairment of long-lived
assets 

The Company periodically evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances warrant
such a review, pursuant to the guidelines established in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144 (now
known as ASC 360 ). The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash
flow from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset. Fair market value is determined primarily using
the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are
determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for disposal costs. 

The Company recognized impairment loss of 2,697,521
and nil for finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Estimate affecting impairment of goodwill 

The Company allocates goodwill from business combinations
to reporting units based on the expectation that the reporting unit is to benefit from the business combination. The Company evaluates
its reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassigns goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could
include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition
of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 

47 

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires
judgments, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill
to reporting units, and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to
determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If the more likely than not threshold is met, the Company performs
a quantitative impairment test. 

The Company applies the reporting unit criteria in ASC 350-20 to the
components to determine if the reporting unit should be identified one level below the operating segment. Each component will be evaluated
to determine if: (a) it is a business (as defined in ASC 805), (b) discrete financial information is available and (c) the operating results
are regularly reviewed by the segment manager(s). If the components of a specific operating segment meet these criteria, they might be
deemed to be separate reporting units. However, if they have similar economic characteristics (which is a matter of judgment based on
individual facts and circumstances), these components must be aggregated into one reporting unit. There are three reporting units under
the goodwill impairment analysis, namely 1) SC Autosports, 2) Jinhua An Kao and Yongkang Scrou, and 3) Jiangxi Huiyi. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
performed goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level and recognized impairment loss of 642,665 and nil, respectively. 

Estimate affecting contingent consideration
liability 

The Company recorded contingent consideration
liability of the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration the Company currently expects to pay to the Jiangxi Huiyi 
former members upon the achievement of certain milestones. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with remaining
shares of restrictive common stock was estimated by using the Monte Carlo simulation method, which took into account all possible scenarios.
This fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy prescribed by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement
and Disclosures. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, the Company will re-measure this liability each reporting period
and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

As of December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, the Company s contingent consideration liability was 1,803,000 and 7,812,000, respectively. 

Policy affecting options, warrants and convertible notes 

Our stock option cost is recorded in accordance
with ASC 718 and ASC 505. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Binomial Tree Model. Our expected volatility assumption
is based on the historical volatility of our stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the option.
The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Stock option expense recognition is based on awards expected to vest. There were no estimated forfeitures. ASC standards require forfeitures
to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

48 

The stock-based option expenses for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1,231,566 and 0, respectively. There were no forfeitures estimated during the reporting period. 

Our warrant costs are recorded in liabilities
and equities, respectively, in accordance with ASC 480, ASC 505 and ASC 815. The fair value of a warrant, which is classified as a liability,
is estimated using the Binomial Tree model and the lattice valuation model. Our expected volatility assumption is based on the historical
volatility of our common stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the warrant. The risk-free interest
rate for the expected term of the warrant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement. Our warrants,
which are freestanding derivatives classified as liabilities on the balance sheet, are measured at fair value on each reporting date,
with decreases in fair value recognized in earnings and increases in fair values recognized in expenses. 

The fair value of equity-based warrants, which
is not considered derivatives under ASC 815, is estimated using the Binomial Tree model. Our expected volatility assumption is based on
the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the warrant.
The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 

In accordance with ASC 815, the conversion feature
of the convertible notes is separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument. On the date the
convertible notes are issued, the conversion feature is recorded as a liability at its fair value, and future decreases in fair value
are recognized in earnings while increases in fair values are recognized in expenses. We used the Binomial Tree option-pricing model to
obtain the fair value of the conversion feature. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our common
stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the conversion features. The risk-free interest rate
for the expected term of the conversion features is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement. 

U.S. Corporate Income Tax 

Based on Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB staff Q A Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), the FASB staff noted that
the Company must make an accounting policy election to either (1) recognize taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related
to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method or (2) factor such amount into the Company s
measure of its deferred taxes (the deferred method ). The Company elected to treat GILTI as a current-period expense when
incurred.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

Board of Directors and Shareholders 

Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December
31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited Kandi Technologies
Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission . 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Basis for Opinion 

Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. s management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity s financial statements and an opinion
on the entity s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Kandi
Technologies Group, Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

An entity s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 33,178,229
of Goodwill and 7,994,112 of Intangible Assets. As discussed in Notes 5 and 6, management assesses Goodwill and Intangible Assets for
impairment. Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves the use of forecasted revenues, expenses,
and capital expenditures. While the Company did engage an external valuation specialist, the valuation process is still highly subjective. 

Through this impairment assessment the Company
identified impairment of Goodwill of 642,665 and Intangible Assets impairment of 2,697,521, both related to the Jiangxi Huiyi subsidiary. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our procedures related to the impairment of Goodwill
and Intangible Assets at Jiangxi Huiyi include the following: (1) Tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the impairment analysis
including the internal controls over the development of assumptions used in the valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. (2) Tested
management s process of evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation models used to value the Goodwill and Intangible Assets. (3) Used
an independent valuation specialist to test valuation assumptions and methodology. (4) Assessed qualitative factors relevant to the Company
in order to determine if contradictory evidence exists. 

Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liability 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

As stated in Note 18, the Company acquired 100 
of the equity of Jiangxi Huiyi in October 2021. In addition to cash, the Company had the contingent obligation to pay up to 2,576,310
shares of its common stock over the following three-year period, payable at three milestone dates. The contingent consideration liability
was valued at 1,803,000 as of December 31, 2022. 

Key inputs to the valuation of the contingent
consideration liability include estimates of future revenue and expenses of Jiangxi Huiyi and estimates of the future stock price of the
Company. The valuation of the contingent consideration liability is established by external valuation specialists using the inputs noted
above and valuation methods followed in the valuation industry. While the Company used best estimates and engaged an external valuation
specialist, the Company s estimates are inherently uncertain and include significant judgment. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our procedures related to the valuation of the
contingent consideration liability related to the Jiangxi Huiyi acquisition include the following: (1) We tested the effectiveness of
internal controls over the valuation of contingent consideration liability including the internal controls over the development of assumptions
used in the valuation of the contingent consideration liability. (2) Tested management s process of evaluating the appropriateness of
the valuation models used to value the contingent consideration liability. (3) Used an independent valuation specialist to test valuation
assumptions and methodology. (4) Assessed qualitative factors relevant to the Company in order to determine if contradictory evidence
exists.

excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock or
shares by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations.
The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount
of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock or share issuances
against the fair market value of stock or share repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the
excise tax. Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance
of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. We currently do not anticipate this
provision of the IR Act to have any material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The real impact of
this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

The
Company s ICFR includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, so that no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues are detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, any current evaluation of controls cannot and should not be projected to future periods. 

Management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our system of ICFR as of December 31, 2022, the last day of our fiscal year of 2022.
This assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in 2013 (the 2013 COSO Framework and included an evaluation
of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies,
and our overall control environment. Based on management s evaluation under the 2013 COSO Framework, management concluded that
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022 based on those criteria. 

We
reviewed the results of management s assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm, Kreit Chiu CPA LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our ICFR as of December 31,
2022 as stated in their report which is attached to the auditors reports included under item 8 of this report. 

(c) Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Salary
and Incentive Compensation 

In
fiscal 2022, the primary components of our executive compensation programs were base salary and equity compensation. 

Salary 

We
use base salary to fairly and competitively compensate our executives, including the named executive officers, for the jobs we ask them
to perform. We view base salary as the most stable component of our executive compensation program, as this amount is not at risk. We
believe that the base salaries of our executives should be targeted at or above the median of base salaries for executives in similar
positions with similar responsibilities at comparable companies, consistent with our compensation philosophy. At the end of the year,
each executive s performance is evaluated by our Compensation Committee, which takes into account the individual s performance,
responsibilities of the position, adherence to our core values, experience, and external market conditions and practices. 

Incentive
Compensation 

We
believe it is a customary and competitive practice to include an equity-based element of compensation to the overall compensation package
for our named executive officers. We believe that a significant portion of the compensation paid to our named executive officers should
be performance -based and therefore at risk. Awards made are granted under the Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. Omnibus Long-Term Incentive
Plan (the Plan ). 

At
our 2008 annual shareholders meeting, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 2,600,000 options
have been granted under the Plan to the Company s employees and directors, of which 2,593,332 have been exercised, and 6,668 have
been forfeited. 

Pursuant
to Pre-Approved Award Grant Sub-Plan approved by the Board of Directors on December 30, 2013 and modified on July 25, 2014, if the Non-GAAP
net income in one year increases by 10 compared with the previous year, the total of 335,000 shares of the common stock from the Plan
(as disclosed in details in the next paragraph below) to be granted to certain employees (management of the Company is authorized to
determine list of employees and stock amount rewarded based on position adjustment of employees, performance and tenure of each employee
in that year) will be granted for that year; if the Non-GAAP net income in one year is less than the Non-GAAP net income in the previous
year, then no stock will be granted in that year; if the Non-GAAP net income in one year is 10 less than or 10 more than the Non-GAAP
net income in the previous year, then the stock grant amount will decrease or increase according to the Non-GAAP net income decrease
or increase percentage, but the total amount rewarded may not be over 200 . 

On
May 20, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase of 9,000,000 shares under the Plan at its annual meeting. The fair
value of each award granted under the Plan is determined based upon the closing price of the Company s stock on the date of the
grant. To the extent that the performance goal is not met and so no shares become due, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized
compensation cost during the applicable year is reversed. The number of shares of common stock granted under the Plan with respect to
fiscal 2014 was 670,000 shares based on the Non-GAAP Net Income of 2014. Compensation expense is recognized in General and Administrative
Expenses. On April 23, 2015 and June 7, 2015, the Company granted 550,000 shares and 120,000 shares, respectively, to the senior management
and key employee as year 2014 performance awards. On April 13, 2016, the Company granted 670,000 shares to the senior management and
key employee as year 2015 performance awards. In February 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to grant 246,900 shares
to a list of management members as compensation for their past services pursuant to Section 11 of the Company s 2008 plan. On September
26, 2016, the Board approved the termination of the previous Board s Pre-Approved Award Grant Sub-Plan under the 2008 Plan and
adopted a new plan to reduce the total number of shares of common stock of the stock award for select executives and key employees from
335,000 shares of common stock to 250,000 shares of common stock for each fiscal year and the other terms were as same as before. There
was no grant under the Board s Pre-Approved Award Grant Sub-Plan in the years of 2017 to 2021. 

55 

On
May 29, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the grant of stock options to purchase 4,900,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of 9.72 per share to the Company s senior executives. The stock options will vest
ratably over three years and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. As of December 31, 2022, 3,000,000 shares have been exercised,
and 1,000,000 shares have been forfeited. 

On
September 7, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the grant of stock options to purchase
5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, at an exercise price of 2.07 per share, to the Company s senior employees.
The stock options will vest ratably over three years on October 7, 2023, October 7, 2024 and October 7, 2025, respectively, and expire
on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
