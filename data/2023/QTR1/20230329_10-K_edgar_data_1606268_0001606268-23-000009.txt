Risk Factor Summary 
 Our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could be materially and adversely affected by, and the price of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could decline due to a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those summarized below. You should carefully consider the risk factors summarized below and described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 
 We are subject to commodity price risk. 
 Our financial results may be adversely impacted by weather conditions and changes in consumer demand. 
 Our risk management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and we may fail to fully or effectively hedge our commodity supply and price risk. 
 ESCOs face risks due to increased and rapidly changing regulations and increasing monetary fines by the state regulatory agencies. 
 The retail energy business is subject to a high level of federal, state and local regulations, which are subject to change. 
 Liability under the TCPA has increased significantly in recent years, and we face risks if we fail to comply. 
 We are, and in the future may become, involved in legal and regulatory proceedings and, as a result, may incur substantial costs. 
 Our business is dependent on retaining licenses in the markets in which we operate. 
 We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, which could cause us to fail to realize many of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. 
 Pursuant to our cash dividend policy, we distribute a significant portion of our cash through regular quarterly dividends, and our ability to grow and make acquisitions with cash on hand could be limited. 
 We may not be able to manage our growth successfully. 
 Our financial results fluctuate on a seasonal, quarterly and annual basis. 
 We may have difficulty retaining our existing customers or obtaining a sufficient number of new customers, due to competition and for other reasons. 
 Increased collateral requirements in connection with our supply activities may restrict our liquidity. 
 We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including COVID-19. 
 We are subject to direct credit risk for certain customers who may fail to pay their bills as they become due. 
 We depend on the accuracy of data in our information management systems, which subjects us to risks. 
 Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect our business. 
 Our success depends on key members of our management, the loss of whom could disrupt our business operations. 
 We rely on third party vendors for our customer acquisition verification, billing and transactions platform that exposes us to third party performance risk and other risk. 
 A large portion of our current customers are concentrated in a limited number of states, making us vulnerable to customer concentration risks. 
 Increases in state renewable portfolio standards or an increase in the cost of renewable energy credit and carbon offsets may adversely impact the price, availability and marketability of our products. 
 Our access to marketing channels may be contingent upon the viability of our telemarketing and door-to-door agreements with our vendors. 
 Our vendors may expose us to risks. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Capital Stock 
 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, decrease investor confidence in us, and reduce the value of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 6 

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or pay dividends. It could also expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry as well as impact our cash available for distribution. 
 Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on many factors, including the performance of our business, cash flows, RCE counts and the margins we receive, as well as restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility. 
 We are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our equity interest in Spark HoldCo, LLC ("Spark HoldCo") and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Spark HoldCo to pay dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are subordinated to our existing and future debt obligations. 
 Numerous factors may affect the trading price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 There may not be an active trading market for the Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, which may in turn reduce the market value and your ability to transfer or sell your shares of Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Our Founder holds a substantial majority of the voting power of our common stock. 
 Holders of Series A Preferred Stock have extremely limited voting rights. 
 We have engaged in transactions with our affiliates in the past and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders best interests. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 Future sales of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock in the public market could reduce the price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and may dilute your ownership in us. 
 We have issued preferred stock and may continue to do so, and the terms of such preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the fiduciary duties of one of our directors and certain of our affiliates and restricts the remedies available to our stockholders for actions taken by our Founder or certain of our affiliates that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock represent perpetual equity interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock on the date the Series A Preferred Stock becomes redeemable by us or on any particular date afterwards. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is not rated. 
 The Change of Control Conversion Right may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us. 
 Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the floating dividend rate of our Series A Preferred Stock. 
 A substantial increase in the Three-Month LIBOR Rate or an alternative rate could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Class A common stock. 
 We may not have sufficient earnings and profits in order for dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock to be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 You may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the Series A Preferred Stock even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution. 
 We are a controlled company under NASDAQ Global Select Market rules, and as such we are entitled to an exemption from certain corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ Global Market corporate governance requirements.

PART I. 

Items 1 2. Business and Properties 
 
 General 
 We are an independent retail energy services company founded in 1999 and are organized as a Delaware corporation that provides residential and commercial customers in competitive markets across the United States with an alternative choice for their natural gas and electricity. We purchase our electricity and natural gas supply from a variety of wholesale providers and bill our customers monthly for the delivery of electricity and natural gas based on their consumption at either a fixed or variable price. Electricity and natural gas are then distributed to our customers by local regulated utility companies through their existing infrastructure. 
 Our business consists of two operating segments: 
 Retail Electricity Segment . In this segment, we purchase electricity supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparties and ISOs and supply electricity to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price and variable-price contracts. 
 
 Retail Natural Gas Segment . In this segment, we purchase natural gas supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparties and supply natural gas to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price and variable-price contracts. 
 
 Our Operations 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we operated in 102 utility service territories across 19 states and the District of Columbia and had approximately 331,000 residential customer equivalents RCEs ). An RCE is an industry standard measure of natural gas or electricity usage with each RCE representing annual consumption of 100 MMBtu of natural gas or 10 MWh of electricity. We serve natural gas customers in fifteen states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and electricity customers in twelve states (Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas) and the District of Columbia using seven brands (Electricity Maine, Electricity N.H., Major Energy, Provider Power Mass, Respond Power, Spark Energy, and Verde Energy). 
 
 Customer Contracts and Product Offerings 
 
 Fixed and variable-price contracts 
 
 We offer a variety of fixed-price and variable-price service options to our natural gas and electricity customers. Under our fixed-price service options, our customers purchase natural gas and electricity at a fixed price over the life of the customer contract, which provides our customers with protection against increases in natural gas and electricity prices. Our fixed-price contracts typically have a term of one to two years for residential customers and up to four years for commercial customers, and most provide for an early termination fee in the event that the customer terminates service prior to the expiration of the contract term. In a typical market, we offer fixed-price electricity plans for 6, 12 and 24 months and fixed-price natural gas plans from 12 to 24 months, which may or may not provide for a monthly service fee and/or a termination fee, depending on the market and customer type. Our variable-price service options carry a month-to-month term and are priced based on our forecasts of underlying commodity prices and other market and business factors, including the competitive landscape in the market and the regulatory environment, and may also include a monthly service fee depending on the market and customer type. Our variable plans may or may not provide for a termination fee, depending on the market and customer type. 
 
 The fixed/variable splits of our RCEs were as follows as of December 31, 2022:

Green products and renewable energy credits 
 
 The reduction of carbon emission has become a major focus around the world. We offer renewable and carbon neutral green products in several markets. Green energy products are a growing market opportunity and typically provide increased unit margins as a result of improved customer satisfaction. Renewable electricity products allow customers to choose electricity sourced from wind, solar, hydroelectric and biofuel sources, through the purchase of renewable energy credits RECs ). A REC is a market-based instrument that represents the realized renewable attributes of renewable-based power generation. When we procure RECs on behalf of our customers, we are claiming their share of renewable generation that was delivered to the electric grid, directly supporting renewable generators. 
 
 Carbon neutral natural gas products give customers the option to reduce or eliminate the carbon footprint associated with their energy usage through the purchase of carbon offset credits. These products typically provide for fixed or variable prices and generally follow the same terms as our other products with the added benefit of carbon reduction and reduced environmental impact. 
 
 We utilize RECs to offset customer volumes related to customers enrolled in renewable energy plans. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 29 of our customers utilized green products. Also, as a key element of our corporate rebranding and our commitment to sustainability, we began offsetting 100 of customer volume beginning in the second quarter of 2021, by procuring RECs on behalf of our customers. 
 
 In addition to the RECs we purchase to satisfy our voluntary requirements under the terms of our green contracts with our customers and to support our corporate sustainability initiatives, we must also purchase a specified number of RECs based on the amount of electricity we sell in a state in a year pursuant to individual state renewable portfolio standards. We forecast the price for the required RECs and incorporate this cost component into our customer pricing models. 
 
 Customer Acquisition and Retention 
 
 Our customer acquisition strategy consists of customer growth obtained through traditional sales channels complemented by customer portfolio and business acquisitions. We make decisions on how best to deploy capital based on a variety of factors, including cost to acquire customers, availability of opportunities and our view of commodity pricing in particular regions. 
 
 We strive to maintain a disciplined approach to recovery of our customer acquisition costs within a 12-month period. We capitalize and amortize our customer acquisition costs over a two-year period, which is based on our estimate of the expected average length of a customer relationship. We factor in the recovery of customer 
 9 

Table of Contents 

acquisition costs in determining which markets we enter and the pricing of our products in those markets. Accordingly, our results are significantly influenced by our customer acquisition costs. 
 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain public utility commissions, regulatory agencies, and other governmental authorities in all of our markets have issued orders that impact the way we have historically acquired customers, such as door to door marketing. Our reduced marketing resulted in significantly reduced customer acquisition costs during 2020 and 2021 compared to historical amounts. As these orders have largely expired, our customer acquisition costs with respect to door to door marketing has increased during 2022. We are unable to predict our future customer acquisition costs at this time. Please see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report. 
 
 We are currently focused on growing through organic sales channels; however, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire customers through acquisitions and pursue such acquisitions when it makes sense economically or strategically. 
 
 Organic Growth 
 
 We use organic sales strategies to both maintain and grow our customer base by offering products providing options for term flexibility, price certainty, variable rates and/or green product offerings. We manage growth on a market-by-market basis by developing price curves in each of the markets we serve and create product offerings in which our targeted customer segments find value. The attractiveness of a product from a consumer s standpoint is based on a variety of factors, including overall pricing, price stability, contract term, sources of generation and environmental impact and whether or not the contract provides for termination and other fees. Product pricing is also based on several other factors, including the cost to acquire customers in the market, the competitive landscape and supply issues that may affect pricing. 
 
 Once a product has been created for a particular market, we then develop a marketing campaign. We identify and acquire customers through a variety of sales channels, including our inbound customer care call center, outbound calling, online marketing, opt-in web-based leads, email, direct mail, door-to-door sales, affinity programs, direct sales, brokers and consultants. For residential customers, we have historically used indirect sales brokers, web based solicitation, door-to-door sales, outbound calling, and other methods. For 2022, the largest channels were direct sales, telemarketing and web-based sales. We typically use brokers or direct marketing to obtain C I customers, which are typically larger and have greater natural gas and electricity requirements. At December 31, 2022, our customer base was 67 residential and 33 C I customers. In our sales practices, we typically employ multiple vendors under short-term contracts and have not entered into any exclusive marketing arrangements with sales vendors. Our marketing team continuously evaluates the effectiveness of each customer acquisition channel and makes adjustments in order to achieve targeted growth and manage customer acquisition costs. We strive to maintain a disciplined approach to recovery of our customer acquisition costs within defined periods. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 We actively monitor acquisition opportunities that may arise in the domestic acquisition market, and seek to acquire portfolios of customers and broker book acquisitions, as well as retail energy companies utilizing some combination of cash and borrowings under our senior secured borrowing base credit facility ("Senior Credit Facility), the issuance of common or preferred stock, or other financing arrangements. Historically, our customer acquisition strategy has been executed using both third parties and through affiliated relationships. See Relationship with our Founder, Majority Shareholder and Chief Executive Officer for a discussion of affiliate relationships. 
 
 The following table provides a summary of our acquisitions over the past five years:

 Please see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report for a discussion of risks related to our acquisition strategy and ability to finance such transactions. 
 
 Retaining customers and maximizing customer lifetime value 
 
 Following the acquisition of a customer, we devote significant attention to customer retention. We have developed a disciplined renewal communication process, which is designed to effectively reach our customers prior to the end of the contract term, and employ a team dedicated to managing this renewal communications process. Customers are contacted in each utility prior to the expiration of the customer's contract. We may contact the customer through additional channels such as outbound calls or email. We also apply a proprietary evaluation and segmentation process to optimize value to both us and the customer. We analyze historical usage, attrition rates and consumer behaviors to specifically tailor competitive products that aim to maximize the total expected return from energy sales to a specific customer, which we refer to as customer lifetime value. 
 
 We actively monitor unit margins from energy sales. We use this information to assess the results of products and to guide business decisions, including whether to engage in pro-active non-renewal of lower margin customers. 
 
 Commodity Supply 
 
 We hedge and procure our energy requirements from various wholesale energy markets, including both physical and financial markets, through short- and long-term contracts. Our in-house energy supply team is responsible for managing our commodity positions (including energy procurement, capacity, transmission, renewable energy, and resource adequacy requirements) within our risk management policies. We procure our natural gas and electricity requirements at various trading hubs, city-gates and load zones. When we procure commodities at trading hubs, we are responsible for delivery to the applicable local regulated utility for distribution. 
 
 In most markets, we hedge our electricity exposure with financial products and then purchase the physical power directly from the ISO for delivery. Alternatively, we may use physical products to hedge our electricity exposure rather than buying physical electricity in the day-ahead market from the ISO. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we transacted physical and financial settlements of electricity with approximately nine suppliers. 
 
 We are assessed monthly for ancillary charges such as reserves and capacity in the electricity sector by the ISOs. For example, the ISOs will charge all retail electricity providers for monthly reserves that the ISO determines are necessary to protect the integrity of the grid. Many of the utilities we serve also allocate natural gas transportation and storage assets to us as a part of their competitive choice program. We are required to fill our allocated storage 
 11 

Table of Contents 

capacity with natural gas, which creates commodity supply and price risk. Sometimes we cannot hedge the volumes associated with these assets because they are too small compared to the much larger bulk transaction volumes required for trades in the wholesale market or it is not economically feasible to do so. 
 
 We periodically adjust our portfolio of purchase/sale contracts in the wholesale natural gas market based upon analysis of our forecasted load requirements. Natural gas is then delivered to the local regulated utility city-gate or other specified delivery point where the local regulated utility takes control of the natural gas and delivers it to individual customer locations. Additionally, we hedge our natural gas price exposure with financial products. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we transacted physical and financial settlements of natural gas with approximately 81 wholesale counterparties. 
 
 We also enter into back-to-back wholesale transactions to optimize our credit lines with third-party energy suppliers. With each of our third-party energy suppliers, we have certain contracted credit lines, which allow us to purchase energy supply from these counterparties. If we desire to purchase supply beyond these credit limits, we are required to post collateral in the form of either cash or letters of credit. As we begin to approach the limits of our credit line with one supplier, we may purchase energy supply from another supplier and sell that supply to the original counterparty in order to reduce our net position with that counterparty and open up additional credit to procure supply in the future. Our sales of gas pursuant to these activities also enable us to optimize our credit lines with third-party energy suppliers by decreasing our net buy position with those suppliers. 
 
 Asset Optimization 
 
 Part of our business includes asset optimization activities in which we identify opportunities in the wholesale natural gas markets in conjunction with our retail procurement and hedging activities. Many of the competitive pipeline choice programs in which we participate require us and other retail energy suppliers to take assignment of and manage natural gas transportation and storage assets upstream of their respective city-gate delivery points. In our allocated storage assets, we are obligated to buy and inject gas in the summer season (April through October) and sell and withdraw gas during the winter season (November through March). These injection and purchase obligations require us to take a seasonal long position in natural gas. Our asset optimization group determines whether market conditions justify hedging these long positions through additional derivative transactions. We also contract with third parties for transportation and storage capacity in the wholesale market and are responsible for reservation and demand charges attributable to both our allocated and third-party contracted transportation and storage assets. Our asset optimization group utilizes these allocated and third-party transportation and storage assets in a variety of ways to either improve profitability or optimize supply-side counterparty credit lines. 
 
 We frequently enter into spot market transactions in which we purchase and sell natural gas at the same point or we purchase natural gas at one location and ship it using our pipeline capacity for sale at another location, if we are able to capture a margin. We view these spot market transactions as low risk because we enter into the buy and sell transactions on a back-to-back basis. We also act as an intermediary for market participants who need assistance with short-term procurement requirements. Consumers and suppliers contact us with a need for a certain quantity of natural gas to be bought or sold at a specific location. When this occurs, we are able to use our contacts in the wholesale market to source the requested supply and capture a margin in these transactions. 
 
 Our risk policies require that optimization activities be limited to back-to-back purchase and sale transactions, or open positions subject to aggregate net open position limits, which are not held for a period longer than two months. Furthermore, all additional capacity procured outside of a utility allocation of retail assets must be approved by a risk committee. Hedges of our firm transportation obligations are limited to two years or less and hedging of interruptible capacity is prohibited. 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 We operate under a set of corporate risk policies and procedures relating to the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas, general risk management and credit and collections functions. Our in-house energy supply team is 
 12 

Table of Contents 

responsible for managing our commodity positions (including energy, capacity, transmission, renewable energy, and resource adequacy requirements) within our risk management policies. We attempt to increase the predictability of cash flows by following our hedging strategies. 
 
 Our risk committee has control and authority over all of our risk management activities. The risk committee establishes and oversees the execution of our credit risk management policy and our commodity risk policy. The risk management policies are reviewed at least annually by the risk management committee and such committee typically meets quarterly to assure that we have followed these policies. The risk committee also seeks to ensure the application of our risk management policies to new products that we may offer. The risk committee is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, who meet on a regular basis to review the status of the risk management activities and positions. Our risk team reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer and their compensation is unrelated to trading activity. Commodity positions are typically reviewed and updated daily based on information from our customer databases and pricing information sources. The risk policy sets volumetric limits on intra-day and end of day long and short positions in natural gas and electricity. With respect to specific hedges, we have established and approved a formal delegation of authority policy specifying each trader's authorized volumetric limits based on instrument type, lead time (time to trade flow), fixed price volume, index price volume and tenor (trade flow) for individual transactions. The risk team reports to the risk committee any hedging transactions that exceed these delegated transaction limits. The various risks we face in our risk management activities are discussed below. 
 
 Commodity Price and Volumetric Risk 
 
 Because our contracts require that we deliver full natural gas or electricity requirements to our customers and because our customers usage can be impacted by factors such as weather, we may periodically purchase more or less commodity than our aggregate customer volumetric needs. In buying or selling excess volumes, we may be exposed to commodity price volatility. In order to address the potential volumetric variability of our monthly deliveries for fixed-price customers, we implement various hedging strategies to attempt to mitigate our exposure. 
 
 Our commodity risk management strategy is designed to hedge substantially all of our forecasted volumes on our fixed-price customer contracts, as well as a portion of the near-term volumes on our variable-price customer contracts. We use both physical and financial products to hedge our fixed-price exposure. The efficacy of our risk management program may be adversely impacted by unanticipated events and costs that we are not able to effectively hedge, including abnormal customer attrition and consumption, certain variable costs associated with electricity grid reliability, pricing differences in the local markets for local delivery of commodities, unanticipated events that impact supply and demand, such as extreme weather, and abrupt changes in the markets for, or availability or cost of, financial instruments that help to hedge commodity price. 
 
 Variability in customer demand is primarily impacted by weather. We use utility-provided historical and/or forward projected customer volumes as a basis for our forecasted volumes and mitigate the risk of seasonal volume fluctuation for some customers by purchasing excess fixed-price hedges within our volumetric tolerances. Should seasonal demand exceed our weather-normalized projections, we may experience a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 From time to time, we also take further measures to reduce price risk and optimize our returns by: (i) maximizing the use of natural gas storage in our daily balancing market areas in order to give us the flexibility to offset volumetric variability arising from changes in winter demand; (ii) entering into daily swing contracts in our daily balancing markets over the winter months to enable us to increase or decrease daily volumes if demand increases or decreases; and (iii) purchasing out-of-the-money call options for contract periods with the highest seasonal volumetric risk to protect against steeply rising prices if our customer demands exceed our forecast. Being geographically diversified in our delivery areas also permits us, from time to time, to employ assets not being used in one area to other areas, thereby mitigating potential increased costs for natural gas that we otherwise may have had to acquire at higher prices to meet increased demand.

We utilize New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX settled financial instruments to offset price risk associated with volume commitments under fixed-price contracts. The valuation for these financial instruments is calculated daily based on the NYMEX Exchange published closing price, and they are settled using the NYMEX Exchange s published settlement price at their maturity. 
 
 Basis Risk 
 
 We are exposed to basis risk in our operations when the commodities we hedge are sold at different delivery points from the exposure we are seeking to hedge. For example, if we hedge our natural gas commodity price with Chicago basis but physical supply must be delivered to the individual delivery points of specific utility systems around the Chicago metropolitan area, we are exposed to the risk that prices may differ between the Chicago delivery point and the individual utility system delivery points. These differences can be significant from time to time, particularly during extreme, unforecasted cold weather conditions. Similarly, in certain of our electricity markets, customers pay the load zone price for electricity, so if we purchase supply to be delivered at a hub, we may have basis risk between the hub and the load zone electricity prices due to local congestion that is not reflected in the hub price. We attempt to hedge basis risk where possible, but hedging instruments are occasionally not economically feasible or available in the smaller quantities that we require. 
 
 Customer Credit Risk 
 
 Our credit risk management policies are designed to limit customer credit exposure. Credit risk is managed through participation in purchase of receivables ("POR") programs in utility service territories where such programs are available. In these markets, we monitor the credit ratings of the local regulated utilities and the parent companies of the utilities that purchase our customer accounts receivable. We also periodically review payment history and financial information for the local regulated utilities to ensure that we identify and respond to any deteriorating trends. In non-POR markets, we assess the creditworthiness of new applicants, monitor customer payment activities and administer an active collection program. Using risk models, past credit experience and different levels of exposure in each of the markets, we monitor our receivable aging, bad debt forecasts and actual bad debt expenses and adjust as necessary. 
 
 In territories where POR programs have been established, the local regulated utility purchases our receivables, and then becomes responsible for billing and collecting payment from the customer. In return for their assumption of risk, we receive slightly discounted proceeds on the receivables sold. POR programs result in substantially all of our credit risk being linked to the applicable utility and not to our end-use customers in these territories. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 59 of our retail revenues were derived from territories in which substantially all of our credit risk was directly linked to local regulated utility companies, all of which had investment grade ratings. During the same period, we paid these local regulated utilities a weighted average discount of approximately 0.9 of total revenues for customer credit risk. In certain of the POR markets in which we operate, the utilities limit their collections exposure by retaining the ability to transfer a delinquent account back to us for collection when collections are past due for a specified period. If our subsequent collection efforts are unsuccessful, we return the account to the local regulated utility for termination of service to the extent the ability to terminate service has not been limited as a result of regulatory orders. Under these service programs, we are exposed to credit risk related to payment for services rendered during the time between when the customer is transferred to us by the local regulated utility and the time we return the customer to the utility for termination of service, which is generally one to two billing periods. We may also realize a loss on fixed-price customers in this scenario due to the fact that we will have already fully hedged the customer s expected commodity usage for the life of the contract. 
 
 In non-POR markets (and in POR markets where we may choose to direct bill our customers), we manage customer credit risk through formal credit review in the case of commercial customers, and credit score screening, deposits and disconnection for non-payment, in the case of residential customers. Economic conditions may affect our customers ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an 
 14 

Table of Contents 

increase in bad debt expense. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents our estimate of potential credit losses associated with accounts receivable from customers within these markets. 
 
 We assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts through review of an aging of customer accounts receivable and general economic conditions in the markets that we serve. Our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 6.9 million, or 1.5 of retail revenues. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Drivers of Our Business Customer Credit Risk for a more detailed discussion of our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 We do not have high concentrations of sales volumes to individual customers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our largest customer accounted for less than 1 of total retail energy sales. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk in Wholesale Markets 
 
 We do not independently produce natural gas and electricity and depend upon third parties for our supply, which exposes us to wholesale counterparty credit risk in our retail and asset optimization activities. If the counterparties to our supply contracts are unable to perform their obligations, we may suffer losses, including those that occur as a result of being unable to secure replacement supplies of natural gas or electricity on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all. At December 31, 2022, approximately 1.9 million of our total exposure of 2.8 million was either with a non-investment grade counterparty or otherwise not secured with collateral or a guarantee. 
 
 Operational Risk 
 
 As with all companies, we are at risk from cyber-attacks (breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code or other events) that could materially adversely affect our business, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. We mitigate these risks through multiple layers of security controls including policy, hardware, and software security solutions. We also have engaged third parties to assist with both external and internal vulnerability scans and continually enhance awareness through employee education and accountability. During 2022, we did not experience any material loss related to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. 
 
 Relationship with our Founder, Majority Shareholder, and Chief Executive Officer 
 
 We have historically leveraged our relationship with affiliates of our founder, majority shareholder and Chief Executive Officer, W. Keith Maxwell III (our Founder ), to execute our strategy, including sourcing acquisitions, financing, and operations support. Our Founder owns NG E, which was formed for the purpose of purchasing retail energy companies and retail customer books that may ultimately be resold to us. This relationship has afforded us access to opportunities that may not have otherwise been available to us due to our size and availability of capital. 
 
 We may engage in additional transactions with NG E in the future and expect that any such transactions would be funded by a combination of cash, subordinated debt, or the issuance of Class A or Class B common stock. Actual consideration paid for the assets would depend, among other things, on our capital structure and liquidity at the time of any transaction. Although we believe our Founder would be incentivized to offer us additional acquisition opportunities, he and his affiliates are under no obligation to do so, and we are under no obligation to buy assets from them. Any acquisition activity involving NG E or any other affiliate of our Founder will be subject to negotiation and approval by a special committee of our Board of Directors consisting solely of independent directors. Please see Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report for risks related to acquisitions and transactions with our affiliates.

Competition 
 
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our primary competition comes from the incumbent utility and other independent retail energy companies. In the electricity sector, these competitors include larger, well-capitalized energy retailers such as Calpine Energy Solutions, LLC, Constellation Corporation, NRG Energy, Inc. and Vistra Corp. We also compete with small local retail energy providers in the electricity sector that are focused exclusively on certain markets. Each market has a different group of local retail energy providers. In the natural gas sector, our national competitors are primarily NRG, Inc. Energy and Constellation Energy Group, Inc. Our national competitors generally have diversified energy platforms with multiple marketing approaches and broad geographic coverage similar to us. Competition in each market is based primarily on product offering, price and customer service. The number of competitors in our markets varies. In well-established markets in the Northeast and Texas we have hundreds of competitors, while in other markets the competition is limited to several participants. Markets that offer POR programs are generally more competitive than those markets in which retail energy providers bear customer credit risk. 
 
 Our ability to compete depends on our ability to convince customers to switch to our products and services, renew services with customers upon expiration of their contract terms, and our ability to offer products at attractive prices. Many local regulated utilities and their affiliates may possess the advantages of name recognition, longer operating histories, long-standing relationships with their customers and access to financial and other resources, which could pose a competitive challenge to us. As a result of our competitors' advantages, many customers of these local regulated utilities may decide to stay with their longtime energy provider if they have been satisfied with their service in the past. In addition, competitors may choose to offer more attractive short-term pricing to increase their market share. 
 
 Seasonality of Our Business 
 
 Our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis depending on: (i) the geographic mix of our customer base; (ii) the relative concentration of our commodity mix; (iii) weather conditions, which directly influence the demand for natural gas and electricity and affect the prices of energy commodities; and (iv) variability in market prices for natural gas and electricity. These factors can have material short-term impacts on monthly and quarterly operating results, which may be misleading when considered outside of the context of our annual operating cycle. 
 
 Our accounts payable and accounts receivable are impacted by seasonality due to the timing differences between when we pay our suppliers for accounts payable versus when we collect from our customers on accounts receivable. We typically pay our suppliers for purchases of natural gas on a monthly basis and electricity on a weekly basis. However, it takes approximately two months from the time we deliver the electricity or natural gas to our customers before we collect from our customers on accounts receivable attributable to those product deliveries. This timing difference affects our cash flows, especially during peak cycles in the winter and summer months. 
 
 Natural gas accounted for approximately 24 of our retail revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, which exposes us to a high degree of seasonality in our cash flows and income earned throughout the year as a result of the high concentration of heating load in the winter months. We utilize a considerable amount of cash from operations and borrowing capacity to fund working capital, which includes inventory purchases from April through October each year. We sell our natural gas inventory during the months of November through March of each year. We expect that the significant seasonality impacts to our cash flows and income will continue in future periods. 
 
 Regulatory Environment 
 
 We operate in the highly regulated natural gas and electricity retail sales industry in all of our respective jurisdictions, and must comply with the legislation and regulations in these jurisdictions in order to maintain our licenses to operate. We must also comply with the applicable regulations in order to obtain the necessary licenses in 
 16 

Table of Contents 

jurisdictions in which we plan to compete. Licensing requirements vary by state, but generally involve regular, standardized reporting in order to maintain a license in good standing with the state commission responsible for regulating retail electricity and gas suppliers. We believe there is potential for changes to state legislation and regulatory measures addressing licensing requirements that may impact our business model in the applicable jurisdictions. In addition, as further discussed below, our marketing activities and customer enrollment procedures are subject to rules and regulations at the state and federal levels, and failure to comply with requirements imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities could impact our licensing in a particular market. See "Risk Factors We face risks due to increasing regulation of the retail energy industry at the state level." 
 
 New Jersey and Connecticut 
 
 Certain state commissions have begun efforts to restrict the ability of retail suppliers to pass through costs to customers associated with certain changes in law or regulatory requirements. For example, on January 22, 2019, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities NJ BPU sent a cease and desist letter to third party suppliers TPS in New Jersey instructing that a TPS may not charge a customer rate that is higher than the fixed rate applicable during the period for which that rate was fixed. The letter notified TPS that such increases were prohibited and instructed TPS to refund customers amounts charged in excess of the applicable fixed rate. Parties have challenged the NJ BPU s letter and it is not clear at this time whether refunds will be required. Similarly, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority PURA opened a docket after receiving complaints regarding increases by suppliers to certain fixed-price supplier contracts due to change in law triggers. PURA will consider whether suppliers actions constitute unfair and deceptive trade practices or otherwise violates applicable laws. These state actions provide examples where the Company may be required to assume costs that it otherwise would pass on to customers under its change in law provisions and potentially provide refunds to certain customers. 
 
 Other Regulations 
 
 Our marketing efforts to consumers, including but not limited to telemarketing, door-to-door sales, direct mail and online marketing, are subject to consumer protection regulation including state deceptive trade practices acts, Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") marketing standards, and state utility commission rules governing customer solicitations and enrollments, among others. By way of example, telemarketing activity is subject to federal and state do-not-call regulation and certain enrollment standards promulgated by state regulators. Door-to-door sales are governed by the FTC s Cooling-Off Rule" as well as state-specific regulation in many jurisdictions. In markets in which we conduct customer credit checks, these checks are subject to the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Violations of the rules and regulations governing our marketing and sales activity could impact our license to operate in a particular market, result in suspension or otherwise limit our ability to conduct marketing activity in certain markets, and potentially lead to private actions against us. Moreover, there is potential for changes to legislation and regulatory measures applicable to our marketing measures that may impact our business models. 
 
 Recent interpretations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the TCPA by the Federal Communications Commission FCC have introduced confusion regarding what constitutes an autodialer for purposes of determining compliance under the TCPA. Also, additional restrictions have been placed on wireless telephone numbers making compliance with the TCPA more costly. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry Liability under the TCPA has increased significantly in recent years, and we face risks if we fail to comply. 
 As compliance with the federal TCPA regulations and state telemarketing regulations becomes increasingly costly and as door-to-door marketing becomes increasingly risky both from a regulatory compliance perspective, and from the risk of such activities drawing class action litigation claims, we and our peers who rely on these sales channels will find it more difficult than in the past to engage in direct marketing efforts. In response to these risks, we are experimenting with new technologies, such as a web-based application to process door-to-door sales enrollments with direct input by the consumer. This application can be accessed using tablets or any smart phone device, which enhances and expands the opportunities to market directly to customers.

Our participation in natural gas and electricity wholesale markets to procure supply for our retail customers and hedge pricing risk is subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"), including regulation pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In order to sell electricity, capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale electricity markets, we are required to have market-based rate authorization, also known as MBR Authorization, from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). We are required to make status update filings to FERC to disclose any affiliate relationships and quarterly filings to FERC regarding volumes of wholesale electricity sales in order to maintain our MBR Authorization. We are also required to seek prior approval by FERC to the extent any direct or indirect change in control occurs with respect to entities that hold MBR Authorization. 
 
 The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects our ability to procure natural gas supply for our retail customers and hedge pricing risk. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. FERC s orders do not attempt to directly regulate natural gas retail sales. As a shipper of natural gas on interstate pipelines, we are subject to those interstate pipelines' tariff requirements and FERC regulations and policies applicable to shippers. 
 
 Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas marketers and local regulated utilities with which we compete. 
 
 In December 2007, FERC issued Order 704, a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing. Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas gatherers and marketers, are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC s policy statement on price reporting. As a wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas, we are subject to the reporting requirements of Order 704. 
 
 Employees 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 160 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

We are dedicated to attracting and retaining talent across a variety of backgrounds, with varying experiences, perspectives and ideas, while having an inclusive culture. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 49 of our workforce was male and 51 female.

 Our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could be materially and adversely affected by, and the price of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could decline due to a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors together with the other information contained in this Annual Report. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 
 We are subject to commodity price risk. 
 
 Our financial results are largely dependent on the prices at which we can acquire the commodities we resell. The prevailing market prices for natural gas and electricity are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Changes in market prices for natural gas and electricity may result from many factors that are outside of our control, including: 
 weather conditions; including extreme weather conditions, seasonal fluctuations, and the effects of climate change; 
 demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions; 
 disruption of natural gas or electricity transmission or transportation infrastructure or other constraints or inefficiencies; 
 reduction or unavailability of generating capacity, including temporary outages, mothballing, or retirements; 
 the level of prices and availability of natural gas and competing energy sources, including the impact of changes in environmental regulations impacting suppliers; 
 the creditworthiness or bankruptcy or other financial distress of market participants; 
 changes in market liquidity; 
 natural disasters, wars, embargoes, acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events; 
 significant changes in the pricing methods in the wholesale markets in which we operate; 
 changes in regulatory policies concerning how markets are structured, how compensation is provided for service, and the kinds of different services that can or must be offered; 
 federal, state, foreign and other governmental regulation and legislation; and 
 demand side management, conservation, alternative or renewable energy sources. 
 
 For example, in February 2021, the U.S. experienced winter storm Uri, an unprecedented storm bringing extreme cold temperatures to the central U.S., including Texas. As a result of increased power demand for customers across the state of Texas and power generation disruptions during the weather event, power and ancillary costs in the Electric Reliability Counsel of Texas ERCOT service area experienced extreme volatility and price increases beyond the maximum allowed clearing prices. Less extreme price fluctuations can also occur as a result of routine winter weather fluctuations. 
 
 In the event of price fluctuations, we may not be able to pass along changes to the prices we pay to acquire commodities to our customers as such pricing fluctuations can attract consumer class actions as well as state and federal regulatory actions. 
 Our financial results may be adversely impacted by weather conditions and changes in consumer demand. 
 Weather conditions directly influence the demand for and availability of natural gas and electricity and affect the prices of energy commodities. Generally, on most utility systems, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter and demand for electricity peaks in the summer. Typically, when winters are warmer or summers are cooler, demand for energy is lower than expected, resulting in less natural gas and electricity consumption than forecasted. When demand is below anticipated levels due to weather patterns, we may be forced to sell excess supply at prices below our acquisition cost, which could result in reduced margins or even losses. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

Conversely, when winters are colder or summers are warmer, consumption may outpace the volumes of natural gas and electricity against which we have hedged, and we may be unable to meet increased demand with storage or swing supply. In these circumstances, such as with winter storm Uri, we may experience reduced margins or even losses if we are required to purchase additional supply at higher prices. We may fail to accurately anticipate demand due to fluctuations in weather or to effectively manage our supply in response to a fluctuating commodity price environment. 
 Further, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, winter storms and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. Destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues. 
 Our risk management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and we may fail to fully or effectively hedge our commodity supply and price risk. 
 To provide energy to our customers, we purchase commodities in the wholesale energy markets, which are often highly volatile. Our commodity risk management strategy is designed to hedge substantially all of our forecasted volumes on our fixed-price customer contracts, as well as a portion of the near-term volumes on our variable-price customer contracts. We use both physical and financial products to hedge our exposure. The efficacy of our risk management program may be adversely impacted by unanticipated events and costs that we are not able to effectively hedge, including abnormal customer attrition and consumption, certain variable costs associated with electricity grid reliability, pricing differences in the local markets for local delivery of commodities, unanticipated events that impact supply and demand, such as extreme weather, and abrupt changes in the markets for, or availability or cost of, financial instruments that help to hedge commodity price. 
 We are exposed to basis risk in our operations when the commodities we hedge are sold at different delivery points from the exposure we are seeking to hedge. For example, if we hedge our natural gas commodity price with Chicago basis but physical supply must be delivered to the individual delivery points of specific utility systems around the Chicago metropolitan area, we are exposed to basis risk between the Chicago basis and the individual utility system delivery points. These differences can be significant from time to time, particularly during extreme, unforecasted cold weather conditions. Similarly, in certain of our electricity markets, customers pay the load zone price for electricity, so if we purchase supply to be delivered at a hub, we may have basis risk between the hub and the load zone electricity prices due to local congestion that is not reflected in the hub price. We attempt to hedge basis risk where possible, but hedging instruments are sometimes not economically feasible or available in the smaller quantities that we require. 
 Additionally, assumptions that we use in establishing our hedges may reduce the effectiveness of our hedging instruments. Considerations that may affect our hedging policies include, but are not limited to, human error, assumptions about customer attrition, the relationship of prices at different trading or delivery points, assumptions about future weather, and our load forecasting models. 
 Our derivative instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting requirements and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings. As a result, the Company s quarterly and annuals results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by the changes in market price. 
 In addition, we incur costs monthly for ancillary charges such as reserves and capacity in the electricity sector by ISOs. For example, the ISOs will charge all retail electricity providers for monthly reserves that the ISO determines are necessary to protect the integrity of the grid. We may be unable to fully pass the higher cost of ancillary reserves and reliability services through to our customers, and increases in the cost of these ancillary reserves and reliability services could negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Many of the natural gas utilities we serve allocate a share of transportation and storage capacity to us as a part of their competitive market operations. We are required to fill our allocated storage capacity with natural gas, which 
 22 

Table of Contents 

creates commodity supply and price risk. Sometimes we cannot hedge the volumes associated with these assets because they are too small compared to the much larger bulk transaction volumes required for trades in the wholesale market or it is not economically feasible to do so. In some regulatory programs or under some contracts, this capacity may be subject to recall by the utilities, which could have the effect of us being required to access the spot market to cover such a recall. 
 ESCOs face risks due to increased and rapidly changing regulations and increasing monetary fines by the state regulatory agencies. 
 
 The retail energy industry is highly regulated. Regulations may be changed or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations applicable to our business could be implemented in the future. To the extent that the competitive restructuring of retail electricity and natural gas markets is reversed, altered or discontinued, such changes could have a detrimental impact on our business and overall financial condition. 
 
 Some states are beginning to increase their regulation of their retail electricity and natural gas markets in an effort to increase consumer disclosures and ensure marketing practices are not misleading to consumers. In addition, the fines against ESCOs that regulators are seeking have increased dramatically in recent years. For example, late 2022 PURA and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel issued to our subsidiary, Verde, a Notice of Violation and Assessment of Penalty proposing civil penalties, restitution payments to certain customers and a multi-year suspension from the Connecticut market in connection with violations of Connecticut s marketing requirements for energy suppliers. 
 
 The retail energy business is subject to a high level of federal, state and local regulations, which are subject to change. 
 
 Many governmental bodies regulate aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations, including executive orders, or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Changes under a new president, administration and Congress in the U.S. are also difficult to predict. Any such variation could negatively impact the retail energy business, including our business, could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. 
 For example, many electricity markets have rate caps, and changes to these rate caps by regulators can impact future price exposure. Similarly, regulatory changes can result in new fees or charges that may not have been anticipated when existing retail contracts were drafted, which can create financial exposure. Our ability to manage cost increases that result from regulatory changes will depend, in part, on how the change in law provisions of our contracts are interpreted and enforced, among other factors. 
 
 Liability under the TCPA has increased significantly in recent years, and we face risks if we fail to comply. 
 
 Our outbound telemarketing efforts and use of mobile messaging to communicate with our customers, which has increased in recent years, subjects us to regulation under the TCPA. Over the last several years, companies have been subject to significant liabilities as a result of violations of the TCPA, including penalties, fines and damages under class action lawsuits. Our failure to effectively monitor and comply with our activities that are subject to the TCPA could result in significant penalties and the adverse effects of having to defend and ultimately suffer liability in a class action lawsuit related to such non-compliance. 
 
 We are also subject to liability under the TCPA for actions of our third party vendors who are engaging in outbound telemarketing efforts on our behalf. The issue of vicarious liability for the actions of third parties in violation of the TCPA remains unclear and has been the subject of conflicting precedent in the federal appellate courts. There can be no assurance that we may be subject to significant damages as a result of a class action lawsuit for actions of our vendors that we may not be able to control.

We are, and in the future may become, involved in legal and regulatory proceedings and, as a result, may incur substantial costs. 
 We are subject to lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business from time to time, including several purported class action lawsuits involving sales practices, telemarketing and TCPA claims, as well as contract disclosure claims and breach of contract claims. These are in various stages and are subject to substantial uncertainties concerning the outcome. 
 A negative outcome for any of these matters could result in significant costs, may divert management's attention from other business issues or harm our reputation with customers. 
 For additional information regarding the nature and status of certain proceedings, see Note 13 "Commitments and Contingencies" to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Our business is dependent on retaining licenses in the markets in which we operate. 
 Our business model is dependent on continuing to be licensed in existing markets. We may have a license revoked or not be granted a renewal of a license, or our license could be adversely conditioned or modified (e.g., by increased bond posting obligations). For example, recently, an ESCO was banned by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio from operating in Ohio for five years in response to allegations of misleading and deceptive marketing practices. 
 
 We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, which could cause us to fail to realize many of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. 
 
 We have grown our business in part through strategic acquisition opportunities from third parties and from affiliates of our majority shareholder and may continue to do so in the future. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these transactions depends in part upon our ability to identify accretive acquisition targets, accurately assess the benefits and risks of the acquisition prior to undertaking it, and the ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. When we identify an acquisition candidate, there is a risk that we may be unable to negotiate terms that are beneficial to us. Additionally, even if we identify an accretive acquisition target, the successful acquisition of that business requires estimating anticipated cash flow and accretive value, evaluating potential regulatory challenges, retaining customers and assuming liabilities. The accuracy of these estimates is inherently uncertain and our assumptions may be incorrect. 
 
 Furthermore, when we make an acquisition, we may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly or successfully. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of our business, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, compensation arrangements, distraction of management and significant costs, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Further, we may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. 
 
 In many of our acquisition agreements, we are entitled to indemnification from the counterparty for various matters, including breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, tax matters, and litigation proceedings. We generally obtain security to provide assurances that the counterparty could perform its indemnification obligations, which may be in the form of escrow accounts, payment withholding or other methods. However, to the extent that we do not obtain security, or the security turns out to be inadequate, there is a risk that the counterparty may fail to perform on its indemnification obligations, which could result in the losses being incurred by us. 
 
 Our ability to grow at levels experienced historically may be constrained if the market for acquisition candidates is limited and we are unable to make acquisitions of portfolios of customers and retail energy companies on commercially reasonable terms.

Pursuant to our cash dividend policy, we distribute a significant portion of our cash through regular quarterly dividends, and our ability to grow and make acquisitions with cash on hand could be limited. 
 Pursuant to our cash dividend policy, we have historically distributed and intend in the future to distribute, a significant portion of our cash through regular quarterly dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. As such, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations, and we may have to rely upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt, equity securities, convertible subordinated notes and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility and Subordinated Facility. These sources may not be available, and our ability to grow and maintain our business may be limited. 
 We may have liquidity needs that would prevent us from continuing our historical practice as it relates to the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. The primary factor that would lead to a change in the dividend policy would be decreased liquidity due to decreasing customer book. 
 
 We may not be able to manage our growth successfully. 
 The growth of our operations will depend upon our ability to expand our customer base in our existing markets and to enter new markets in a timely manner at reasonable costs, organically or through acquisitions. In order for us to recover expenses incurred in entering new markets and obtaining new customers, we must attract and retain customers on economic terms and for extended periods. Customer growth depends on several factors outside of our control, including economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. We may experience difficulty managing our growth and implementing new product offerings, integrating new customers and employees, and complying with applicable market rules and the infrastructure for product delivery. 
 
 State regulations may adversely impact customer acquisition and renewal revenue and profitability, and organic growth. For example, New York State limits the types of services energy retailer marketers may offer new customers or renewals, in terms of pricing for non-renewable commodities and renewable product offerings. 
 
 Expanding our operations also may require continued development of our operating and financial controls and may place additional stress on our management and operational resources. We may be unable to manage our growth and development successfully. 
 
 Our financial results fluctuate on a seasonal, quarterly and annual basis. 
 Our overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal, quarterly and annual basis depending on: (1) the geographic mix of our customer base; (2) the relative concentration of our commodity mix; (3) weather conditions, which directly influence the demand for natural gas and electricity and affect the prices of energy commodities; and (4) variability in market prices for natural gas and electricity. These factors can have material short-term impacts on monthly and quarterly operating results, which may be misleading when considered outside of the context of our annual operating cycle. In addition, our accounts payable and accounts receivable are impacted by seasonality due to the timing differences between when we pay our suppliers for accounts payable versus when we collect from our customers on accounts receivable. We typically pay our suppliers for purchases of natural gas on a monthly basis and electricity on a weekly basis. However, it takes approximately two months from the time we deliver the electricity or natural gas to our customers before we collect from our customers on accounts receivable attributable to those product deliveries. This timing difference could affect our cash flows, especially during peak cycles in the winter and summer months. Furthermore, as a result of the seasonality of our business, we may reserve a portion of our excess cash available for distribution in the first and fourth quarters in order to fund our second and third quarter distributions. 
 Additionally, we enter into a variety of financial derivative and physical contracts to manage commodity price risk, and we use mark-to-market accounting to account for this hedging activity. Under the mark-to-market accounting method, changes in the fair value of our hedging instruments that are not qualifying or not designated as hedges 
 25 

Table of Contents 

under accounting rules are recognized immediately in earnings. As a result of this accounting treatment, changes in the forward prices of natural gas and electricity cause volatility in our quarterly and annual earnings, which we are unable to fully anticipate. 
 We could also incur volatility from quarter to quarter associated with gains and losses on settled hedges relating to natural gas held in inventory if we choose to hedge the summer-winter spread on our retail allocated storage capacity. We typically purchase natural gas inventory and store it from April to October for withdrawal from November through March. Since a portion of the inventory is used to satisfy delivery obligations to our fixed-price customers over the winter months, we hedge the associated price risk using derivative contracts. Any gains or losses associated with settled derivative contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as a component of retail cost of sales and net asset optimization. 
 We may have difficulty retaining our existing customers or obtaining a sufficient number of new customers, due to competition and for other reasons. 
 The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may face difficulty retaining our existing customers or obtaining new customers due to competition. We encounter significant competition from local regulated utilities or their retail affiliates and traditional and new retail energy providers. Competitors may offer different products, lower prices, and other incentives, which may attract customers away from our business. Many of these competitors or potential competitors are larger than us, have access to more significant capital resources, have stronger vendor relationships, have more well-established brand names and have larger existing installed customer bases. 
 Additionally, existing customers may switch to other retail energy service providers during their contract terms in the event of a significant decrease in the retail price of natural gas or electricity in order to obtain more favorable prices. Although we generally have a right to collect a termination fee from each customer on a fixed-price contract who terminates their contract early, we may not be able to collect the termination fees in full or at all. Our variable-price contracts can typically be terminated by our customers at any time without penalty. We may be unable to obtain new customers or maintain our existing customers due to competition or otherwise. 
 Increased collateral requirements in connection with our supply activities may restrict our liquidity. 
 Our contractual agreements with certain local regulated utilities and our supplier counterparties require us to maintain restricted cash balances or letters of credit as collateral for credit risk or the performance risk associated with the future delivery of natural gas or electricity. These collateral requirements may increase as we grow our customer base. Collateral requirements will increase based on the volume or cost of the commodity we purchase in any given month and the amount of capacity or service contracted for with the local regulated utility. Significant changes in market prices also can result in fluctuations in the collateral that local regulated utilities or suppliers require. 
 The effectiveness of our operations and future growth depend in part on the amount of cash and letters of credit available to enter into or maintain these contracts. The cost of these arrangements may be affected by changes in credit markets, such as interest rate spreads in the cost of financing between different levels of credit ratings. These liquidity requirements may be greater than we anticipate or are able to meet. 
 
 We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including COVID-19. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity and conditions worldwide. Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other major health crises, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect the United States' economic growth, demand for natural gas and electricity in our key markets as well as the ability of various employees, customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of any major public health

crisis, including COVID-19, may negatively impact our business, including a disruption of or change to our operating plans. 
 
 We are subject to direct credit risk for certain customers who may fail to pay their bills as they become due. 
 We bear direct credit risk related to customers located in markets that have not implemented POR programs as well as indirect credit risk in those POR markets that pass collection efforts along to us after a specified non-payment period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, customers in non-POR markets represented approximately 41 of our retail revenues. We generally have the ability to terminate contracts with customers in the event of non-payment, but in most states in which we operate we cannot disconnect their natural gas or electricity service. In POR markets where the local regulated utility has the ability to return non-paying customers to us after specified periods, we may realize a loss for one to two billing periods until we can terminate these customers contracts. We may also realize a loss on fixed-price customers in this scenario due to the fact that we will have already fully hedged the customer s expected commodity usage for the life of the contract and we also remain liable to our suppliers of natural gas and electricity for the cost of our supply commodities. Furthermore, in the Texas market, we are responsible for billing the distribution charges for the local regulated utility and are at risk for these charges, in addition to the cost of the commodity, in the event customers fail to pay their bills. Changing economic factors, such as rising unemployment rates and energy prices also result in a higher risk of customers being unable to pay their bills when due. 
 
 We depend on the accuracy of data in our information management systems, which subjects us to risks. 
 We depend on the accuracy and timeliness of our information management systems for billing, collections, consumption and other important data. We rely on many internal and external sources for this information, including: 
 our marketing, pricing and customer operations functions; and 
 various local regulated utilities and ISOs for volume or meter read information, certain billing rates and billing types (e.g., budget billing) and other fees and expenses. 
 Inaccurate or untimely information, which may be outside of our direct control, could result in: 
 inaccurate and/or untimely bills sent to customers; 
 incorrect tax remittances; 
 reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations; 
 inability to adequately hedge our portfolio; 
 increased overhead costs; 
 inaccurate accounting and reporting of customer revenues, gross margin and accounts receivable activity; 
 inaccurate measurement of usage rates, throughput and imbalances; 
 customer complaints; and 
 increased regulatory scrutiny. 
 We are also subject to disruptions in our information management systems arising out of events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, telecommunications and other similar disruptions. 
 
 Cyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Cybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication, magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. A cyber-attack on our information management systems or those of our vendors could severely disrupt business operations, preventing us from billing and collecting revenues, and could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage, lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny, 
 27

diminished customer confidence and damage to our reputation. Although we maintain cyber-liability insurance that covers certain damage caused by cyber events, it may not be sufficient to cover us in all circumstances. 
 Our success depends on key members of our management, the loss of whom could disrupt our business operations. 
 We depend on the continued employment and performance of key management personnel. A number of our senior executives have substantial experience in consumer and energy markets that have undergone regulatory restructuring and have extensive risk management and hedging expertise. We believe their experience is important to our continued success. We do not maintain key life insurance policies for our executive officers. Our key executives may not continue in their present roles and may not be adequately replaced. 
 
 We rely on third party vendors for our customer acquisition verification, billing and transactions platform that exposes us to third party performance risk and other risk. 
 We have outsourced our back office customer billing and transactions platforms to third party vendors, and we rely heavily on the continued performance of the vendors under our current outsourcing agreement. Our vendors may fail to operate in accordance with the terms of the outsourcing agreement, be subject to cyber-security attacks, or a bankruptcy or other event may prevent them from performing under our outsourcing agreement. 
 A large portion of our current customers are concentrated in a limited number of states, making us vulnerable to customer concentration risks. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 58 of our RCEs were located in five states. Specifically, 16 , 14 , 11 , 9 and 8 of our customers on an RCE basis were located in TX, PA, NY, NJ, and MA respectively. If we are unable to increase our market share across other competitive markets or enter into new competitive markets effectively, we may be subject to continued or greater customer concentration risk. The states that contain a large percentage of our customers could reverse regulatory restructuring or change the regulatory environment in a manner that causes us to be unable to operate economically in that state. 
 Increases in state renewable portfolio standards or an increase in the cost of renewable energy credit and carbon offsets may adversely impact the price, availability and marketability of our products. 
 Pursuant to state renewable portfolio standards, we must purchase a specified amount of RECs based on the amount of electricity we sell in a state in a year. In addition, we have contracts with certain customers that require us to purchase RECs or carbon offsets and as part of sustainability efforts have made a corporate commitment to fully offset 100 of customer volume beginning on April 1, 2021 with RECS or carbon offsets. If a state increases its renewable portfolio standards, the demand for RECs within that state will increase and therefore the market price for RECs could increase. We attempt to forecast the price for the required RECs and carbon offsets at the end of each month and incorporate this forecast into our customer pricing models, but the price paid for RECs and carbon offsets may be higher than forecasted. We may be unable to fully pass the higher cost of RECs through to our customers, and increases in the price of RECs may decrease our results of operations and affect our ability to compete with other energy retailers that have not contracted with customers to purchase RECs or carbon offsets. Further, a price increase for RECs or carbon offsets may require us to decrease the renewable portion of our energy products, which may result in a loss of customers. A further reduction in benefits received by local regulated utilities from production tax credits in respect of renewable energy may adversely impact the availability to us, and marketability by us, of renewable energy under our brands. 
 Our access to marketing channels may be contingent upon the viability of our telemarketing and door-to-door agreements with our vendors. 
 Our vendors are essential to our telemarketing and door-to-door sales activities. Our ability to increase revenues in the future will depend significantly on our access to high quality vendors. If we are unable to attract new vendors and retain existing vendors to achieve our marketing targets, our growth may be materially reduced. There can be no 
 28 

Table of Contents 

assurance that competitive conditions will allow these vendors and their independent contractors to continue to successfully sign up new customers. Further, if our products are not attractive to, or do not generate sufficient revenue for our vendors, we may lose our existing relationships. In addition, the decline in landlines reduces the number of potential customers that may be reached by our telemarketing efforts and, as a result, our telemarketing sales channel may become less viable and we may be required to use more door-to-door marketing. Door-to-door marketing is continually under scrutiny by state regulators and legislators, which may lead to new rules and regulations that impact our ability to use these channels. 
 
 Our vendors may expose us to risks. 
 We are subject to reputational risks that may arise from the actions of our vendors and their independent contractors that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as violations of our marketing policies and procedures as well as any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. If our vendors engage in marketing practices that are not in compliance with local laws and regulations, we may be in breach of applicable laws and regulations that may result in regulatory proceedings, disadvantageous conditioning of our energy retailer license, or the revocation of our energy retailer license. Unauthorized activities in connection with sales efforts by agents of our vendors, including calling consumers in violation of the TCPA and predatory door-to-door sales tactics and fraudulent misrepresentation could subject us to class action lawsuits against which we will be required to defend. Such defense efforts will be costly and time consuming. In addition, the independent contractors of our vendors may consider us to be their employer and seek compensation. 
 We rely on third party vendors for our customer billing and transactions platform that exposes us to third party performance risk and cyber-security risk. We have outsourced our back office customer verification, billing and transactions platforms to third party vendors, and we rely heavily on the continued performance of the vendors under our current outsourcing agreement. Our vendors may fail to operate in accordance with the terms of the outsourcing agreement or a bankruptcy or other event may prevent them from performing under our outsourcing agreement. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Capital Stock 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, decrease investor confidence in us, and reduce the value of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act and based upon the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Management is also responsible for reporting on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified a material weakness in the design and operation of the controls over our calculation of income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although this material weakness did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 or any prior period, it did result in immaterial corrections for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Please see Note 2. Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a description of the immaterial corrections. If unremediated, this material weakness could result in a material misstatement for annual or interim consolidated financial statements for future periods. 
 
 With oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we intend to take the necessary steps to remediate the material weakness by enhancing our internal controls to ensure proper review by and communication 
 29 

Table of Contents 

between our internal and external tax advisors and internal accounting personnel. Our efforts will consist primarily of strengthening our tax organization through continuing education and designing controls related to the components of our tax process to enhance our management review controls over taxes. We cannot assure you that any measures we may take will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described above or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. 
 
 Failure to remediate the material weakness described above, or the identification of any new material weaknesses, could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock and could subject us to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 
 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or pay dividends. It could also expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry as well as impact our cash available for distribution. 
 We have 100.0 million of indebtedness outstanding and 34.4 million in issued letters of credit under our Senior Credit Facility, and 20.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Subordinated Facility as of December 31, 2022. Debt we incur under our Senior Credit Facility, Subordinated Facility or otherwise could have negative consequences, including: 
 increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; 
 requiring cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing or eliminating our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, or to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; 
 limiting our ability to fund future acquisitions or engage in other activities that we view as in our long-term best interest; 
 restricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, in our credit facilities and other financing agreements; 
 exposing us to the risk of increased costs due to changes in interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and 
 limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt. 
 If we are unable to satisfy financial covenants in our debt instruments, it could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may entitle the lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests. Our Senior Credit Facility will mature in June 30, 2025, and we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a new credit arrangement on commercially reasonable terms. 
 In addition, our ability to arrange financing and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: 
 general economic and capital market conditions; 
 credit availability from banks and other financial institutions; 
 investor confidence; 
 our financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries; 
 our level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements; 
 maintenance of acceptable credit ratings; 
 cash flow; and 
 provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.

Table of Contents 

We may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations. 
 Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on many factors, including the performance of our business, cash flows, RCE counts and the margins we receive, as well as restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying our targeted quarterly dividend to the holders of our Class A common stock or dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in the future. The amount of our cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things: 
 changes in commodity prices, which may be driven by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, seasonality and demand for energy commodities and general economic conditions; 
 the level and timing of customer acquisition costs we incur; 
 the level of our operating and general and administrative expenses; 
 seasonal variations in revenues generated by our business; 
 our debt service requirements and other liabilities; 
 fluctuations in our working capital needs; 
 our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; 
 restrictions contained in our debt agreements (including our Senior Credit Facility); 
 management of customer credit risk; 
 abrupt changes in regulatory policies; and, 
 other business risks affecting our cash flows. 
 As a result of these and other factors, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay the dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock or to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. Further, we could be prevented from paying cash dividends under Delaware law if certain capital requirements are not met, and may be further restricted by covenants in our Senior Credit Facility. 
 The amount of cash available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate our cash available for distribution and, in turn, impair our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock during the period. Additionally, the dividends paid on Series A Preferred Stock reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. 
 Each new share of Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock issued increases the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends. Any Class A common stock or preferred stock (whether Series A Preferred Stock or a new series of preferred stock) that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions, upon exercise of stock options or otherwise, would have a similar effect. 
 
 Finally, our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon our operations, our financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities, the performance of our business, cash flows, RCE counts and the margins we receive, as well as restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility. The Board of Directors may be required to reduce or eliminate quarterly cash distributions, including the quarterly dividends to the holders of the Class A common stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock. Even if we are permitted to pay such dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, our Board of Directors may elect to reduce or eliminate the dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock to maintain cash balances for operations or for other reasons. Similarly, even if our business generates cash in excess of our current annual dividend, we may reinvest such excess cash flows in our business and not increase the dividends payable to holders of our Class A common stock. Any reduction or elimination of cash dividends on our 
 31 

Table of Contents 

Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock will likely materially and adversely affect the price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 We are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our equity interest in Spark HoldCo, LLC ("Spark HoldCo") and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Spark HoldCo to pay dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our equity interest in Spark HoldCo, and have no independent means of generating revenue. Therefore, we depend on distributions from Spark HoldCo to meet our debt service and other payment obligations, and to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. Spark HoldCo or its subsidiaries may be restricted from making distributions to us under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or may otherwise be unable to provide such funds. 
 The Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are subordinated to our existing and future debt obligations. 
 The Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility). Therefore, if we become bankrupt, liquidate our assets, reorganize or enter into certain other transactions, assets will be available to pay our obligations with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock only after we have paid all of our existing and future indebtedness in full. The Class A common stock will only receive assets to the extent all existing and future indebtedness and obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock is paid in full. If any of these events were to occur, there may be insufficient assets remaining to make any payments to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Class A common stock. 
 Additionally, none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed or otherwise become obligated with respect to the Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock effectively rank junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, including our operating subsidiaries, and any capital stock of our subsidiaries not held by us. Accordingly, our right to receive assets from any of our subsidiaries upon our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, and the right of holders of shares of Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock to participate in those assets, is also structurally subordinated to claims of that subsidiary s creditors, including trade creditors. Even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of that subsidiary senior to that held by us. 
 Numerous factors may affect the trading price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The trading price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock may depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: 
 prevailing interest rates; 
 the market for similar securities; 
 general economic and financial market conditions; 
 our issuance of debt or other preferred equity securities; and 
 our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 One of the factors that will influence the price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock will be the distribution yield of the securities (as a percentage of the then market price of the securities) relative to market interest rates. Increases in market interest rates, which have been at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock to expect a higher distribution yield, and cause them to sell their Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock to decrease.

In addition, over the last several years, prices of equity securities in the U.S. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations. As a result of these and other factors, investors holding our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock may experience a decrease in the value of their securities, which could be substantial and rapid, and could be unrelated to our financial condition, performance or prospects. 
 There may not be an active trading market for the Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, which may in turn reduce the market value and your ability to transfer or sell your shares of Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. 
 There are no assurances that there will be an active trading market for our Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock. The liquidity of any market for the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock depends upon the number of stockholders, our results of operations and financial condition, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and other factors. To the extent that an active trading market is not maintained, the liquidity and trading prices for the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock may be harmed. 
 Furthermore, because the Series A Preferred Stock does not have any stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption, stockholders seeking liquidity will be limited to selling their respective shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the secondary market. Active trading markets for the Series A Preferred Stock may not exist at such times, in which case the trading price of your shares of our Series A Preferred Stock could be reduced and your ability to transfer such shares could be limited. 
 Our Founder holds a substantial majority of the voting power of our common stock. 
 Holders of Class A and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Our Founder beneficially owns approximately 66.0 of the combined voting power (excluding treasury shares) of the Class A and Class B common stock as of December 31, 2022 through his direct and indirect ownership in us. 
 Affiliated owners are entitled to act separately with respect to their investment in us, and they have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors, and thereby to control our management and affairs. In addition, affiliates are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring Class A common stock and Class B common stock shareholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and is able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company. The existence of a significant shareholder, such as our Founder, may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. 
 So long as affiliates continue to control a significant amount of our common stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, regardless of whether other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of affiliates may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock or Series A Preferred Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling shareholder. 
 Holders of Series A Preferred Stock have extremely limited voting rights. 
 Voting rights of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are extremely limited. Our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock are the only classes of our securities carrying full voting rights. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights. As of April 15, 2022, we have the option to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock.

We have engaged in transactions with our affiliates in the past and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders best interests. 
 We have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies. We have acquired companies and books of customers from our affiliates and may do so in the future. We will continue to enter into back-to-back transactions for purchases of commodities and derivatives on behalf of our affiliate. We will also continue to pay certain expenses on behalf of several of our affiliates for which we will seek reimbursement. We will also continue to share our corporate headquarters with certain affiliates. We cannot assure that our affiliates will reimburse us for the costs we have incurred on their behalf or perform their obligations under any of these contracts. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. On August 5, 2022, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 allowing us to offer and sell, from time to time, among other securities, shares of preferred stock. The registration statement was declared effective on August 16, 2022. The election by our board of directors to issue preferred stock with anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. 
 In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws: 
 provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered three year terms. Our staggered board may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of the directors; 
 provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; 
 provide that all vacancies in our board, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 
 provide our board of directors the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock. This ability makes it possible for our board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of our company; 
 provide that at any time after the first date upon which W. Keith Maxwell III no longer beneficially owns more than fifty percent of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such shareholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series (prior to such time, such actions may be taken without a meeting by written consent of holders of the outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting); 
 provide that at any time after the first date upon which W. Keith Maxwell III no longer beneficially owns more than fifty percent of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock, special meetings of our shareholders may only be called by the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the chairman of the board (prior to such time, special meetings may also be called by our Secretary at the 
 34 

Table of Contents 

request of holders of record of fifty percent of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock); 
 provide that our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon; 
 provide that our amended and restated bylaws can be amended by the board of directors; and 
 establish advance notice procedures with regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our shareholders. These procedures provide that notice of shareholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. These requirements may preclude shareholders from bringing matters before the shareholders at an annual or special meeting. 
 In addition, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have elected not to be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers until the date on which W. Keith Maxwell III no longer beneficially owns in the aggregate more than fifteen percent of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. On and after such date, we will be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Future sales of our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock in the public market could reduce the price of the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and may dilute your ownership in us. 
 On August 5, 2022, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 registering the primary offer and sale, from time to time, of Class A common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement also registers the Class A common stock held by our affiliates, Retailco and NuDevco (including Class A common stock that may be obtained upon conversion of Class B common stock). All of the shares of Class A common stock held by Retailco and NuDevco and registered on the registration statement may be immediately resold. The registration statement was declared effective on August 16, 2022. 
 We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. 
 We may also in the future sell additional shares of preferred stock, including shares of Series A Preferred Stock, on terms that may differ from those we have previously issued. Such shares could rank on parity with or, subject to the voting rights referred to above (with respect to issuances of new series of preferred stock), senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution rights or rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution. The subsequent issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or the creation and subsequent issuance of additional classes of preferred stock on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, could dilute the interests of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Stock. Any issuance of preferred stock that is senior to the Series A Preferred Stock would not only dilute the interests of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, but also could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Furthermore, subject to compliance with the Securities Act or exemptions therefrom, employees who have received Class A common stock as equity awards may also sell their shares into the public market. 
 We have issued preferred stock and may continue to do so, and the terms of such preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. 
 Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. Through December 31, 2022, we have issued an aggregate of 3,567,543 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The terms of the preferred stock we offer or sell could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock, such as the Series A Preferred Stock, could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the fiduciary duties of one of our directors and certain of our affiliates and restricts the remedies available to our stockholders for actions taken by our Founder or certain of our affiliates that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that we renounce any interest in existing and future investments in other entities by, or the business opportunities of, NuDevco Partners, LLC, NuDevco Partners Holdings, LLC and W. Keith Maxwell III, or any of their officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than a director or officer who is presented an opportunity solely in his capacity as a director or officer). Because of this provision, these persons and entities have no obligation to offer us 
 36 

Table of Contents 

those investments or opportunities that are offered to them in any capacity other than solely as an officer or director. If one of these persons or entities pursues a business opportunity instead of presenting the opportunity to us, we will not have any recourse against such person or entity for a breach of fiduciary duty. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock represent perpetual equity interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock on the date the Series A Preferred Stock becomes redeemable by us or on any particular date afterwards. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock represents a perpetual equity interest in us, and the securities have no maturity or mandatory redemption date and are not redeemable at the option of investors under any circumstances. As a result, unlike our indebtedness, the Series A Preferred Stock will not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Preferred Stock for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock will rank junior to all our current and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility) and other liabilities. The Series A Preferred Stock will also rank junior to any other preferred stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock we may issue in the future with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is not rated. 
 We have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock, and the Series A Preferred Stock may never be rated. It is possible, however, that one or more rating agencies might independently determine to assign a rating to the Series A Preferred Stock or that we may elect to obtain a rating of the Series A Preferred Stock in the future. In addition, we may elect to issue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating. If any ratings are assigned to the Series A Preferred Stock in the future or if we issue other securities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn, could adversely affect the market for or the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and such ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and any future rating of the Series A Preferred Stock may not reflect all risks related to us and our business, or the structure or market value of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The Change of Control Conversion Right may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us. 
 The Change of Control Conversion Right of the Series A Preferred Stock provided in the Certificate of Designation may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain of our change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price of such equity securities or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests. 
 Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates under the floating dividend rate of our Series A Preferred Stock. 
 LIBOR is a basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on loans and payment rates on other financial instruments. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue at a floating rate equal to the sum of: (a) Three-Month LIBOR Rate as calculated on each applicable determination date, plus (b) 6.578 . 
 In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intended to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time, if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different reference rates will develop. It is impossible to predict the effect these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other 
 37 

Table of Contents 

reforms to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, other benchmark rates or floating rate debt instruments. 
 Although our Series A Preferred Stock contain LIBOR alternative provisions and the use of alternative reference rates, new methods of calculating LIBOR or other reforms could cause the dividend rate on our Series A Preferred Stock to be materially different than expected, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations, and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Class A common stock. 
 A substantial increase in the Three-Month LIBOR Rate or an alternative rate could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Class A common stock. 
 If we do not repurchase or redeem our Series A Preferred Stock on or after April 15, 2022, a substantial increase in the Three-Month LIBOR Rate (if it then exists), or a substantial increase in the alternative reference rate, could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. An increase in the dividends payable on our Series A Preferred Stock would negatively impact dividends on our Class A common stock. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate sources of capital to repurchase or redeem the Series A Preferred Stock on or after April 15, 2022. If we are unable to repurchase or redeem the Series A Preferred Stock and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Class A common stock is negatively impacted, the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock and Class A common stock could be materially adversely impacted. 
 We may not have sufficient earnings and profits in order for dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock to be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 The dividends payable by us on the Series A Preferred Stock may exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this occurs, it will result in the amount of the dividends that exceed such earnings and profits being treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes first as a return of capital to the extent of the beneficial owner s adjusted tax basis in the Series A Preferred Stock, and the excess, if any, over such adjusted tax basis as gain from the sale or exchange of property, which generally results in capital gain. Such treatment will generally be unfavorable for corporate beneficial owners and may also be unfavorable to certain other beneficial owners. 
 You may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion rate of the Series A Preferred Stock even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution. 
 The Conversion Rate as defined in the Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. A failure to adjust (or to adjust adequately) the Conversion Rate after an event that increases your proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to you. If you are a non-U.S. holder, any deemed dividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30 rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 We are a controlled company under NASDAQ Global Select Market rules, and as such we are entitled to an exemption from certain corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ Global Market corporate governance requirements.

Further, our ability to pay dividends will depend on certain factors including the performance of our business, cash flows, RCE counts and the margins we receive.

In this Annual Report, the terms Via," "Via Renewables," "Spark Energy," Company, we, us and our refer collectively to Via Renewables, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are an independent retail energy services company founded in 1999 that provides residential and commercial customers in competitive markets across the United States with an alternative choice for natural gas and electricity. We purchase our natural gas and electricity supply from a variety of wholesale providers and bill our customers monthly for the delivery of natural gas and electricity based on their consumption at either a fixed or variable price. Natural gas and electricity are then distributed to our customers by local regulated utility companies through their existing infrastructure. As of December 31, 2022, we operated in 102 utility service territories across 19 states and the District of Columbia. 
 Our business consists of two operating segments: 
 
 Retail Electricity Segment . In this segment, we purchase electricity supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparties and ISOs and supply electricity to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price and variable-price contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 76 , 81 and 83 , respectively, of our retail revenues were derived from the sale of electricity. 
 
 Retail Natural Gas Segment . In this segment, we purchase natural gas supply through physical and financial transactions with market counterparties and supply natural gas to residential and commercial consumers pursuant to fixed-price and variable-price contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 24 , 19 and 17 , respectively, of our retail revenues were derived from the sale of natural gas. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On March 20, 2023, our shareholders approved a proposal for a reverse stock split Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock at a ratio between 1 for 2 and 1 for 5, to be determined by the Company s Chief Executive Office or Chief Financial Officer. Effective March 21, 2023, we effected the Reverse Stock Split at a ratio of 1 to 5 shares of common stock, which began trading on a post-split basis on March 22, 2023. All shares and per share amounts in this report have been retrospectively restated to effect the stock split effective March 21, 2023. 

Drivers of Our Business 
 
 The success of our business and our profitability are impacted by a number of drivers, the most significant of which are discussed below. 
 
 Customer Growth 
 
 Customer growth is a key driver of our operations. Our ability to acquire customers organically or by acquisition is important to our success as we experience ongoing customer attrition. Our customer growth strategy includes 
 43 

Table of Contents 

growing organically through traditional sales channels complemented by customer portfolio and business acquisitions. 
 
 We measure our number of customers using residential customer equivalents ("RCEs"). The following table shows our RCEs by segment as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 RCEs: December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Retail Electricity 201 298 303 Retail Natural Gas 130 110 97 Total Retail 331 408 400

 The geographical locations noted above include the following states: 
 
 New England - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire; 
 Mid-Atlantic - Delaware, Maryland (including the District of Columbia), New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania; 
 Midwest - Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio; and 
 Southwest - Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Texas. 
 
 Our organic sales strategies are designed to offer competitive pricing, price certainty, and/or green product offerings to residential and commercial customers. We manage growth on a market-by-market basis by developing price curves in each of the markets we serve and comparing the market prices to the price offered by the local regulated utility. We then determine if there is an opportunity in a particular market based on our ability to create a competitive product on economic terms that provides customer value and satisfies our profitability objectives. We develop marketing campaigns using a combination of sales channels. Our marketing team continuously evaluates the effectiveness of each customer acquisition channel and makes adjustments in order to achieve desired targets. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we added approximately 67,000 RCEs through our various organic sales channels. This amount was significantly lower than historical periods primarily due to the slower ramp up of the door-to-door and telemarketing activities after the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, a reduction in targeted organic customer acquisitions as we focused our efforts to improve our organic sales channels, including vendor selection and sales quality, and the extreme price volatility we experienced throughout the year. As these orders have expired, and consumers adjust to price volatility we experienced throughout the year, we expect our customer growth to return to historical levels. However, we are unable to predict the ultimate effect on our organic sales, financial results, cash flows, and liquidity at this time. 
 
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain public utility commissions, regulatory agencies, and other governmental authorities in most of our markets continue to maintain orders prohibiting energy services companies from door-to- 
 44 

Table of Contents 

door marketing and in some cases telemarketing during the pandemic, which has restricted some of the methods we have historically used to market for organic sales . In response, we have focused on development of products and channels, partners for web sales, as well as accelerating its telemarketing sales quality programs. In November 2020 , we began active door-to-door marketing activities in certain markets where not prohibited by states' COVID-19 restrictions. 
 
 We also acquire companies and portfolios of customers through both external and affiliated channels. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we added approximately 18,700 RCEs as a result of a series of asset purchase agreements entered in August 2022 . Refer to Note 16 Customer Acquisitions for further discussion. Our ability to realize returns from acquisitions that are acceptable to us is dependent on our ability to successfully identify, negotiate, finance and integrate acquisitions. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions during the remainder of 2023. 
 
 RCE Activity 
 
 The following table shows our RCE activity during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 (In thousands) Retail Electricity Retail Natural Gas Total Net Annual Increase (Decrease) December 31, 2019 533 139 672 Additions 38 8 46 Attrition (268) (50) (318) December 31, 2020 303 97 400 (40) Additions 110 47 157 Attrition (115) (34) (149) December 31, 2021 298 110 408 2 Additions 40 46 86 Attrition (137) (26) (163) December 31, 2022 201 130 331 (19) 
 
 Customer attrition occurs primarily as a result of: (i) customer initiated switches; (ii) residential moves (iii) disconnection resulting from customer payment defaults and (iv) pro-active non-renewal of contracts. Average monthly attrition rates during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 
 Year Ended Quarter Ended December 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 2020 5.0 7.7 3.0 3.5 5.7 2021 3.3 3.4 2.4 3.3 4.2 2022 3.8 4.2 4.0 3.1 3.7 
 
 In 2020, our attrition exceeded customer additions primarily due to the non-renewal of certain larger C I customer contracts and limitations on our ability to sell through door-to-door and telemarketing activities as a result of orders by regulatory agencies and governmental authorities' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Customer attrition during the year ended December 31, 2021 was lower compared to the prior year due to our pro-active non-renewal of some of our lower-margin large commercial contracts in prior years, which did not re-occur in 2021. 
 
 Customer attrition for the year ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the prior year due to the sharp increase in commodity prices across the industry.

Customer Acquisition Costs 
 
 Managing customer acquisition costs is a key component of our profitability. Customer acquisition costs are those costs related to obtaining customers organically and do not include the cost of acquiring customers through acquisitions, which are recorded as customer relationships. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, customer acquisition costs were as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Customer Acquisition Costs 5,870 1,415 1,513 
 
 We strive to maintain a disciplined approach to recovery of our customer acquisition costs within a 12 month period. We capitalize and amortize our customer acquisition costs over a two year period, which is based on our estimate of the expected average length of a customer relationship. We factor in the recovery of customer acquisition costs in determining which markets we enter and the pricing of our products in those markets. Accordingly, our results are significantly influenced by our customer acquisition costs. Changes in customer acquisition costs from period to period reflect our focus on growing organically versus growth through acquisitions. We are currently focused on growing through organic sales channels; however, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire customers through acquisitions and pursue such acquisitions when it makes sense economically or strategically. 
 
 As described above, certain public utility commissions, regulatory agencies, and other governmental authorities in all of our markets have issued orders that impact the way we have historically acquired customers, such as door to door marketing. Our reduced marketing resulted in significantly reduced customer acquisition costs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to historical amounts. 
 
 Our gradual increase of marketing efforts as restrictions have been lifted resulted in increased marketing and customer acquisition costs, although still lower compared to historical amounts. Customer acquisition costs with respect to door to door marketing returned back to pre-Covid-19 historic levels in 2022. 
 
 Customer Credit Risk 
 
 Approximately 59 of our revenues are derived from customers in utilities where customer credit risk is borne by the utility in exchange for a discount on amounts billed. Where we have customer credit risk, we record bad debt based on an estimate of uncollectible amounts. Our bad debt expense on non-POR revenues was as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Total Non-POR Bad Debt as Percent of Revenue 3.0 0.2 1.6 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced higher bad debt expense versus 2021 primarily due to the Company increasing sales activities in non-POR markets and the impact of increased defaults on customer billings, in part due to higher natural gas and electricity prices. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 59 , 59 and 64 , respectively, of our retail revenues were collected through POR programs where substantially all of our credit risk was with local regulated utility companies. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, all of these local regulated utility companies had investment grade ratings. During these same periods, we paid these local regulated utilities a weighted average discount of approximately 0.9 , 0.9 and 1.2 , respectively, of total revenues for customer credit risk protection. 
 
 Weather Conditions 
 
 46 

Table of Contents 

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for natural gas and electricity and affect the prices of energy commodities. Our hedging strategy is based on forecasted customer energy usage, which can vary substantially as a result of weather patterns deviating from historical norms. We are particularly sensitive to this variability in our residential customer segment where energy usage is highly sensitive to weather conditions that impact heating and cooling demand. 
 
 Our risk management policies direct that we hedge substantially all of our forecasted demand, which is typically hedged to long-term normal weather patterns. We also attempt to add additional protection through hedging from time to time to protect us from potential volatility in markets where we have historically experienced higher exposure to extreme weather conditions. Because we attempt to match commodity purchases to anticipated demand, unanticipated changes in weather patterns can have a significant impact on our operating results and cash flows from period to period. 
 
 Winter Storm Uri 
 
 During the first quarter of 2021, the U.S. experienced winter storm Uri, an unprecedented storm bringing extreme cold temperatures to the central U.S., including Texas. As a result of increased power demand for customers across the state of Texas and power generation disruptions during the weather event, power and ancillary costs in the ERCOT service area reached or exceeded maximum allowed clearing prices. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a net loss of approximately 64.4 million as a direct result of winter storm Uri. Although our hedge position was 120 of our forecasted demand in Texas for the month of February, we were still required to purchase power at unprecedented prices for an extended period of time during the storm. These price caps imposed by ERCOT for the duration of the storm and beyond have never been experienced in any deregulated market in which we serve. The policies imposed on the electricity markets by ERCOT related to pricing resulted in overall negative impact on our electricity unit margin for 2021. In June 2022, we received 9.6 million from ERCOT related to PURA Subchapter N Financing, resulting in a positive impact on our electricity unit margin in 2022. 
 
 Asset Optimization 
 
 Our asset optimization opportunities primarily arise during the winter heating season when demand for natural gas is typically at its highest. Given the opportunistic nature of these activities and because we account for these activities using the mark to market method of accounting, we experience variability in our earnings from our asset optimization activities from year to year. 
 
 Net asset optimization resulted in a loss of 2.3 million, a loss of 4.2 million and a loss of 0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
 
 We use the Non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin to evaluate and measure our operating results. These measures for the three years ended December 31, 2022 were as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2) 
 51,793 80,657 106,634 Retail Gross Margin (3)(4) 
 114,815 132,534 196,473 
 (1) Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a 60.0 million add back related to winter storm Uri and also includes a deduction of 2.2 million non-recurring legal settlement related to an add back in 2019. See discussion below. 
 (2) Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a deduction of 5.2 million related to proceeds received under an ERCOT (winter storm Uri) securitization mechanism in June 2022. See further discussion below. 
 (3) Retail Gross Margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a 0.5 million reduction related to the winter storm Uri credit settlements received and year ended December 31, 2021 includes a 64.4 million add back related to winter storm Uri. See discussion below. 
 (4) Retail Gross Margin for year ended December 31, 2022 includes a deduction of 9.6 million related to proceeds received under an ERCOT (winter storm Uri) securitization mechanism in June 2022. See further discussion below. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA . We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA less (i) customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period, plus or minus (ii) net (loss) gain on derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments, plus (iv) non-cash compensation expense, and (v) other non-cash and non-recurring operating items. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before the provision for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. This conforms to the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA in our Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 We deduct all current period customer acquisition costs (representing spending for organic customer acquisitions) in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred, even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years. We do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 We deduct our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments. We also deduct non-cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long-term incentive plan due to the non-cash nature of the expense. 
 
 We adjust from time to time other non-cash or unusual and/or infrequent charges due to either their non-cash nature or their infrequency. We have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. We will continue this historical approach, but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre-tax financial loss of 64.9 million due to winter storm Uri, as described above. This loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub-freezing temperatures across Texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ERCOT. We believe this event is unusual, infrequent, and non-recurring in nature. 
 
 As our Senior Credit Facility is considered a material agreement and Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of our material covenants, we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of our financial condition and/or liquidity. Our lenders under our Senior Credit Facility allowed 60.0 million of the 64.9 million pre-tax storm loss incurred in the first quarter of 2021 to be added back as a non-recurring item in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our Debt Covenant Calculations. We received a 0.4 million credit from ERCOT for winter storm related losses during the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a net pre-tax storm loss of 64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In June 2022, we received 9.6 million from ERCOT related to PURA Subchapter N Securitization financing. For consistent presentation of the financial impact of winter storm Uri, 5.2 million of the 9.6 million is reflected as non-recurring items reducing Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following: 
 
 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 
 the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends; 
 our ability to fund capital expenditures (including customer acquisition costs) and incur and service debt; and 
 our compliance with financial debt covenants. (Refer to Note 9 "Debt" in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for discussion of the material terms of our Senior Credit Facility, including the covenant requirements for our Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Maximum Total Leverage Ratio, and Maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio.) 
 
 The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to these GAAP measures for each of the periods indicated.

 Retail Gross Margin. We define Retail Gross Margin as gross profit less (i) net asset optimization revenues (expenses), (ii) net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments and (iv) gains (losses) from non-recurring events (including non-recurring market volatility). Retail Gross Margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity segments. As an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance, Retail Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, gross profit, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business's operating performance. 
 
 We have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of Retail Gross Margin. We will continue this historical approach, but during the first quarter of 2021 we added back the 64.9 million net financial loss incurred related to winter storm Uri, as described above, in the calculation of Retail Gross Margin because the extremity of the Texas storm combined with the impact of unprecedented pricing mechanisms ordered by ERCOT is considered unusual, infrequent, and non-recurring in nature. In June 2022, we received 9.6 million from ERCOT related to PURA Subchapter N Securitization financing. The 9.6 million is reflected as a non-recurring item reducing Retail Gross Margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 for consistent presentation of the financial impacts of winter storm Uri. 
 
 The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Retail Gross Margin is gross profit. The following table presents a reconciliation of Retail Gross Margin to gross profit for each of the periods indicated.

 Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin should not be considered as alternatives to gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Retail Gross Margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect gross profit, and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision-making process.

 Total Revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 460.5 million, an increase of approximately 67.0 million, or 17 , from approximately 393.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in electricity unit revenue per MWh and higher natural gas volumes sold as a result of a larger natural gas customer book in 2022 as compared to 2021. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 161.4 million, or 29 , from approximately 554.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in electricity and natural gas volumes as a result of a smaller customer book in 2021 as compared to 2020, partially offset by an increase in electricity unit revenue per MWh.

Analysis of the impact of changes in prices and volumes between the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: 
 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Change in electricity volumes sold (30.5) (156.3) Change in natural gas volumes sold 25.6 (21.1) Change in electricity unit revenue per MWh 61.4 16.6 Change in electricity unit revenue per MWh - winter storm Uri (0.9) 0.9 Change in natural gas unit revenue per MMBtu 9.5 2.0 Change in net asset optimization (expense) revenue 1.9 (3.5) Change in total revenues 67.0 (161.4) 
 
 Retail Cost of Revenues . Total retail cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 357.1 million, an increase of approximately 33.9 million, or 10 , from approximately 323.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in electricity and natural gas supply costs due to a higher commodity price environment in 2022, and a change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio, offset by electricity supply costs related to winter storm Uri in 2021 that did not re-occur in 2022 and a winter storm Uri credit received from ERCOT in 2022. Total retail cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 21.4 million, or 6 , from approximately 344.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in electricity and natural gas volumes as a result of a smaller customer book in 2021 as compared to 2020, offset by an increase in electricity and natural gas unit cost, as well as an increase in electricity supply costs due to winter storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021. 
 
 Analysis of the impact of changes in prices and volumes between the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows: 
 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 Change in electricity volumes sold (21.4) (107.8) Change in natural gas volumes sold 13.2 (9.2) Change in electricity unit cost per MWh 65.6 15.4 Change in electricity unit cost per MWh - winter storm Uri (74.8) 65.3 Change in natural gas unit cost per MMBtu 26.2 6.8 Change in value of retail derivative portfolio 25.1 8.1 Change in retail cost of revenues 33.9 (21.4) 
 
 General and Administrative Expense . General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 61.9 million, an increase of approximately 17.6 million, or 40 , as compared to 44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to higher employee costs and higher bad debt expense in 2022 and lower employee costs in 2021 due to employee retention credits related to CARES Act that did not re-occur in 2022. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 46.4 million, or 51 , as compared to 90.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower employee costs, lower bad debt expense in 2021 due to improved collection efforts and lower legal costs. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense . Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 16.7 million, a decrease of approximately 4.9 million, or 23 , from approximately 21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the decreased amortization expense associated with customer relationship intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 9.2 million, or 30 , from approximately 30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the decreased amortization expense associated with customer relationship intangibles.

Customer Acquisition Cost . Customer acquisition cost for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 5.9 million, an increase of approximately 4.5 million, or 321 , from approximately 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and reflected a return to more historical levels. The low customer acquisition cost in 2021 was primarily due to a limitation on our ability to use door-to-door marketing as a result of COVID-19 and a reduction in targeted organic customer acquisitions as we focused our efforts to improve our organic sales channels, including vendor selection and sales quality. Customer acquisition cost for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 0.1 million, or 6 from approximately 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to limitation on our door-to-door marketing as a result of COVID-19 during most of 2021.

 Retail Electricity Segment 
 Total revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 352.8 million, an increase of approximately 30.2 million, or 9 , from approximately 322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was largely due to higher electricity prices, resulting in an increase of 61.4 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in volumes, which resulted in a decrease of 30.5 million, and a decrease of 0.9 million related to electricity revenue due to winter storm Uri in 2021 that did not re-occur in 2022. Total revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 138.8 million, or 30 , from approximately 461.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was largely due to lower volumes sold, resulting in a decrease of 156.3 million as a result of a smaller customer book in 2021. This decrease was partially offset by higher weighted average electricity rates due to our customer mix shifting away from large commercial customers, which resulted in an increase of 16.6 million and an increase of 0.9 million related to electricity revenue due to winter storm Uri. 
 Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 275.7 million, a decrease of approximately 9.1 million, or 3 , from approximately 284.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in supply costs of 74.8 million related to winter storm Uri in 2021 that did not re-occur in 2022 (which includes a credit of 9.6 million related to winter storm Uri received in 2022 from ERCOT) and electricity volumes sold resulting in a decrease of 21.4 million. This was offset by an increase in electricity costs of 65.6 million due to higher commodity price environment in 2022 and by an increase of 21.5 million due to a change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used in hedging.

Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Electricity Segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 21.2 million, or 7 , from approximately 306.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in volumes, resulting in a decrease of 107.8 million. This was offset by increased electricity supply costs, which resulted in an increase in retail cost of revenues of 15.4 million and increased supply cost of 65.3 million related to winter storm Uri. Additionally, there was an increase of 5.9 million due to a change in the value of our retail derivative portfolio used in hedging. 
 Retail gross margin for the Retail Electricity Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 82.7 million, a decrease of approximately 13.3 million, or 14 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2021 decreased approximately 47.2 million or 33 as compared to December 31, 2020 as indicated in the table below (in millions).

 Unit margins were negatively impacted in 2022 compared to prior year primarily as a result of the higher electricity cost due to higher commodity price environment in 2022. Unit margins were flat in 2021 compared to the prior year. 
 The volumes of electricity sold decreased from 2,686,083 MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2,433,906 MWh for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a smaller customer book in 2022. The volumes of electricity sold decreased from 4,049,543 MWh for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2,686,083 MWh for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a smaller C I customer book in 2021 as compared to 2020. 
 Retail Natural Gas Segment 
 Total revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 110.1 million, an increase of approximately 35.0 million, or 47 , from approximately 75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes of 25.6 million, and higher rates, which resulted in an increase in total revenues of 9.5 million. Total revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by approximately 19.1 million, or 20 , from approximately 94.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in volumes of 21.1 million, offset by higher rates, which resulted in an increase in total revenues of 2.0 million. 
 Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 81.4 million, an increase of approximately 43.0 million, or 112 , from approximately 38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher supply costs of 26.2 million, higher volumes of 13.2 million, and an increase of 3.6 million due to change in the fair value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging. Retail cost of revenues for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased approximately 0.2 million, or less than 1 , from approximately 38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of 9.2 million, offset by higher supply costs of 6.8 million, and an increase of 2.2 million due to change in the fair value of our retail derivative portfolio used for hedging. 
 Retail gross margin for the Retail Natural Gas Segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 32.1 million, a decrease of approximately 4.4 million, or 12 from approximately 36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and 2021 decreased approximately 16.7 million or 31 from approximately 53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as indicated in the table below (in millions).

 Unit margins were negatively impacted in 2022 compared to prior year primarily as a result of the higher natural cost supply costs due to higher commodity price environment in 2022. Unit margins were negatively impacted in 2021 compared to prior year as a result of higher commodity prices and lower volumes sold resulting in higher per unit cost . 
 The volumes of natural gas sold increased from 8,611,285 MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 11,558,952 MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a larger customer book in 2022 compared to 2021. The volumes of natural gas sold decreased from 11,100,446 MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 8,611,285 MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to milder-than-normal weather in 2021 compared to prior year and smaller customer book throughout most of 2021 compared to 2020. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our financial commitments, finance current operations, fund organic growth and/or acquisitions, service debt and pay dividends. Our liquidity requirements fluctuate with our level of customer acquisition costs, acquisitions, collateral posting requirements on our derivative instruments portfolio, distributions, the effects of the timing between the settlement of payables and receivables, including the effect of bad debts, weather conditions, and our general working capital needs for ongoing operations. Estimating our liquidity requirements is highly dependent on then-current market conditions, forward prices for natural gas and electricity, market volatility and our then existing capital structure and requirements. 
 
 We believe that cash generated from operations and our available liquidity sources will be sufficient to sustain current operations and to pay required taxes. Our ability to pay dividends to the holders of the Class A common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock in the future will ultimately depend on our RCE count, margins, profitability and cash flow, and the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility.

 Borrowings and related posting of letters of credit under our Senior Credit Facility are subject to material variations on a seasonal basis due to the timing of commodity purchases to satisfy natural gas inventory requirements and to meet customer demands during periods of peak usage. Additionally, borrowings are subject to borrowing base and covenant restrictions.

Additionally, borrowings are subject to borrowing base and covenant restrictions. 

Cash Flows 
 Our cash flows were as follows for the respective periods (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities 16,207 12,702 91,831 Net cash used in by investing activities (6,871) (6,510) (2,154) Net cash used in financing activities (49,305) (2,556) (75,661) 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities . Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 3.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of higher net income in 2022 coupled with other changes in working capital, non-recurring winter storm Uri related costs of 64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which did not re-occur in 2022, and a 9.6 million credit received in the year ended December 31, 2022 from ERCOT related to winter storm Uri. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 79.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of the non-recurring winter storm Uri related costs of 64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 coupled with other changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities . Cash flows used in investing activities increased by 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of increases related to customer acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by 4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of increased capital spending and acquisition of customers for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities . Cash flows used in financing activities increased by 46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to an increased net paydown of our Senior Credit Facility of 70.0 million, offset by an increase in sub-debt borrowing of 20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by 73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to an increased net borrowing of 58.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility and a decrease in distributions to noncontrolling unitholders of 12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Senior Credit Facility 
 
 On June 30, 2022, we entered into the Senior Credit Facility with Woodforest National Bank, as administrative agent, swing bank, swap bank, issuing bank, joint-lead arranger, sole bookrunner and syndication agent, BOKF, NA (d/b/a/ Bank of Texas), as joint-lead arranger and issuing bank, and the other financial institutions party thereto, which replaced our prior credit agreement. The Senior Credit Facility allows us to borrow up to 195.0 million on a revolving basis in the form of working capital loans, loans to fund acquisitions, swingline loans and letters of credit. The Senior Credit Facility expires on June 30, 2025. The Senior Credit Facility revised the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Maximum Senior Secured Leverage Ratio under our prior credit agreement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total commitments of 195.0 million under our Senior Credit Facility, of which 134.4 million was outstanding, including 34.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.

Table of Contents 

For a description of the terms and conditions of our Senior Credit Facility, including descriptions of the interest rate, commitment fee, covenants and terms of default, please see Note 9 "Debt" in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility. Based upon existing covenants as of December 31, 2022, we had availability to borrow up to 38.2 million under the Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company has experienced compressed gross profit due to an extreme elevation of commodity costs during 2022, impacting calculated Adjusted EBITDA, a primary component of the financial covenants described above. The Company is actively working to manage the expected impact of continued gross profit compression due to elevated commodity costs on financial covenant compliance. Maintaining compliance with our covenants under our Senior Credit Facility may impact our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 Amended and Restated Subordinated Debt Facility 
 
 In connection with entering into the Senior Credit Facility, we entered into an amended and restated subordinated promissory note (the Subordinated Debt Facility ), which allows us to draw advances in increments of no less than 1.0 million per advance up to 25.0 million through January 31, 2026. Borrowings are at the discretion of Retailco. Advances thereunder accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2.0 from the date of the advance. 
 
 Although we may use the Subordinated Debt Facility from time to time to enhance short term liquidity, we do not view the Subordinated Debt Facility as a material source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, there was 20 million outstanding borrowings under the Subordinated Debt Facility, and availability to borrow up to 5.0 million under the Subordinated Debt Facility. See Note 9 "Debt" for further information regarding the extension of the Subordinated Debt Facility. 
 
 Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Repayment of Current Portion of Senior Credit Facility 
 
 Our Senior Credit Facility, matures in June 2025, and thus, no amounts are due currently. However, due to the revolving nature of the facility, excess cash available is generally used to reduce the balance outstanding, which at December 31, 2022 was 100.0 million. The current variable interest rate on the facility at December 31, 2022 was 7.83 . 
 
 Customer Acquisitions 
 
 Our customer acquisition strategy consists of customer growth obtained through organic customer additions as well as opportunistic acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we spent a total of 5.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively, on organic customer acquisitions. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Our capital requirements each year are relatively low and generally consist of minor purchases of equipment or information system upgrades and improvements. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 included approximately 2.2 million related to information systems improvements. 
 
 Dividends and Distributions 
 
 59 

Table of Contents 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid dividends to holders of our Class A common stock of 3.625 per share or 11.5 million in the aggregate. In order to pay our stated dividends to holders of our Class A common stock, our subsidiary, Spark HoldCo is required to make corresponding distributions to holders of Class B common stock (our non-controlling interest holders). As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2022, Spark HoldCo made distributions of 14.5 million to our non-controlling interest holders related to the dividend payments to our Class A shareholders. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid 7.6 million of dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and as of December 31, 2022, we had accrued 2.4 million related to dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, which we paid on January 17, 2023. The Series A Preferred Stock will accrue dividends at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) Three-Month LIBOR (if it then exists), or an alternative reference rate as of the applicable determination date and (b) 6.578 , based on the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we declared dividends of 8.0 million in the aggregate on our Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 On January 18, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of 0.90625 per share to holders of our Class A common stock and 0.71298 per share for the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends on Class A common stock will be paid on March 15, 2023 to holders of record on March 1, 2023 and Series A Preferred Stock dividends will be paid on April 17, 2023 to holders of record on April 1, 2023. 
 
 Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon our operations, our financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities, the performance of our business, cash flows, RCE counts and the margins we receive, as well as restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility. Increases in interest rates impact the amount of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors may be required to reduce or eliminate quarterly cash distributions, including the quarterly dividends to the holders of the Class A common stock and/or Series A Preferred Stock. Even if we are permitted to pay such dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, our Board of Directors may elect to reduce or eliminate the dividends on the Class A common stock and Series A Preferred Stock to maintain cash balances for operations or for other reasons. Similarly, even if our business generates cash in excess of our current annual dividend, we may reinvest such excess cash flows in our business and not increase the dividends payable to holders of our Class A common stock. As of April 15, 2022, we have the option to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Revenue Recognition and Retail Cost of Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of natural gas and electricity to retail customers. We also record revenues from sales of natural gas and electricity to wholesale counterparties, including affiliates. Revenues are recognized when the natural gas or electricity is delivered. Similarly, cost of revenues is recognized when the commodity is delivered. 
 
 In each period, natural gas and electricity that has been delivered but not billed by period is estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter read and are provided by the utility. Volume estimates are based on forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage by class. Unbilled revenues are calculated by multiplying these volume estimates by the applicable rate by customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed. 
 
 The cost of natural gas and electricity for sale to retail customers is similarly based on estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. In estimating supply volumes, we consider the effects of historical customer volumes, weather factors and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees, where applicable, are estimated using the same method used for sales to retail customers. In addition, other load related costs, such as ISO fees, ancillary services and renewable energy credits are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial utility data. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as retail cost of revenues in the applicable reporting period. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed. 
 
 Accounts Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company conducts business in many utility service markets where the local regulated utility purchases our receivables, and then becomes responsible for billing the customer and collecting payment from the customer POR programs ). These POR programs result in substantially all of the Company s credit risk being linked to the applicable utility, which generally has an investment-grade rating, and not to the end-use customer. The Company monitors the financial condition of each utility and currently believes its receivables are collectible. 
 
 In markets that do not offer POR programs or when the Company chooses to directly bill its customers, certain receivables are billed and collected by the Company. The Company bears the credit risk on these accounts and records an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect any losses due to non-payment by customers. The Company s customers are individually insignificant and geographically dispersed in these markets. The Company writes off customer balances when it believes that amounts are no longer collectible and when it has exhausted all means to collect these receivables. 
 
 62 

Table of Contents 

For trade accounts receivables, the Company accrues an allowance for doubtful accounts by business segment by pooling customer accounts receivables based on similar risk characteristics, such as customer type, geography, aging analysis, payment terms, and related macroeconomic factors. Expected credit loss exposure is evaluated for each of our accounts receivables pools. Expected credits losses are established using a model that considers historical collections experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the accounts receivable is deemed to be uncollectible. 
 
 We assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts through review of an aging of customer accounts receivable and general economic conditions in the markets that we serve. 
 
 Derivative Instruments 
 
 We enter into both physical and financial contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas and apply the fair value requirements of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. 
 
 Our derivative instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting requirements and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivative instruments representing unrealized gains are reported as derivative assets while derivative instruments representing unrealized losses are reported as derivative liabilities. We offset amounts in the consolidated balance sheets for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty where we have a master netting arrangement. 
 
 To manage our retail business, we hold derivative instruments that are not for trading purposes and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Changes in the fair value of and amounts realized upon settlement of derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are recognized in retail costs of revenues. 
 
 As part of our asset optimization activities, we manage a portfolio of commodity derivative instruments held for trading purposes. Changes in fair value of and amounts realized upon settlements of derivatives instruments held for trading purposes are recognized in earnings in net asset optimization revenues. 
 
 We have entered into other energy-related contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or for which we made a normal purchase, normal sale election and are therefore not accounted for at fair value. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 As noted above, Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the assets of businesses. The goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 is associated with both our Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electricity reporting units. We determine our reporting units by identifying each unit that is engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, has operating results regularly reviewed by the segment manager for purposes of resource allocation and performance assessment, and has discrete financial information. 
 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely, but no less often than annually. Our annual assessment, absent a triggering event is as of October 31 of each year. On October 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill in accordance with guidance from ASC 350, in which we compared our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying values, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would recognize a goodwill impairment loss for the amount by which the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value. All of these assessments and calculations, including the determination of whether a triggering event has occurred to undertake an assessment of goodwill involve a high degree of judgment. 
 
 We completed our annual assessment of goodwill impairment at October 31, 2022, and the test indicated no impairment.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
 
 The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for each tax year. In addition, the Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized. 
 
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. All of these determinations involve estimates and assumptions. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Refer to Note 2 "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including regulatory and other matters. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For a discussion of the status of current legal and regulatory matters, see Note 13 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices and interest rates, as well as counterparty credit risk. We employ established risk management policies and procedures to manage, measure, and limit our exposure to these risks. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We hedge and procure our energy requirements from various wholesale energy markets, including both physical and financial markets and through short and long-term contracts. Our financial results are largely dependent on the margin we are able to realize between the wholesale purchase price of natural gas and electricity plus related costs and the retail sales price we charge our customers for these commodities. We actively manage our commodity price risk by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from fixed-price forecasted sales and purchases of natural gas and electricity in connection with our retail energy operations. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, as well as over-the-counter markets. These contracts have varying terms and durations, which range from a few days to several years, depending on the instrument. We also utilize similar derivative contracts in connection with our asset optimization activities to attempt to generate incremental gross margin by effecting transactions in markets where we have a retail presence. Generally, any such instruments that are entered into to support our retail electricity and natural gas business are categorized as having been entered into for non-trading purposes, and instruments entered into for any other purpose are categorized as having been entered into for trading purposes. 
 Our net (loss)/gain on our non-trading derivative instruments, net of cash settlements, was (18.7) million and 6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 
 We have adopted risk management policies to measure and limit market risk associated with our fixed-price portfolio and our hedging activities. For additional information regarding our commodity price risk and our risk management policies, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report. 
 We measure the commodity risk of our non-trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis on our net open position. As of December 31, 2022, our Gas Non-Trading Fixed Price Open Position (hedges net of retail load) was a short position of 397,632 MMBtu. An increase of 10 in the market prices (NYMEX) from their December 31, 2022 levels would have decreased the fair market value of our net non-trading energy portfolio by 0.1 million. Likewise, a decrease of 10 in the market prices (NYMEX) from their December 31, 2022 levels would have increased the fair market value of our non-trading energy derivatives by 0.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, our Electricity Non-Trading Fixed Price Open Position (hedges net of retail load) was a long position of 197,319 MWhs. An increase of 10 in the forward market prices from their December 31, 2022 levels would have increased the fair market value of our net non-trading energy portfolio by 1.2 million. Likewise, a decrease of 10 in the forward market prices from their December 31, 2022 levels would have decreased the fair market value of our non-trading energy derivatives by 1.2 million. 
 Credit Risk 
 In many of the utility services territories where we conduct business, Purchase of Receivables ("POR") programs have been established, whereby the local regulated utility purchases our receivables, and becomes responsible for billing the customer and collecting payment from the customer. This service results in substantially all of our credit risk being with the utility and not to our end-use customer in these territories. Approximately 59 , 59 and 64 of our retail revenues were derived from territories in which substantially all of our credit risk was with local regulated utility companies as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, all of which had investment grade ratings as of such date. During the same period, we paid these local regulated utilities a weighted average discount of approximately 0.9 , 0.9 and 1.2 , respectively, of total revenues for customer credit risk protection. In certain of the POR markets in which we operate, the utilities limit their collections exposure by retaining the ability to transfer a delinquent account back to us for collection when collections are past due for a specified period. 
 65 

Table of Contents 

If our collection efforts are unsuccessful, we return the account to the local regulated utility for termination of service. Under these service programs, we are exposed to credit risk related to payment for services rendered during the time between when the customer is transferred to us by the local regulated utility and the time we return the customer to the utility for termination of service, which is generally one to two billing periods. We may also realize a loss on fixed-price customers in this scenario due to the fact that we will have already fully hedged the customer's expected commodity usage for the life of the contract. 
 In non-POR markets (and in POR markets where we may choose to direct bill our customers), we manage customer credit risk through formal credit review in the case of commercial customers, and credit score screening, deposits and disconnection for non-payment, in the case of residential customers. Economic conditions may affect our customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in bad debt expense. Our bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 3.0 , 0.2 and 1.6 of non-POR market retail revenues, respectively. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Drivers of Our Business Customer Credit Risk for an analysis of our bad debt expense related to non-POR markets during 2022. 
 We are exposed to wholesale counterparty credit risk in our retail and asset optimization activities. We manage this risk at a counterparty level and secure our exposure with collateral or guarantees when needed. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 1.9 million and 6.6 million of our total exposure of 2.8 million and 7.2 million, respectively, was either with a non-investment grade counterparty or otherwise not secured with collateral or a guarantee. The credit worthiness of the remaining exposure with other customers was evaluated with no material allowance recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates under our Senior Credit Facility and our Series A Preferred Stock. 
 At December 31, 2022, we were co-borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility, under which 100.0 million of variable rate indebtedness was outstanding. Based on the average amount of our variable rate indebtedness outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2022, a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional annual interest expense of approximately 1.0 million. 
 On and after April 15, 2022, our Series A Preferred Stock accrue dividends at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) Three-Month LIBOR (if it then exists), or an alternative reference rate as of the applicable determination date and (b) 6.578 , based on the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid 7.6 million of dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and as of December 31, 2022, based on the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding on December 31, 2022, a 1.0 increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional dividends of 0.9 million for the year.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 It is the responsibility of the management of Via Renewables, Inc. to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of the assets; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, utilizing the criteria in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based upon this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 because of a material weakness in the design and operation of the controls over our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax expense. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness 
 
 We are committed to remediating the control deficiency that gave rise to the material weakness described above. Management is responsible for implementing changes and improvements to internal control over financial reporting and for remediating the control deficiency that gave rise to the material weakness. 
 
 With oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we intend to take the necessary steps to remediate the material weakness by enhancing our internal controls to ensure proper review by and communication between our internal and external tax advisors and internal accounting personnel. Our efforts will consist primarily of strengthening our tax organization through continuing education and refining controls related to components of our tax process to enhance our management review controls over taxes. As part of the key remediation actions, we will: 
 
 Review our tax accounting processes and controls and enhance the overall design and procedures performed to ensure changes in the Company s interest in HoldCo are appropriately identified and recorded; 
 
 Re-design our management review controls and enhance the precision of review of attributes of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, income tax expense; and 
 
 Evaluate the sufficiency of our tax resources and personnel to determine whether additional resources, including tax advisors, are needed. 
 
 68 

Table of Contents 

The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which expresses an adverse opinion and is included herein.

 Basis for opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter

 Derivative Instruments 
 
 As described in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recognized 3.3 million in gross derivative assets and 47.3 million in gross derivative liabilities. We identified the completeness and accuracy of derivatives as a critical audit matter.

 Our audit procedures related to testing the completeness and accuracy of derivative instruments included the following, among others. 
 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process for capturing and accounting for derivative instruments. 
 We independently confirmed a sample of derivative contracts directly with counterparties. 
 We performed reconciliations between the broker s statements and the Company s derivative portfolio records. 
 We tested a sample of derivative contracts to verify underlying data agreed to the Company s records.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ).

million and million, respectively, of which million and million were recorded in current assets, and million and million were recorded in non-current assets. Amortization of customer acquisition costs was million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Customer acquisition costs do not include customer acquisitions through merger and acquisition activities, which are recorded as customer relationships. 
 
 Recoverability of customer acquisition costs is evaluated based on a comparison of the carrying amount of such costs to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the customers acquired, considering specific assumptions for customer attrition, per unit gross profit, and operating costs. These assumptions are based on forecasts and historical experience. 
 
 million and million, net of amortization, as current assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and million and million, net of amortization, as non-current assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to these intangible assets. These intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average life of the related customer contracts acquired, which ranges from two to . 
 
 The acquired customer relationships intangibles related to Provider Companies, Major Energy Companies, Perigee Energy LLC, Verde Companies, and HIKO are reflective of the acquired companies customer base, and were valued at the respective dates of acquisition using an excess earnings method under the income approach. Using this method, the Company estimated the future cash flows resulting from the existing customer relationships, considering attrition as well as charges for contributory assets, such as net working capital, fixed assets, and assembled workforce.

 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On March 20, 2023, the Company s shareholders approved at a special meeting a proposal by the Company s Board of Directors to consummate a reverse stock split of the Company s Class A common stock at a ratio between 1 for 2 to 1 for 5 and (ii) Class B common stock at a ratio between 1 for 2 to 1 for 5, with such ratios to be determined by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer, or to determine not to proceed with the reverse stock split, during a period of time not to exceed the one-year anniversary of the special meeting date (the Reverse Stock Split ). 
 
 On March 20, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect the Reverse Stock Split at a ratio of 1 to 5 for each issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of March 21, 2023 at 5:30 PM ET. The Class A common stock began trading on a post-split basis on March 22, 2023. 
 
 No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and it does not impact the par value of the Class A common stock or Class B common stock. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the next whole number. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock will remain unchanged at shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock. 
 
 All shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split effective March 21, 2023. 
 
 Conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock 
 
 In July 2021, holders of Class B common stock exchanged of their Spark HoldCo units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock at an exchange ratio of share of Class A common stock for each Spark HoldCo unit (and corresponding share of Class B common stock) exchanged. 
 
 Dividends on Class A Common Stock 
 
 Dividends declared for the Company's Class A common stock are reported as a reduction of retained earnings, or a reduction of additional paid in capital to the extent retained earnings are exhausted. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid dividends on our Class A common stock of million, million, and million. This dividend represented an annual rate of per share on each share of Class A common stock. 
 
 On January 18, 2023, the Company declared a dividend of per share to holders of record of our Class A common stock on March 1, 2023 and payable on March 15, 2023. 
 
 In order to pay our stated dividends to holders of our Class A common stock, our subsidiary, Spark HoldCo is required to make corresponding distributions to holders of its units, including those holders that own our Class B common stock (our non-controlling interest holder). As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2022, Spark HoldCo made corresponding distributions of million to our non-controlling interest holders. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On August 18, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of Class A common stock through August 18, 2021. We funded the program through available cash balances, our Senior Credit Facility and operating cash flows. 
 
 The shares of Class A common stock could be repurchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions based on ongoing assessments of capital needs, the market price of the stock, and other factors, including general market conditions. The repurchase program did not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, could be modified or suspended at any time, and could be terminated prior to completion. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased shares of our Class A common stock at a weighted average price of per share, for a total cost of million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not repurchase our Class A common stock. The share repurchase program was suspended in March 2021 pursuant to an agreement with lenders under our Senior Credit Facility. The share repurchase program expired on August 18, 2021. Our Senior Credit Facility does not include a provision for borrowings specific to Class A common stock repurchases. See Note 9 "Debt" for further discussion. 
 
 Preferred Stock

 Issuance of Class A Common Stock Upon Vesting of Restricted Stock Units

Differences between shares vested and issued were a result of , , and shares of common stock withheld by the Company to cover taxes owed on the vesting of such units. 
 
 Earnings Per Share 
 
 Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of Class A common shares outstanding for the period (the denominator). Class B common shares are not included in the calculation of basic earnings per share because they are not participating securities and have no economic interests. Diluted earnings per share is similarly calculated except that the denominator is increased by potentially dilutive securities.

 The computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 excludes million shares of Class B common stock and million restricted stock units because the effect of their conversion was antidilutive. The Company's outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they contain only contingent redemption provisions that have not occurred. 
 
 Variable Interest Entity 
 
 Spark HoldCo is a variable interest entity due to its lack of rights to participate in significant financial and operating decisions and its inability to dissolve or otherwise remove its management. Spark HoldCo owns all of the outstanding membership interests in each of our operating subsidiaries. We are the sole managing member of Spark HoldCo, manage Spark HoldCo's operating subsidiaries through this managing membership interest, and are considered the primary beneficiary of Spark HoldCo. The assets of Spark HoldCo cannot be used to settle our obligations except through distributions to us, and the liabilities of Spark HoldCo cannot be settled by us except through contributions to Spark HoldCo.

 Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to 1.00. The Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) the sum of, among other things, consolidated interest expense, letter of credit fees, non-utilization fees, earn-out payments, certain restricted payments, taxes, and payments made on or after July 31, 2020 related to the settlement of civil and regulatory matters if not included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

 Liability Classified Restricted Stock Units

The fair value of the liability classified restricted stock units is based on the Company s Class A common stock price as of the reported period ending date. The Company recognized stock based compensation expense of million, million and million for years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020, respectively, in general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase to liabilities.

 Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income primarily due to state income taxes and the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income, most notably the income attributable to non-controlling interest, which gets taxed at the non-controlling interest partner level. In addition, in 2021 the Company recognized an effective tax rate benefit from the carry-back of a net operating loss due to higher statutory rate in the carry-back years.

 We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, current industry trends, and our outlook for future years. We believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be utilized, and accordingly have not recorded a valuation allowance on these assets. 
 
 The tax years 2017 through 2021 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject to income tax.

 We use retail gross margin to assess the performance of our operating segments. We define retail gross margin as gross profit less (i) net asset optimization (expenses) revenues, (ii) net (losses) gains on non-trading derivative instruments, (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments, and (iv) gains (losses) from non-recurring events (including non-recurring market volatility). 
 
 We deduct net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the retail gross margin calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on these derivative instruments. We deduct net gains (losses) from non-recurring events (including non-recurring market volatility) to ensure retail gross margin reflects operating performance that is not distorted by non-recurring events or extreme market volatility. Retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the material weakness identified and as described in Item 8 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in this Annual Report, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Annual Report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as of, and for the periods presented in this Annual Report.

 Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, has provided an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
