 Part I 

Item 1. Business. 
 Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is an intelligent power management company dedicated to improving the quality of life and protecting the environment for people everywhere. We are guided by our commitment to do business right, to operate sustainably and to help our customers manage power today and well into the future. By capitalizing on the global growth trends of electrification and digitalization, we're accelerating the planet's transition to renewable energy, helping to solve the world's most urgent power management challenges, and doing what's best for our stakeholders and all of society. 
 Eaton s businesses are well-positioned to take advantage of secular growth trends related to the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. We are responding to these trends by innovating solutions that transform the electrical power value chain, investing in electrical vehicle markets, increasing our focus on electrification, and employing digital technologies for power management. The Company s innovations are expected to enable the integration of renewables and sustainability solutions, with new types of equipment, services, and software. These strategic focus areas are an important part of our response to climate change. 
 Founded in 1911, 2023 marks Eaton's 100 th anniversary of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We reported revenues of 20.8 billion in 2022 and serve customers in more than 170 countries. 
 Eaton electronically files or furnishes reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy and information statements, as well as any amendments to those reports. As soon as reasonably practicable, these reports are available free of charge through the Company's website at www.eaton.com. These filings are also accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures of Businesses 
 Information regarding the Company's acquisitions and divestitures is presented in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Business Segment Information 
 Information by business segment regarding principal products, principal markets, methods of distribution and net sales is presented in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding Eaton's segments and business is presented below. 
 Electrical Americas and Electrical Global 
 Principal methods of competition in these segments are performance of products and systems, technology, customer service and support, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in these segments and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In normal economic cycles, sales of these segments are historically lower in the first quarter and higher in the third and fourth quarters of a year. In 2022, 24 of these segments' sales were made to seven large customers of electrical products and electrical systems and services. 
 Aerospace 
 Principal methods of competition in this segment are total cost of ownership, product and system performance, quality, design engineering capabilities, and timely delivery. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products and platforms, is considered among the market leaders. In 2022, 22 of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers of aircraft. 
 Vehicle 
 Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, technology, global service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In 2022, 32 of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers of vehicles and related components. 
 eMobility 
 Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, technology, global service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment.

 Hydraulics 
 On August 2, 2021, Eaton completed the sale of the Hydraulics business to Danfoss A/S, a Danish industrial company. Prior to the sale, the Hydraulics business was a reportable operating segment. 
 Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General 
 Raw Materials 
 Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, lead, silver, gold, titanium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, chemicals, and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as coils, sheets, strips, ingots, bars, extrusions, castings, forgings, stampings, powder metal, plastic resins, and pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. However, as global economies recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and reacted to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, some of our businesses were impacted by inflation and supply chain constraints, including limited availability of select materials and delivery delays. During this time, we worked closely with our suppliers to manage and minimize the impact on our supply chain. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products may be manufactured, marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. 
 Environmental Contingencies 
 Our comprehensive sustainability strategy is driven by our mission to improve the quality of life and the environment. We are committed to reducing our footprint, eliminating waste, and making the best use of natural resources. Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, including expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Compliance with future environmental protection laws may require an increase in capital expenditures. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Eaton has approximately 92,000 employees globally. The number of persons employed by our reportable segments and corporate at December 31, 2022 are as follows: 
 (In thousands) 2022 Electrical Americas 
 30 Electrical Global 26 Aerospace 13 Vehicle 12 eMobility 2 Corporate 9 Total number of persons employed 92

 Eaton uses and monitors a variety of metrics to ensure our objectives related to employee attraction, development, and retention are met. Most notably, Eaton tracks the following: 
 Inclusion and Diversity 
 Eaton is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and inclusive at all levels, reflecting the diversity of our customers and communities. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the best employees without regard to race, color, social or economic status, religion, national origin, marital status, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any protected status. It is the policy of the Company to make all decisions regarding employment, including hiring, compensation, training, promotions, transfers, or lay-offs, based on the principle of equal employment opportunity and without discrimination. 
 At December 31, 2022, Eaton s distribution by gender, and United States distribution by minority status, is as follows: 
 
 Total Global Number of women (Global) Percentage of women (Global) U.S. total Number of minorities (U.S. only) 1 
 Percentage of minorities (U.S. only) 1 
 Board of directors 
 11 4 36.4 9 4 44.4 Global leadership team 25 5 20.0 23 13 56.5 Executives 618 140 22.7 429 85 19.8 Managers 8,202 1,998 24.4 4,270 871 20.4 All other employees 83,079 29,276 35.2 22,702 8,248 36.3 All employees 91,924 31,419 34.2 27,424 9,217 33.6 
 1 Excluding Puerto Rico 
 At Eaton, one of our aspirational goals is to be a model of inclusion and diversity among our peers. Our plan to achieve this goal encompasses a number of actions, including an examination into our programs, practices, processes, and policies to look for opportunities to strengthen our support of underrepresented individuals, groups and businesses across our operations. 
 Compensation 
 A key component of Eaton s attraction and retention strategy is competitive compensation. Eaton regularly benchmarks its compensation practices with industry peers to maintain a top performing workforce. Eaton s 2022 total employee costs was 5.5 billion including salaries, wages, equity-based compensation, pension and other benefits. The total compensation of our median employee on October 1, 2021, as reported in our 2022 Proxy Statement filed on March 18, 2022, and as calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was 56,287. 
 Safety 
 Throughout our operations, our goal is to have no safety incidents and we continue to make progress towards that goal. For example, in 2021 we reduced our Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR) by 7 (0.39) and our Days Away Case Rate (DACR) by 12 (0.15) compared to 2020. Our TRCR of 0.39 approaches our long-term goal of 0.25, which we believe is a world-class safety rate. Our 2022 TRCR will be provided in our annual Sustainability Report to be issued in 2023. 
 Achieving work-life balance 
 Achieving work-life balance is a common concern of today's employees. Flexible work solutions and inclusive programs will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent and make it possible for employees in varied situations to be able to remain at Eaton. Flexible solutions include compressed work weeks, remote working, job sharing, part-time work, flextime, and telework. 
 Engagement 
 Fully engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include enterprise-wide town halls, hosting informal listening meetings and surveying groups of employees on specific subjects. In addition, we have programs focused on career development of employees at all levels and we are committed to a wide range of strategies designed to improve and sustain employee engagement over the long-term. Our most recent engagement survey of all employees was completed in 2021 and showed a favorable response from 83 percent of employees who completed it. This group reported that they were proud to work at Eaton, felt personal accomplishment from their work, and would recommend Eaton as a place to work. In 2022, we performed a limited employee survey which generally showed similar results as 2021. We plan to perform another survey of all employees in 2023.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Among the risks that could materially adversely affect Eaton's businesses, financial condition or results of operations are the following: 
 Operational Risks 
 Impacts related to, and recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 The global outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted economic activity around the world. As a result, we and our employees, suppliers, customers and others were, at times, restricted or prevented from conducting normal business activities, as a result of shutdowns, travel restrictions and other actions that were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These impacts were partially mitigated for us, given that a substantial portion of our businesses and facilities were classified as essential in jurisdictions in which facility closures were mandated, and most of these disruptions have subsided. None the less, we can give no assurance that there will not be additional closures in the future or that our businesses and facilities will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, should future outbreaks and/or additional strains of the virus impact global economic activity. Further, the pandemic has, and could further disrupt our supply chain. The duration of and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The impact of COVID-19 may also continue to exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations. 
 If Eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality impaired. 
 Eaton relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. Additionally, many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data or connects to external and internal systems. Because of this, cybersecurity threats pose a material risk to our business operations. 
 Global cybersecurity threats range from widespread vulnerabilities, sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, or uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT/OT systems. These threats may be directed at Eaton, its products, software embedded in Eaton s products, or its third-party service providers. The risk is amplified by the increasingly connected nature of our products and systems. These threats may originate from anywhere in the connected world and take the form of phishing, malware, bots, or human-centric attacks. Eaton continually seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats. 
 As a result of our worldwide operations, we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection/privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prefers that we manage personal data in the E.U. and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations. 
 Eaton s customers, including Governmental Agencies, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards which may result in additional operating or production costs. Our cybersecurity program aligns with well-known industry-wide security control frameworks. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include theft of intellectual property, disruption of operations, reputational damage, adverse health and safety consequences, the loss or misuse of confidential information, product failure, as well as exposure to fines, legal claims or enforcement actions. 
 The effects of climate change, including weather disruptions and regulatory/market reactions, create uncertainties that could negatively impact our business. 
 Global increases in greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and there is a growing consensus that dramatic emissions reductions are needed to avoid severe climate impacts. Extreme weather events linked to climate change, including hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and high heat/water scarcity, create physical risks to Eaton s operating locations and supply chains. While Eaton is working to make its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, a global failure to achieve commitments could cause increases in these extreme weather events, political instability, and workforce migration, ultimately increasing Eaton s cost of doing business.

Table of contents 

 Regulatory reactions to climate change may pose more stringent obligations on Eaton s operations and change customer demands. While Eaton is already gearing its portfolio towards products that will reduce carbon and combat climate change, there is a risk that Eaton may not innovate quickly enough to meet changing regulatory or market demands. Increasing demands for metals as the world electrifies may lead to scarcity and increased costs, as may uncertainty over carbon taxes and grid stability during a renewables transition. Despite these uncertainties, we believe Eaton is well positioned to capitalize on secular trends and market opportunities arising from these risks. 
 Eaton's operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted production. 
 Eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company's manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, economic upheaval, or public health concerns such as the spread of COVID-19. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses. 
 Eaton uses a variety of raw materials, components and services in its businesses, and significant inflation could increase operating costs that may not be fully recouped in product pricing. 
 Eaton's major requirements for raw materials are described above in Item 1 Raw Materials . Global shortages have continued to affect the prices Eaton's businesses are charged for raw materials, particularly commodities. Further, Eaton has been impacted by logistics and wage inflation. If this trend continues and we are unable to fully recoup these price increases in product pricing, the competitive position of our products and services may be impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on operating results. 
 Further, some of Eaton's suppliers of component parts have increased their prices in response to increased costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts. Should this trend continue or become more prevalent, the Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs, adversely affecting operating results. 
 Significant shortages of raw materials, energy, components, and/or labor, or similar challenges for our customers could continue to adversely impact our results of operations. 
 Eaton has been impacted by supply chain disruptions. Further, labor shortages persist broadly in select markets. Some of our suppliers have experienced the same conditions and in response, have continued to increase their prices in response to increases in their costs of raw materials, energy and/or labor. While we strive to recoup these increased costs through our pricing, if we are unable to do so without compromising the competitive position of our products and services, our results could continue to be impacted by this trend. Further, should these trends continue or worsen, the impact could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. 
 Industry and Market Risks 
 Volatility of end markets that Eaton serves. 
 Eaton's segment revenues, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that Eaton serves. The Company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates. Future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues, operating results, and profitability. 
 Eaton's operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that Eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services or maintain its present market positions. 
 The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by Eaton's customers. The Company's businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. Eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent Eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. The Company's market positions may also be impacted by new entrants into Eaton's product or regional markets.

Table of contents 

 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Eaton's global operations subject it to economic risk as Eaton's results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation, regulations and policies, or currency fluctuations. 
 Operating globally subjects Eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, data privacy, and exchange controls. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect Eaton's operating results. While the Company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities, these risks could adversely affect operating results. 
 Further, existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, could have an impact on our business and financial results. 
 Eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates, changes in global tax laws and regulations, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. 
 Eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be affected materially by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax legislation, regulations, and policies. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which Eaton operates. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include material unfavorable adjustments to the Company's tax liabilities. 
 Eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which could affect the Company's ability to compete. 
 Protecting Eaton's intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed. The Company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide, as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary, and contribute significantly, to the preservation of Eaton's competitive position in various markets. Although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Eaton or its business segments, there can be no assurance that any one, or more, of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the Company's employees, and into non-disclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers, so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies. 
 Eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact Eaton's businesses. 
 At any given time, Eaton may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in Note 10 and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 Eaton's principal executive offices are located at Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2. The Company maintains manufacturing facilities at approximately 216 locations in 36 countries. The Company is a lessee under a number of operating leases for certain real properties and equipment, none of which is material to its operations. Management believes that the existing manufacturing facilities are adequate for its operations and that the facilities are maintained in good condition. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 Information regarding the Company's current legal proceedings is presented in Note 10 and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends 
 Irish income tax may arise with respect to dividends paid on Eaton shares. Eaton may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax IDWT , currently at a rate of 25 from dividends paid to shareholders who are not tax residents of Ireland even though they are not subject to this tax. To claim exemption from IDWT, shareholders can complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax exemption forms or hold their shares in an account through the Depository Trust Company and have on file with their broker or qualifying agent a valid U.S. address on the record date of the dividend. 
 Eaton shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability for Irish income tax on the dividends unless they are otherwise subject to Irish income tax.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eaton Corporation plc 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eaton Corporation plc the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

 Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits Description of the Matter 
 As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had gross unrecognized income tax benefits of million related to its uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022. Unrecognized income tax benefits are recorded under the two-step recognition and measurement principles when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard, or if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard, but the financial statement tax benefit is reduced as part of the measurement step. 
 
 The balance of unrecognized income tax benefits is comprised of uncertain tax positions which meet the more likely than not standard, but the financial statement tax benefit has been reduced as part of measuring the tax position. 
 
 Auditing management s analysis of its uncertain tax positions and resulting unrecognized income tax benefits is complex as each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated and ultimate resolution is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law, and other factors. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management s controls related to uncertain tax positions. For example, we tested controls over management s application of the two-step recognition and measurement principles and management s review of the inputs and resultant calculations of unrecognized income tax benefits, as well as the identification of uncertain tax positions. 
 
 We also evaluated the Company s assessment of its uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management s accounting policies and documentation to assess the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used to develop its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized income tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we compared the unrecognized income tax benefits recorded with similar positions in prior periods and assessed management s consideration of current tax controversy and litigation, including current year developments with respect to the Company's ongoing litigation and examinations with respect to certain open tax years in the United States. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates of its unrecognized income tax benefits with the resolution of those positions. In addition, we involved tax subject matter professionals to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws, regulations, case law, and Company-specific controversy developments in the Company s recognition determination. We have also evaluated the Company s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters.

 Valuation of Customer Relationships and Technology Intangible Assets in the Acquisition of Mission Systems Description of the Matter 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Mission Systems for a total purchase price of billion, net of cash received. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration paid in the acquisition must be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed generally based on their fair value with the excess of the purchase price over those fair values allocated to goodwill. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of intangible assets made as of the acquisition date were revised during the measurement period in 2022 as third-party valuations were received and finalized resulting in the recognition of customer relationships and technology intangible assets of million and million, respectively. 
 
 Auditing the Company s accounting for its acquisition of Mission Systems was complex because the customer relationships and technology intangible assets recognized were material to the consolidated financial statements and the estimates of fair value involved subjectivity. The subjectivity was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used discounted cash flow models to measure the intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., revenue growth rates and future EBITDA margins). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The fair value of technology intangible assets is also based on the selection of royalty rates used in the valuation model. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over its accounting for the acquisition of Mission Systems, including recognition and measurement of the intangible assets acquired. For example, we tested controls over the recognition and measurement of customer relationships and technology intangible assets, including management s review of the methods and significant assumptions used to develop the fair value estimates. 
 
 To test the estimated fair values of the customer relationships and technology intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. For example, when evaluating the assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and future EBITDA margins, we compared the assumptions to the past performance of Mission Systems and expected industry trends and considered whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the customer relationships and technology intangible assets that would result from changes in the significant assumptions. We involved our EY valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and certain significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eaton Corporation plc 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Eaton Corporation plc s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 to ownership interest. Equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value. An impairment would exist if there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. Investments in associate companies included in Other assets were million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and income from these investments is reported in Other expense (income) - net. Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities. 
 LIBOR Transition 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced it intends to phase out LIBOR. The final publication of rates for certain USD LIBOR tenors is expected to be on June 30, 2023. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify alternative rates to replace LIBOR. The Company s new revolving credit facilities discussed in Note 8 do not reference LIBOR and all interest rate swaps that referenced LIBOR have been settled. Based on the Company's evaluation, the impacts of the transition from LIBOR to alternative rates in its contracts will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 reporting units. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis.

 Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

 Acquisition of Tripp Lite 
 On March 17, 2021, Eaton acquired Tripp Lite for billion, net of cash received. Tripp Lite is a leading supplier of power quality products and connectivity solutions including single-phase uninterruptible power supply systems, rack power distribution units, surge protectors, and enclosures for data centers, industrial, medical, and communications markets in the Americas. Tripp Lite is reported within the Electrical Americas business segment. 
 The acquisition of Tripp Lite has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. During the measurement period which ended in March 2022, opening balance sheet adjustments were made to finalize Eaton's fair value estimates based on the final valuations received, which are summarized in the table below. 
 Accounts receivable ) Inventory ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets ) Property, plant and equipment ) Other intangible assets ) Other assets Accounts payable ) ) Other current liabilities ) ) ) Other noncurrent liabilities ) ) ) Total identifiable net assets ) Goodwill Total consideration, net of cash received 
 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the anticipated synergies of acquiring Tripp Lite. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The estimated fair values of the customer relationships, trademarks and technology intangible assets of million, million, and million, respectively, were determined using either the relief-from-royalty model or the multi-period excess earnings model, which are discounted cash flow models that rely on the Company's estimates. These estimates require judgment of future revenue growth rates, future margins, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The estimated useful lives for customer relationships, trademarks and technology intangible assets were years, years, and years, respectively. See Note 6 for additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets.

The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by discounting contingent payments expected to be made, and may increase or decrease based on changes in revenue estimates and discount rates, with a maximum possible undiscounted value of million. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent future payments has been reduced to million based primarily on anticipated reductions in projected 2023 revenue compared to the initial estimates at closing. This reduction is presented in Other expense (income) - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Acquisition of a stake in HuanYu High Tech 
 On March 29, 2021, Eaton acquired a percent stake in HuanYu High Tech, a subsidiary of HuanYu Group that manufactures and markets low-voltage circuit breakers and contactors in China, and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. HuanYu High Tech has production operations in Wenzhou, China. Eaton accounts for this investment on the equity method of accounting and is reported within the Electrical Global business segment. 
 Acquisition of Mission Systems 
 On June 1, 2021, Eaton acquired Mission Systems for billion, net of cash received. Mission Systems is a leading manufacturer of air-to-air refueling systems, environmental systems, and actuation primarily for defense markets. Mission Systems is reported within the Aerospace business segment. 
 The acquisition of Mission Systems has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. During the measurement period which ended in June 2022, opening balance sheet adjustments were made to finalize Eaton's fair value estimates based on the final valuations received, which are summarized in the table below. 
 Inventory ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property, plant and equipment Other intangible assets ) Other assets ) Accounts payable ) ) Other current liabilities ) ) ) Other noncurrent liabilities ) ) ) Total identifiable net assets ) Goodwill Total consideration, net of cash received 
 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the anticipated synergies of acquiring Mission Systems. As a result of the acquisition, goodwill of million recognized in the United States is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The estimated fair values of the customer relationships, technology, and backlog intangible assets of million, million, and million, respectively, were determined using either the relief-from-royalty model or the multi-period excess earnings model, which are discounted cash flow models that rely on the Company's estimates. These estimates require judgment of future revenue growth rates, future margins, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The estimated fair value of technology intangibles is also based on the selection of royalty rates used in the valuation model. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The estimated useful lives for customer relationships, technology, and backlog intangible assets were years, years, and years, respectively. See Note 6 for additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets.

 of Eaton s Consolidated Net Sales. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions. 
 Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. 
 Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Eaton does not evaluate whether the selling price includes a financing interest component for contracts that are less than a year. Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue are excluded from sales. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of products sold. 
 Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Accrued rebates of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are generally paid annually and were included in Other current liabilities. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Sales commissions are expensed when the amortization period is less than a year and are generally not capitalized as they are typically earned at the completion of the contract when the customer is invoiced or when the customer pays Eaton. 
 Sales of products and services varies by segment and are discussed in Note 17. 
 In the Electrical Americas segment, sales contracts are primarily for electrical components, industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, single phase power quality and connectivity, three phase power quality, wiring devices, circuit protection, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, and services that are primarily produced and sold in North and South America. The majority of the sales in this segment contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer s facility. However, certain power distribution and power quality services are recognized over time. 
 In the Electrical Global segment, sales contracts are primarily for electrical components, industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, single phase and three phase power quality, and services that are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America, as well as hazardous duty electrical equipment, emergency lighting, fire detection, intrinsically safe explosion-proof instrumentation, and structural support systems that are produced and sold globally. The majority of the sales contracts in this segment contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer s facility. However, certain power distribution and power quality services are recognized over time. 
 In the Aerospace segment, sales contracts are primarily for aerospace fuel, hydraulics, and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use, as well as filtration systems for industrial applications. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer s purchase order, and frequently covered by terms and conditions included in a long-term agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer s facility. Our military contracts are primarily fixed-price contracts that are not subject to performance-based payments or progress payments from the customer.

 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (revenue recognized exceeds amount billed to the customer), and deferred revenue (advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized). Accounts receivables from customers were million and million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables were million and million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in unbilled receivables reflects higher revenue recognized from increased business activity in 2022.

 A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog of unsatisfied or partially satisfied obligations, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at December 31, 2022 was approximately billion.

 Retirement Benefits Plans Assumptions 
 In 2022, for purposes of determining liabilities related to the majority of its plans in the United States, the Company used the Pri-2012 mortality tables as well as mortality tables that are based on the Company's own experience and generational improvement scales that are based on MP-2021. In 2020 and 2021, the Company used mortality tables that are based on the Company's own experience and generational improvement scales that are based on MP-2020 and MP-2021, respectively. 
 To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows.

 Pension Plan Assets 
 Investment policies and strategies are developed on a country and plan specific basis. The United States plan, representing of worldwide pension assets, and the United Kingdom plans representing of worldwide pension assets, are invested primarily in debt securities largely for liability hedging, as the majority of the assets are in plans that are well-funded. In general, the plans are primarily allocated to diversified high-quality publicly traded debt, primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled funds in the form of common collective and other trusts. The United States plan's target allocation is United States equities, non-United States equities, public real estate (primarily equity of real estate investment trusts), debt securities and other, including private equity, private debt and cash equivalents. The United Kingdom plans' target asset allocations are equities and the remainder in debt securities, cash equivalents and real estate investments. The equity risk for the plans is managed through broad diversification across industries, geographies, and levels of market capitalization. The majority of debt allocations for these plans are longer duration government and corporate debt. The United States, United Kingdom and Canada pension plans are authorized to use derivatives, including the use of futures, swaps and options, to achieve more economically desired market exposures. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 Financial instruments included in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets are categorized into a fair value hierarchy of three levels, based on the degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation methodology are as follows: 
 Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets. 
 Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
 Level 3 - Unobservable prices or inputs. 
 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables to permit a reconciliation to total plan assets.

 Valuation Methodologies 
 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Common collective and other trusts - Valued at the net unit value of units held by the trust at year end. The unit value is determined by the total value of fund assets divided by the total number of units of the fund owned. The equity investments in collective trusts are predominantly in index funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. The investments in other trusts are predominantly in exchange traded funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. Common collective and other trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets. 
 Fixed income securities - These securities consist of publicly traded United States and non-United States fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and government bonds and debentures). The fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through third-party pricing models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, credit ratings, and current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources. 
 Equity securities - These securities consist of comingled funds and direct investments consisting of the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. 
 United States treasuries - Valued at the closing price of each security. 
 Bank loans - These securities consist of senior secured term loans of publicly traded and privately held United States and non-United States floating rate obligations (principally corporations of non-investment grade rating). The fair value is determined through third-party pricing models that primarily utilize dealer quoted current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources.

 sites worldwide, including the Superfund sites mentioned above, with of these sites being individually significant to the Company. 
 Remediation activities, generally involving soil and/or groundwater contamination, include pre-cleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, design and action planning, performance (where actions may range from monitoring, to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems), and operation and maintenance of a remediation system. The extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site. A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved at a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, and the continuing advancement of remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Eaton has estimated the costs of remediation, which will be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the estimates of these costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an totaling million and million, respectively, for these costs. 
 Based upon Eaton's analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs, the Company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Warranty Accruals 
 Product warranty accruals are established at the time the related sale is recognized through a charge to Cost of products sold. Warranty accrual estimates are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience and specific customer contracts. Provisions for warranty accruals are comprised of basic warranties for products sold, as well as accruals for product recalls and other events when they are known and estimable.

 provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately billion at December 31, 2022, since it is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to deploy capital to those markets which offer particularly attractive growth opportunities. The cash that is permanently reinvested is typically used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.

 Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets 
 Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine its income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards. 
 Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, carryback capability under the tax law in the particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company's goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance. 
 Applying the above methodology, valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax carryforward period.

 Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in facts and circumstances. The Company does not enter into any of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Listed Transactions as set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4. 
 If all unrecognized income tax benefits were recognized, the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be million. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Eaton had accrued approximately million and million, respectively, for the payment of worldwide interest and penalties, which are not included in the table of unrecognized income tax benefits above. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. 
 The resolution of the majority of Eaton's unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law. Therefore, for the majority of Eaton s unrecognized income tax benefits, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the next 12 months. For each of the unrecognized income tax benefits where it is possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the balance within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate any significant change. 
 The Company believes that the final resolution of all the assessments discussed below will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty given the complex nature of tax controversies. Should the ultimate outcome of any one of these matters deviate from our reasonable expectations, final resolution may have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. However, Eaton believes that its interpretations of tax laws and application of tax laws to its facts are correct, and that its accrual of unrecognized income tax benefits is appropriate with respect to these matters. 
 Eaton or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in Ireland and many countries around the world. With only a few exceptions, Eaton and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2014.

 Brazilian tax cases primarily relating to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. One case involves tax years 2005-2008 (Case 1), and the other involves tax years 2009-2012 (Case 2). Case 2 is proceeding on a more accelerated timeline than Case 1. For Case 2, the Company received a tax assessment in 2014 that included interest and penalties. In November 2019, the Company received an unfavorable result at the final tax administrative appeals level, resulting in an alleged tax deficiency of million plus million of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2022 exchange rate). The Company is challenging this assessment in the judicial system and, on April 18, 2022, received an unfavorable decision at the first judicial level. On April 27, 2022, the Company filed a motion for clarification relating to that decision. On May 20, 2022, the court largely upheld its prior decision without further clarification. On June 9, 2022, the Company filed its notice of appeal to the second level court. The Company intends to continue its challenge of this assessment in the judicial system. 
 As previously disclosed for Case 1, the Company received a separate tax assessment alleging a tax deficiency of million plus million of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2022 exchange rate), which the Company is challenging in the judicial system. This case is still pending resolution at the first judicial level. 
 Both cases are expected to take several years to resolve through the Brazilian judicial system and require provision of certain assets as security for the alleged deficiencies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company pledged Brazilian real estate assets with net book value of million and provided additional security in the form of bank secured bonds and insurance bonds totaling million and a cash deposit of million (translated at the December 31, 2022 exchange rate). 
 United States Tax Disputes 
 The IRS typically audits large corporate taxpayers on a continuous basis, generally resulting in many open tax years if there are disputed tax positions upon completion of the audits. The IRS has completed its examination of the consolidated income tax returns of the Company s United States subsidiaries (Eaton US) for 2005 through 2016 and the statuses of the various tax years are discussed below. The IRS has challenged certain tax positions of Eaton US, and the Company is attempting to resolve those issues in litigation and the IRS administrative process, as described in more detail below. The IRS is currently examining tax years 2017 through 2019, and the statute of limitations for those years is open until December 31, 2024. Tax years 2020 and later are subject to future examination by the IRS. Income tax returns of states and localities within the United States will be reopened to the extent of United States federal income tax adjustments, if any, going back to 2005 when those audit years are finalized. The Eaton US tax positions challenged by the IRS are items that recur beyond the tax years for which the IRS has proposed adjustments. Eaton believes that its interpretations of tax laws and application of tax laws to its facts are correct. However, if there is a final unfavorable resolution of any of the issues discussed below, it may have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 In 2011, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for Eaton US for the 2005 and 2006 tax years (the 2005-06 Notice), which Eaton US contested in United States Tax Court. The 2005-06 Notice proposed assessments of million in additional taxes plus million in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the United States. Eaton US has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that Eaton US sells such products to third parties as required by successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) Eaton US entered into with the IRS that governed the 2005-2010 tax years. Eaton US has continued to apply the APA pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. Immediately prior to the 2005-06 Notice being issued, the IRS sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs. The case in Tax Court involved whether the IRS improperly cancelled the APAs. On July 26, 2017, the Tax Court issued a ruling in which it agreed with Eaton US that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs for the tax years 2005-2006. The Tax Court s ruling on the APAs did not have a material impact on Eaton s consolidated financial statements. On May 24, 2021, the IRS filed a notice to appeal the Tax Court s ruling to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 25, 2022, the Sixth Circuit issued a ruling in favor of Eaton US, confirming that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs. The Sixth Circuit s ruling did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and resolves U.S. tax years 2005-2006.

 million in additional taxes plus million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertain to: (i) the same transfer pricing issues and APA for which the Tax Court and Sixth Circuit have issued favorable rulings to Eaton as noted above; and (ii) the separate proposed assessment noted below. The Company believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling discussed above for tax years 2005-2006 should also resolve the APA cancellation issue for the 2007-2010 years. Eaton and the IRS have recognized that the ruling on the enforceability of the APA did not address a secondary issue regarding the transfer pricing for a certain royalty paid from 2006-2010. Eaton US reported a consistent royalty rate for 2006-2010. The IRS has agreed to the royalty rate as reported by Eaton US in 2006. Although the IRS has not proposed an alternative rate, it has not agreed to apply the same royalty rate in the 2007-2010 years. 
 The 2007-10 Notice also includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that the proposed assessment is without merit and contested the matter in Tax Court. In October 2017, Eaton and the IRS both moved for partial summary judgment on this issue. On February 25, 2019, the Tax Court granted the IRS s motion for partial summary judgment and denied Eaton s. The Company intends to appeal the Tax Court s partial summary judgment decision to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The total potential impact of the Tax Court's partial summary judgment decision on the controlled foreign corporation income recognition issue is not estimable until all matters in the open tax years have been resolved. 
 U.S. Tax Years 2011-2013 
 In 2018, the IRS completed its examination of Eaton US for tax years 2011 through 2013 and proposed adjustments. Those adjustments were the subject of administrative appeals, which recently concluded without resolution. As a result, on December 21, 2022, the IRS issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency for Eaton US for these tax years (the 2011-2013 Notice) proposing assessments of million in additional taxes plus million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertain to: (i) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2005-06 and 2007-10 Notices for products manufactured in the Company s facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; (ii) adjustments involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US s controlled foreign corporations; (iii) transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in one of the Company s facilities in Mexico and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; and (iv) adjustments challenging the appropriate interest rate on intercompany debt and amount of intercompany fees charged for financial guarantees on external debt. The Company will file its petition to the U.S. Tax Court on or before March 6, 2023, and will vigorously defend its positions through litigation, which will take several years for final resolution. 
 U.S. Tax Years 2014-2016 
 In 2021, the IRS completed its examination of Eaton US for tax years 2014 through 2016 and has proposed adjustments, including: (i) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2005-06, 2007-10, and 2011-2013 Notices for products manufactured in the Company s facilities in Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; (ii) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2011-2013 Notice for products manufactured in one of the Company s facilities in Mexico and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; and (iii) adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2011-2013 Notice challenging the appropriate interest rate on intercompany debt and amount of intercompany fees charged for financial guarantees on external debt. On November 29, 2021, the case was formally assigned to administrative appeals, and the Company will attempt to resolve certain of the issues in this administrative forum. However, if acceptable resolutions are not achieved, the Company will vigorously defend its positions through litigation, which if undertaken will likely take several years for final resolution. The statute of limitations on these tax years currently remains open until December 31, 2024.

Awards earned at the end of the vesting period range from to of the targeted number of PSUs granted based on the ranking of total shareholder return of the Company, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to a defined peer group of companies. Equity-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Upon vesting, dividends that have accumulated during the vesting period are paid on earned awards. 
 The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing these PSUs include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent 3-year period as of the grant date) and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon bonds with a three-year maturity as of the grant date).

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Eaton enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk of certain long-term debt. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges of certain long-term debt. The maturity of the swap corresponds with the maturity of the debt instrument as noted in the table of long-term debt in Note 8. Eaton also enters into forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on future anticipated debt issuances.

 The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany receivables, payables and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts. The cash flows resulting from the settlement of these derivatives have been classified in investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

 Summary of Results of Operations 
 A summary of Eaton s Net sales, Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, and Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted is as follows: 
 (In millions except for per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 20,752 19,628 17,858 Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders 2,462 2,144 1,410 Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted 6.14 5.34 3.49 
 2020: Organic sales during 2020 were down 11 primarily due to the initial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the divestitures of the Lighting and Automotive Fluid Conveyance businesses also reduced sales, but were partially offset by growth from the acquisitions of Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies and Power Distribution, Inc. 
 2021: Organic sales increased 10 in 2021 as end-markets and regions served by our business segments experienced broad recovery from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Electrical Global, Vehicle and eMobility business segments all realized organic growth greater than 10 during the year, despite supply chain constraints limiting the availability of materials in select businesses, travel restrictions continuing to impact commercial aviation, and reduced production levels at our customers leading to historic low vehicle inventory. 
 2022: Organic sales increased 13 in 2022 due to broad-based strength in end-markets and pricing actions in response to inflationary pressures. Each of our business segments realized organic growth greater than 10 during the year, despite being impacted by operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints or shortages, inflation, and selective labor shortages. 
 Additionally, over the past several years, Eaton has completed a number of transactions to add higher growth, better margin businesses to its portfolio. These portfolio updates have the Company better aligned with secular growth trends and well positioned for expected further growth. These changes to our portfolio of businesses along with double digit organic sales growth and operational performance over the past two years have led to 76 growth in our net income per share since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Consolidated Financial Results table below. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they provide additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our business performance and trends, and they allow investors to more easily compare Eaton s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton. 
 
 Acquisition and Divestiture Charges 
 Eaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs to acquire and integrate businesses, and transaction, separation and other costs to divest and exit businesses. Eaton also recognizes gains and losses on the sale of businesses. A summary of these Corporate items is as follows: 
 (In millions except for per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Acquisition integration, divestiture charges and transactions costs 194 349 288 Gain on the sale of the Hydraulics and Lighting businesses (24) (617) (221) Total charges (income) before income taxes 170 (268) 67 Income tax expense (benefit) (23) 362 66 Total after income taxes 147 94 133 Per ordinary share - diluted 0.37 0.23 0.33

 Acquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs in 2022 are primarily related to the acquisitions of Royal Power Solutions, Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies, Green Motion, Tripp Lite, and Mission Systems, and other charges to acquire and exit businesses including certain indemnity claims associated with the sale of 50 interest in the commercial vehicle automated transmission business in 2017. These costs also included charges of 29 million presented in Other expense (income) - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the decision in the second quarter to exit the Company's business operations in Russia. These charges consisted primarily of write-downs of accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, and accruals for severance. Charges in 2021 are primarily related to the divestiture of the Hydraulics business, the acquisitions of Tripp Lite, Mission Systems, Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies, and Ulusoy Elektrik Imalat Taahhut ve Ticaret A.S., and other charges to acquire and exit businesses including certain indemnity claims associated with the sale of 50 interest in the commercial vehicle automated transmission business in 2017. Charges in 2020 are primarily related to the divestitures of the Hydraulics business and the Lighting business, the acquisitions of Souriau-Sunbank, Ulusoy Elektrik, and Power Distribution, Inc., and other charges to exit businesses. These charges were included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, Research and development expense, or Other expense (income) - net. In Business Segment Information in Note 17, the charges were included in Other expense - net. 
 Restructuring 
 In the second quarter of 2020, Eaton decided to undertake a multi-year restructuring program to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in its business segments and at corporate in order to respond to declining market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the inception of the program, the Company has incurred charges of 325 million. These restructuring activities are expected to be completed in 2023 with total estimated charges of 350 million cumulatively for the entire program and projected mature year savings of 250 million when fully implemented. The remaining charges in 2023 are expected to relate primarily to plant closing and other costs. Additional information related to this restructuring is presented in Note 16.

 Net Sales 
 Changes in Net sales are summarized as follows: 2022 
 2021 
 Organic growth 13 10 Acquisitions of businesses 
 3 5 Divestiture of business (7) (6) Foreign currency (3) 1 Total increase in Net sales 6 10 
 2022: Organic sales increased 13 in 2022 due to broad-based strength in end-markets of the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in sales to commercial OEM and aftermarket in the Aerospace business segment, and higher sales volumes including inflationary recovery in the Vehicle business segment. Despite strong growth, many of our businesses were impacted by operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints or shortages, inflation, and selective labor shortages. 
 The acquisitions of Tripp Lite, Mission Systems, and Royal Power Solutions increased sales in 2022, while the divestiture of the Hydraulics business reduced sales. 
 2021: The increase in organic sales in 2021 was due to broad-based strength in end-markets and regions as our business segments had largely recovered from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. T his organic growth was achieved despite the supply chain constraints experienced by the Electrical Americas business segment, and customers of the Vehicle and eMobility business segments also experienced supply chain constraints leading to reduced production levels. Additionally, organic sales in the Aerospace business segment continued to be impacted by travel restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial aviation.

 Gross Profit 
 2022: Gross profit margin increased from 32.3 in 2021 to 33.2 in 2022 primarily due to higher organic sales, including inflationary pricing recovery. Gross profit also improved due to the net impact of the acquisition of Royal Power Solutions and the divestiture of the Hydraulics business. Conversely, commodity and logistics inflation and operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints had an unfavorable impact on gross margin during 2022, despite offsetting pricing actions. 
 2021: Gross profit margin increased from 30.5 in 2020 to 32.3 in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes and savings from restructuring actions. Organic sales volumes improved in the Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, and Vehicle business segments, and declined in the Aerospace business segment. Gross profit also improved due to the net impact of the acquisitions of Tripp Lite and Cobham Mission Systems and the divestiture of the Hydraulics business. Conversely, commodity and logistics inflation had an unfavorable impact on gross margin during 2021. 
 Income Taxes 
 During 2022, income tax expense of 445 million was recognized (an effective tax rate of 15.3 compared to income tax expense of 750 million in 2021 (an effective tax rate of 25.9 and income tax expense of 331 million in 2020 (an effective tax rate of 19.0 ). Excluding the one-time tax expense associated with the sale of the Hydraulics business in 2021 and the sale of the Lighting business in 2020, both discussed in Note 2, the effective tax rate was between 15.0 and 17.0 for 2022, 2021, and 2020. 2022 2021 2020 Effective tax rate 15.3 25.9 19.0 Tax impact on sale of businesses 9.1 3.9 15.3 16.8 15.1 
 Additionally, see Note 11 for income tax rate reconciliations from Ireland's national statutory rate to the consolidated effective rate. 
 Net Income 
 2022: Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of 2,462 million in 2022 increased 15 compared to 2,144 million in 2021. Net income in 2021 included an after-tax gain of 197 million on the sale of the Hydraulics business. Excluding this gain, the increase in 2022 net income was primarily due to higher gross profit, lower acquisition and divestiture charges, and a net improvement in other income which included gains from the sale of certain office and distribution facilities, partially offset by higher income tax expense and intangible asset amortization expense. 
 Net income per ordinary share increased to 6.14 in 2022 compared to 5.34 in 2021. Net income per ordinary share in 2021 included 0.49 from the sale of the Hydraulics business. Excluding this gain, the increase in Net income per ordinary share in 2022 was due to higher Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and the impact of the Company's share repurchases over the past two years. 
 2021: Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of 2,144 million in 2021 increased 52 compared to 1,410 million in 2020. Net income in 2021 and 2020 included after-tax gains of 197 million on the sale of the Hydraulics business and 91 million on the sale of the Lighting business, respectively. Excluding these gains, the increase in 2021 net income was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower restructuring program charges, partially offset by higher income tax expense, acquisition and divestiture charges, and intangible asset amortization expense. 
 Net income per ordinary share increased to 5.34 in 2021 compared to 3.49 in 2020. Net income per ordinary share in 2021 and 2020 included 0.49 and 0.22 from the sale of the Hydraulics and Lighting businesses, respectively. Excluding these gains, the increase in Net income per ordinary share in 2021 was due to higher Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and the impact of the Company's share repurchases over the past two years.

 2021 
 Organic growth 16 5 Acquisition of Tripp Lite 
 1 7 Divestiture of the Lighting business (4) Total increase in Net sales 17 8 
 The increase in organic sales in 2022 reflects broad-based strength in end-markets, with particular strength in residential, industrial, and data center end-markets. The increase in organic sales in 2021 was primarily due to broad-based recovery in end-markets as they had largely recovered from the initial CO VID-19 pandemic impact with particular strength in residential and data centers, partially offset by weakness in sales to utilities. 
 The operating margin increased from 20.6 in 2021 to 22.5 in 2022 primarily due to higher sales volumes including inflationary pricing recovery, while headwinds from commodity and logistics inflation and operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints were offset by gains from the sale of certain office and distribution facilities. The operating margin increased from 20.2 in 2020 to 20.6 in 2021 primarily due to higher organic sales volumes, the favorable net impact of an acquisition and a divestiture, and savings from restructuring actions. Conversely, commodity and logistics inflation had an unfavorable impact on the operating margin. 
 Electrical Global

 2021 
 Organic growth 11 (2) Acquisition of Mission Systems 
 8 20 Foreign currency (4) 1 Total increase in Net sales 15 19 
 The increase in organic sales in 2022 was primarily due to strength in sales to commercial OEM and aftermarket. The decrease in organic sales in 2021 was primarily due to the impact of continued travel restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial aviation and weakness in military aftermarket. 
 The operating margin increased from 21.9 in 2021 to 23.2 in 2022 primarily due to higher organic sales volumes. The operating margin increased from 18.6 in 2020 to 21.9 in 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Mission Systems and savings from restructuring actions, partially offset by lower organic sales volumes. 
 Vehicle 
 (In millions) 2022 Change from 2021 2021 Change from 2020 2020 Net sales 2,830 10 2,579 22 2,118 Operating profit 453 1 449 85 243 Operating margin 16.0 17.4 11.5 Changes in Net sales are summarized as follows: 2022 
 2021 
 Organic growth 12 21 Foreign currency (2) 1 Total increase in Net sales 10 22 
 The increase in organic sales in 2022 was primarily due to strength in the North American truck and light vehicle markets, and South American truck, bus and agriculture markets. The increase in organic sales in 2021 was primarily due to strength in all regions compared to 2020 which was significantly impacted by plant shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This organic growth was achieved despite the Vehicle business segment's organic sales being negatively impacted in 2021 as a result of its customers experiencing supply chain constraints leading to reduced production levels and historic low vehicle inventory. 
 The operating margin decreased from 17.4 in 2021 to 16.0 in 2022 primarily due to commodity and logistics inflation and operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher sales volumes including inflationary recovery. The operating margin increased from 11.5 in 2020 to 17.4 in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes and savings from restructuring actions, partially offset by commodity and logistics inflation.

 46 Foreign currency (2) 1 Total increase in Net sales 57 17 
 The increase in organic sales in 2022 was due to strength in all regions primarily due to robust demand for electric vehicles. The increase in organic sales in 2021 was primarily due to strength in North American and Asia Pacific regions compared to 2020 which was significantly impacted by plant shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The operating margin increased from negative 8.5 in 2021 to negative 1.6 in 2022 primarily due to higher organic sales volumes and the acquisition of Royal Power Solutions. The operating margin decreased from negative 2.7 in 2020 to negative 8.5 in 2021 primarily due to increased research and development costs and manufacturing start-up costs associated with new electric vehicle programs, and commodity and logistics inflation, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 
 Corporate Expense

 Total corporate expense was 1,286 million in 2022 compared to 810 million in 2021. The increase in Total corporate expense was primarily due to higher Other expense - net and Intangible asset amortization expense, partially offset by lower Restructuring program charges. The increase in Other expense - net is primarily due to the 2021 gain on sale of the Hydraulics business discussed in Note 2, partially offset by lower acquisition and divestiture charges. Total corporate expense was 810 million in 2021 compared to 1,191 million in 2020. The decrease in Total corporate expense was primarily due to lower Other expense - net, lower Restructuring program charges, and the favorable impact of the freeze on the Company's United States pension plans, partially offset by higher Intangible asset amortization expense due to acquisitions of businesses. The decrease in Other expense - net is primarily due to the 2021 gain on sale of the Hydraulics business exceeding the 2020 gain on the sale of the Lighting business by 396 million. This decrease was partially offset by higher acquisition and divestiture charges and higher other corporate expenses due to the removal of the temporary cost containment actions taken during 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Liquidity and Financial Condition 
 Eaton s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. 
 On August 23, 2022, Eaton Corporation issued sustainability-linked senior notes (2022 Sustainability-Linked Notes) and senior notes (2022 Senior Notes, and collectively referred to as the 2022 Notes). The 2022 Sustainability-Linked Notes have a face amount of 1.3 billion, mature in 2033, and pay interest semi-annually at an initial interest rate of 4.15 per annum. Beginning in September 2028, the interest rate payable on the 2022 Sustainability-Linked Notes will be increased by an additional 25 basis points per annum if the Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions sustainability performance target is not met. The 2022 Senior Notes have a face amount of 700 million, mature in 2052, and pay interest semi-annually at 4.70 per annum. The issuer received proceeds totaling 1.98 billion from the issuance of the 2022 Notes, net of financing costs and discounts. 
 On October 3, 2022, the Company replaced its existing 2,000 million five-year revolving credit facility with a new 2,500 million five-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 1, 2027. On the same date, the Company replaced its existing 500 million 364-day revolving credit facility with a new 500 million 364-day revolving credit facility that will expire on October 2, 2023. The revolving credit facilities totaling 3,000 million are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. In October 2022, the Company also upsized its commercial paper program to 3,000 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under Eaton s revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2022. The Company had access to the commercial paper markets through its 3,000 million commercial paper program, of which 300 million was outstanding on December 31, 2022, used primarily to manage fluctuations in working capital. In addition to the revolving credit facilities, the Company also had available lines of credit of 919 million from various banks primarily for the issuance of letters of credit, of which there was 414 million outstanding at December 31, 2022. 
 In 2021, Eaton received proceeds of 3.1 billion from the sale of its Hydraulics business and paid 4.45 billion to acquire Tripp Lite and Mission Systems. In 2022, the Company paid 610 million to acquire Royal Power Solutions and received cash of 22 million from Danfoss A/S to fully settle all post-closing adjustments from the sale of the Hydraulics business. 
 Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Eaton had cash of 294 million and 297 million, short-term investments of 261 million and 271 million, and short-term debt of 324 million and 13 million, respectively. Eaton has investment grade credit ratings from the two major rating agencies as reflected in the following ratings assigned to its debt: 
 Credit Rating Agency (long- /short-term rating) Rating Outlook Standard Poor's A-/A-2 Stable outlook Moody's Baa1/P-2 Stable outlook 
 Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, availability under existing revolving credit facilities, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt. 
 For additional information on financing transactions and debt, see Note 8. 
 Eaton s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton s present credit rating level, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as defined in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not exceed 10 . Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton is in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.

 Cash Flows 
 A summary of cash flows is as follows: 
 (In millions) 2022 Change from 2021 2021 Change from 2020 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,533 370 2,163 (781) 2,944 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,200) 564 (1,764) (2,161) 397 Net cash used in financing activities (1,340) (805) (535) 2,723 (3,258) Effect of currency on cash 4 9 (5) 10 (15) Total increase (decrease) in cash (3) (141) 68 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 370 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily due to taxes paid on the sale of the Hydraulics business in 2021, cash received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2022, lower pension contributions in 2022 due to a 200 million contribution to Eaton's U.S. qualified pension plan in 2021, and higher net income in 2022, partially offset by higher working capital balances to support the Company s organic growth. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 781 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to higher working capital balances to support the Company s organic growth as our business segments had largely recovered from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, taxes paid on the sale of the Hydraulics business, and a 200 million pension contribution to Eaton's U.S. qualified pension plan in 2021. 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 564 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in the use of cash was primarily driven by the decrease in cash paid in 2022 for business acquisitions to 610 million in 2022 compared to 4,500 million in 2021, proceeds from the sale of certain office and distribution facilities in 2022, and the decrease in cash paid for investments in associate companies to 42 million in 2022 from 124 million in 2021, partially offset by proceeds received in 2021 from the sale of Hydraulics business of 3,129 million and net purchases of short-term investments of 19 million in 2022 compared to net sales of 379 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were 598 million in 2022 compared to 575 million in 2021. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 2,161 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in the use of cash was primarily driven by cash paid in 2021 for business acquisitions of 4,500 million compared to cash paid in 2020 for business acquisitions of 200 million, partially offset by proceeds received in 2021 from the sale of Hydraulics business of 3,129 million compared to proceeds received in 2020 from the sale of the Lighting business of 1,408 million, and net sales of short-term investments of 379 million in 2021 compared to net purchases of 441 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were 575 million in 2021 compared to 389 million in 2020. 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 805 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in the use of cash was primarily due to higher payments on borrowings of 2,012 million in 2022 compared to 1,013 million in 2021, higher share repurchases of 286 million in 2022 compared to 122 million in 2021, and higher dividends paid of 1,299 million in 2022 compared to 1,219 million in 2021, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds of short-term debt 317 million in 2022 from 20 million in 2021 and higher proceeds from borrowings of 1,995 million in 2022 compared to 1,798 million in 2021. 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 2,723 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease in the use of cash was primarily due to higher proceeds from borrowings of 1,798 million in 2021 compared to no proceeds from borrowings in 2020, lower share repurchases of 122 million in 2021 compared to 1,608 million in 2020, and net proceeds of short-term debt of 20 million in 2021 compared to net payments of 254 million in 2020, partially offset by higher payments on borrowings of 1,013 million in 2021 compared to 249 million in 2020.

 Uses of Cash 
 Purchases of Goods and Services 
 The Company purchases goods and services in the normal course of business based on expected usage. For certain purchases, the Company enters into purchase obligations with various vendors, which include short-term and long-term commitments for purchases of raw materials, outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders, releases under blanket purchase orders, and commitments under ongoing service arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has purchase obligations to support the operation of its business similar to those included in historical cash flow trends. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures were 598 million, 575 million, and 389 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Eaton expects approximately 630 million in capital expenditures in 2023. 
 Dividends 
 Cash dividend payments were 1,299 million, 1,219 million, and 1,175 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On February 23, 2023, Eaton's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.86 per ordinary share, a 6 increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2022. The dividend is payable on March 24, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 6, 2023. Payment of quarterly dividends in the future depends upon the Company s ability to generate net income and operating cash flows, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by the Eaton Board of Directors. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. 
 Share Repurchases 
 On February 27, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for share repurchases up to 5.0 billion of ordinary shares (2019 Program). On February 23, 2022, the Board renewed the 2019 Program by providing authority for up to 5.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). Under the 2022 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During 2022, 2.0 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2022 Program in the open market as a total cost of 286 million. During 2021, 0.9 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2019 Program in the open market at a total cost of 122 million. At December 31, 2022, there is 4,714 million still available for share repurchases under the 2022 Program. The Company will continue to pursue share repurchases in 2023 depending on market conditions and capital levels. 
 Acquisition of Businesses 
 The Company paid cash of 610 million, 4,500 million, and 200 million to acquire businesses in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company will continue to focus on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for higher growth and strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies. 
 Debt 
 The Company manages a number of short-term and long-term debt instruments, including commercial paper. For additional information on financing transactions and debt, see Note 8. 
 Leases 
 See Note 7 for maturities of lease liabilities. 
 Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits 
 At December 31, 2022, the gross unrecognized income tax benefits totaled 1,235 million and interest and penalties were 137 million. Eaton cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. For additional information about income taxes see Note 11.

 Defined Benefits Plans 
 Pension Plans 
 During 2022, the fair value of plan assets in the Company s employee pension plans decreased 1,798 million to 4,121 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in plan assets was primarily due to lower than expected return on plan assets and the impact of negative currency translation. At December 31, 2022, the net unfunded position of 499 million in pension liabilities consisted of 573 million in plans that have no funding requirements and 125 million in plans that require funding, offset by 199 million in plans that are overfunded. 
 Funding requirements are a major consideration in making contributions to Eaton s pension plans. With respect to the Company s pension plans worldwide, the Company intends to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations. In 2022, 116 million was contributed to the pension plans. The Company anticipates making 108 million of contributions to certain pension plans during 2023. The funded status of the Company s pension plans at the end of 2023, and future contributions, will depend primarily on the actual return on assets during the year and the discount rate used to calculate certain benefits at the end of the year. For additional information about pension plans see Note 9. 
 Supply Chain Finance Program 
 The Company negotiates payment terms directly with its suppliers for the purchase of goods and services. In addition, a third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company s suppliers, at the supplier s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. If a supplier elects to participate in the SCF program, the supplier decides which invoices are sold to the financial institution and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier s decision to sell an invoice. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The amounts due to the financial institution for suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Accounts payable included 208 million and 151 million, respectively, payable to suppliers that have elected to participate in the SCF program. 
 Guaranteed Debt 
 Issuers, Guarantors and Guarantor Structure 
 Eaton Corporation has issued senior notes pursuant to indentures dated April 1, 1994 (the 1994 Indenture), November 20, 2012 (the 2012 Indenture), September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture) and August 23, 2022 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date, the 2022 Indenture). The senior notes of Eaton Corporation are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Registered Senior Notes). Eaton Capital Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Eaton, is the issuer of four outstanding series of debt securities sold in offshore transactions under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the Eurobonds). The Eurobonds and the Registered Senior Notes (together, the Senior Notes) comprise substantially all of Eaton s long-term indebtedness. 
 Substantially all of the Senior Notes, together with the credit facilities described above under Liquidity and Financial Condition (the Credit Facilities), are guaranteed by Eaton and 17 of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, they rank equally with each other. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Eaton and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, Eaton has no material, long-term secured debt. The guaranteed Registered Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Eaton's subsidiaries that are not guarantors. Except as described below under Future Guarantors, Eaton is not obligated to cause its subsidiaries to guarantee the Registered Senior Notes. 
 The table set forth in Exhibit 22 filed with this Form 10-K details the primary obligors and guarantors with respect to the guaranteed Registered Senior Notes.

Table of Contents 

 Terms of Guarantees of Registered Securities 
 Payment of principal and interest on the Registered Senior Notes is guaranteed, on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by the subsidiaries of Eaton set forth in the table referenced in Exhibit 22. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and joint and several. Each guarantor's guarantee is an unsecured obligation that ranks equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes is subject to a customary savings clause or similar provision designed to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise legally impermissible or voidable obligation. 
 Though the terms of the indentures vary slightly, generally, each guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes by a guarantor that is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation provides that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: 
 (a) the consummation of certain types of transactions permitted under the applicable indenture, including one that results in such guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and 
 (b) for Registered Senior Notes issued under the 2022 Indenture, when such guarantor is a guarantor or issuer of indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of less than 25 of our total outstanding indebtedness. 
 Further, each guarantee by a direct or indirect parent of Eaton Corporation (other than Eaton) provides that it will also be released if: 
 (c) such guarantee (so long as the guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligations), becomes prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any contractual obligation; or 
 (d) such guarantee results in material adverse tax consequences to Eaton or any of its subsidiaries (so long as the applicable guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligation). 
 The guarantee of Eaton does not contain any release provisions. 
 Future Guarantors 
 The 2012 and 2017 Indentures generally provide that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under any series of debt securities or a syndicated credit facility. Further, the 2012 and 2017 Indentures provide that any entity that becomes a direct or indirect parent entity of Eaton Corporation and holds any material assets, with certain limited exceptions, or owes any material liabilities must become a guarantor. The 2022 Indenture provides only that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of 25 of the Parent and its Subsidiaries' then-outstanding indebtedness. 
 The 1994 Indenture does not contain provisions with respect to future guarantors. 
 Summarized Financial Information of Guarantors and Issuers (In millions) December 31, 2022 Current assets 3,363 Noncurrent assets 12,938 Current liabilities 2,948 Noncurrent liabilities 10,047 Amounts due to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net 16,285 (In millions) 2022 Net sales 11,433 Sales to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors 911 Cost of products sold 9,277 Expense from subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net 747 Net loss (26)

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Sales are recognized when control of promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. The majority of the Company s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions. 
 Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. 
 Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 for additional information.

 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and is based on the net assets for each reporting unit, including goodwill and intangible assets. The Company s reporting units are equivalent to the reportable operating segments, except for the Aerospace segment which has two reporting units. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis. 
 Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price. 
 The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a qualitative analysis in 2022 and 2021, except for the eMobility reporting unit which used a quantitative analysis. A qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative analysis performed for each reporting unit. The results of the qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform quantitative analysis. 
 Quantitative analyses were performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The future cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the reporting unit's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 
 Based on these analyses performed in 2022 and 2021, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts and thus, no impairment exists. 
 Indefinite Life Intangible Assets 
 Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2022 and 2021 was performed using a quantitative analysis. Determining the fair value of these assets requires significant judgment and the Company uses a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 
 Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events that could affect inputs used to determine the respective fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 For 2022 and 2021, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value. 
 For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see Note 6.

 Acquisitions of Businesses 
 The acquisition of a business is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires assets and liabilities to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date. The initial fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be revised based on the final determination of fair value during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date. The Company generally determines the fair value of intangible assets acquired using third-party valuations that are prepared using discounted cash flow models that rely on the Company's estimates. These estimates require judgement of future revenue growth rates, future margins, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. For additional information about the acquisitions of businesses see Note 2. 
 Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets 
 Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards. 
 Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, carryback capability under the tax law in a particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company s goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance. For additional information about income taxes see Note 11. 
 Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits 
 Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in law, facts and circumstances. Eaton also estimates, where reasonably possible, the increase or decrease in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
 The evaluation and determination of the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions is complex and involves both the exercise of judgement and the utilization of certain estimates and assumptions. Each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated in light of current tax laws, regulations, and judicial decisions. Additionally, the ultimate resolution of the majority of Eaton s unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans 
 The measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates, return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which ultimately affects net income. 
 The discount rate for United States plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that would generate the same benefit obligation. Only corporate bonds with a rating of Aa, determined by averaging the ratings by Moody s, Standard Poor's, and Fitch, were included. Callable bonds that are not make-whole bonds and certain other non-comparable bonds were eliminated. Finally, a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50 of the bonds that had the highest yields. 
 94 

Table of Contents 

 The discount rates for non-United States plans were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate and government bonds. Consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate. 
 To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows. 
 Key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each year-end. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a 52 million effect on pension expense. Likewise, a 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a 40 million effect on pension expense. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have less than 1 million effect on other postretirement benefits expense. A 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have a 3 million effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans. 
 Additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in Note 9. 

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE 
 On a regular basis, Eaton monitors third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and short-term investments, primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds. The Company diversifies its cash and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Eaton also monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact. 
 Eaton uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company are straightforward and non-leveraged. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. See Note 15 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments. 
 Eaton s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is based on the strength of its credit rating and overall market conditions. During 2022, the Company has not experienced any material limitations in its ability to access these sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2022, Eaton had 3,000 million of long-term revolving credit facilities with banks in support of its commercial paper program. It has no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities. 
 Interest rate risk can be measured by calculating the short-term earnings impact that would result from adverse changes in interest rates. This exposure results from short-term debt, which includes commercial paper at a floating interest rate, long-term debt that has been swapped to floating rates, and money market investments that have not been swapped to fixed rates. Based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end 2022, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have increased the Company s net, pre-tax interest expense by 2.6 million. 
 Eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the Company s financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates. Based on Eaton s best estimate for a hypothetical, 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2022, the market value of the Company s debt, in aggregate, would decrease by 600 million. 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced it intends to phase out LIBOR. The final publication of rates for certain USD LIBOR tenors is expected to be on June 30, 2023. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify alternative rates to replace LIBOR. The Company s new revolving credit facilities discussed in Note 8 do not reference LIBOR and all interest rate swaps that referenced LIBOR have been settled. Based on the Company's evaluation, the impacts of the transition from LIBOR to alternative rates in its contracts will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to volatility in raw material costs and contractual agreements with suppliers. To partially mitigate this exposure, Eaton enters into commodity contracts for certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. These commodity contracts are designated for hedge accounting and are generally less than one year in duration. Based on Eaton s best estimate for a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices the gain or loss would be 5 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. Any change in the value of the contracts would be offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged transactions. 
 The Company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Eaton also monitors exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which the Company operates, and regularly enters into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure. In the aggregate, Eaton s portfolio of forward contracts related to such transactions was not material to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
