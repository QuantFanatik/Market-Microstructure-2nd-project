By leveraging its low-cost deposit franchise, BancPlus believes it has been able to generate a strong net interest margin compared to its peers without taking undue credit risk. 
 
 Diversified and Growing Loan Portfolio 
 
 BancPlus believes its markets provide opportunities to grow its loan portfolio organically while diversifying credit risk exposure. From December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2022, its loan portfolio grew from 1.9 billion to 5.8 billion, an increase of 204.3 and a compound annual growth rate of 21.5 .

Additionally, BancPlus is focused on ongoing improvement of productivity and operational efficiency to increase shareholder value. 
 
 Employee Ownership and High Customer Satisfaction 
 
 BancPlus believes its employees are critical to its success, and its culture of empowerment stems in part from its employees owning approximately 13 of its common stock as of December 31, 2022. BankPlus has been recognized by American Banker as one of the Best Banks to Work For every year since the ranking s inception in 2013. BancPlus believes the vested interest of its employees, coupled with its relationship-driven approach to meeting the needs of its customers, will continue to drive future growth. BancPlus further believes its empowered employees significantly enhance customer experience, as evidenced by Forbes magazine ranking BankPlus as the top bank in Mississippi in 2018 for its America s Best in State Banks rankings based on overall customer satisfaction. 
 
 Extensive Enterprise and Credit Risk Management Framework 
 
 BancPlus understands the importance of a strong enterprise risk management framework. BancPlus risk management is supported by disciplined credit underwriting and a robust set of policies and procedures. BancPlus has a comprehensive approach to enterprise risk management which focuses on credit, reputational, operational, compliance, liquidity and interest rate risk in order to manage its balance sheet in a manner that will meet its short and long term needs.

 Business Strategy 
 
 Drive Organic Growth Through Execution of Community-Focused Business Model 
 
 BancPlus business strategy is to provide exceptional community banking services and financial solutions within its markets, which enables BancPlus to fulfill its core purpose of enriching lives and building stronger communities. BancPlus believes its commitment to its communities is an integral part of its past success and will continue to keep its bankers in a position to develop business and expand market share. BancPlus experienced professionals, supported by strong brand recognition and a disciplined business development platform, leverage its banking solutions to increase market share and acquire new customers throughout its markets. BancPlus commitment to providing high quality products, service and customer-facing technology strengthens its ability to attract and retain business. 
 
 Pursue Opportunistic, Strategic Acquisitions 
 
 BancPlus believes its footprint and surrounding markets will afford it strategic opportunities to supplement organic growth with acquisitions to strengthen its franchise. In particular, BancPlus may consider acquisition opportunities that could improve its market position, enhance its branch network, increase its earnings power or expand its suite of products and services. Within Mississippi and surrounding states, there are over 200 banking franchises whose asset size fits BancPlus acquisition target profile. BancPlus experienced management team has a proven ability to successfully evaluate potential new markets and execute acquisitions of banks and other financial services entities. Moreover, BancPlus believes its investment in technology creates the scalable infrastructure necessary to both execute these acquisition strategies and ensure long-term success. 
 
 Effective March 1, 2022, we completed our previously announced merger (the FTC Merger with First Trust Corporation FTC ), the holding company of First Bank and Trust FBT ). See Note 2 Business Combinations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the FTC Merger. 
 
 Capitalize on Changing Market Dynamics 
 
 BancPlus believes the investment it makes in its employees, along with the culture and work environment it has created and cultivates, allow BancPlus to attract top talent. BancPlus believes it stands to benefit from the dislocation of both employees and customers as banks continue to consolidate and competitors shift their focus. BancPlus has had success in growing meaningful market share through the hiring of experienced individuals as market dynamics change and will seek to replicate this strategy in the future. 
 
 Expand Non-interest Income Through Complementary Products and Services 
 
 BancPlus believes it has built successful products and services that support its core banking business. These products and services include wealth management, treasury services and mortgage origination. Each of these business lines is managed by an experienced team and has scalable infrastructure to support additional growth of non-interest income with minimal added expense. BancPlus organizational structure promotes teamwork among employees who support its various products and services to enhance customer retention and optimize relationship profitability. BancPlus may also look to grow certain revenue-generating products and services via acquisitions or hiring of teams or individuals. 
 
 Embrace New Technologies to Meet Customer Needs and Drive Efficiencies 
 
 Technology investments are an integral part of BancPlus strategy. BancPlus has implemented a significant number of front and back office technology initiatives, including the successful deployment of its popular mobile and digital banking platforms. BancPlus will continue to invest in technologies it believes will have the most positive impact for driving growth, increasing productivity or creating efficiency. An example is BancPlus growing deployment of ITMs and universal bankers in select markets, making its services more accessible, better utilizing branch personnel and improving the customer experience. Over time, BancPlus expects these and similar initiatives to help it further optimize staff productivity and its branch network. 
 
 BancPlus Services

BancPlus is dedicated to serving the banking needs of its customers, from family farms and small towns to large corporations and metropolitan areas, through its community banking approach of personalized, relationship-based service.

 Lending Activities and Lending Strategy 
 
 BancPlus offers a variety of loans, including commercial and industrial, commercial real estate-backed loans (including loans secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial properties), commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, borrowing base loans, construction and development loans, homebuilder loans, agricultural loans, Small Business Administration SBA loans, letters of credit and other loan products to small and medium-sized businesses, real estate developers, manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. BancPlus also offers various consumer loans to individuals and professionals including residential real estate loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit HELOCs ), installment loans, unsecured and secured personal lines of credit and letters of credit. Lending activities originate from the relationships and efforts of BancPlus bankers, with an emphasis on providing banking solutions tailored to meet its customers needs while maintaining its underwriting standards. 
 
 BancPlus strategy is to grow its loan portfolio by originating commercial and consumer loans that produce revenues consistent with its financial objectives. Through its operating model and strategies, BancPlus seeks to be the leading provider of lending products and services in its market areas to its clients. BancPlus markets its lending products and services to its clients through its high-touch personalized service. As a general practice, BancPlus originates substantially all of its loans, but BancPlus occasionally participates in syndications, limiting participations to loans originated by lead banks with which BancPlus has a close relationship and which share its credit philosophies. 
 
 BancPlus also actively pursues and maintains a balanced loan portfolio by type, size and location. BancPlus loans are generally secured and supported by personal guarantees. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. BancPlus originates commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, and construction/land/land development loans that are generally secured by real estate located in its market areas. BancPlus commercial mortgage loans are primarily collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized over a 10 to 20 year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. BancPlus multi-family residential loans are primarily secured by multi-family properties, primarily apartment and condominium buildings. BancPlus seeks to make multi-family residential loans to experienced real estate investors with proven track records. 
 
 With respect to BancPlus owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, BancPlus targets local companies with a proven operating history that tend to be business-operators and professionals within its markets. Owner-occupied real estate loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower, and hence are dependent on the success of the underlying business for repayment and are more exposed to general economic conditions. 
 
 With respect to its non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, BancPlus seeks experienced, local real estate developers and investors with whom its bankers have long-standing relationships. BancPlus non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans also tend to involve retail, hotel, office, multi-family, medical, warehouse and industrial properties. Non-owner occupied real estate loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale of the completed property or rental proceeds from such property, and are therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market, which can also be affected by general economic conditions.

Table of Content s 

 Commercial real estate loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Adverse developments affecting commercial real estate values in BancPlus market areas could increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral for these loans, and affect BancPlus ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss. Furthermore, adverse developments affecting the business operations of the borrowers of BancPlus owner-occupied commercial real estate loans could significantly increase the credit risk associated with these loans. Due to the larger average size of commercial real estate loans, BancPlus faces the risk that losses incurred on a small number of commercial real estate loans could have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion. The typical terms for commercial loans are one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan-to-value ratio depends on the type of collateral. 
 
 Residential Real Estate Loans. BancPlus residential real estate loans consist of 1-4 family loans, home equity loans and multi-family loans. The residential real estate loans described below exclude mortgage loans that are held for sale. BancPlus 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, which are both owner-occupied and investor-owned. BancPlus seeks to make its 1-4 family mortgage loans to well-qualified homeowners and investors with a proven track record that satisfy its credit and underwriting standards. BancPlus home equity loans are primarily revolving lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential properties. 
 
 BancPlus expects to continue to make residential real estate mortgage loans at a similar pace as BancPlus has in recent years so long as housing values in its markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and it is able to make such loans consistent with its credit and underwriting standards. Like its commercial real estate loans, BancPlus residential real estate loans are secured by real estate, the value of which may fluctuate significantly over a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. BancPlus primarily makes its residential real estate loans to qualified individuals and investors in accordance with its real estate lending policies, which detail maximum loan to value ratios and maturities and, as result, the repayment of these loans can also be affected by adverse personal circumstances. 
 
 Mortgage Banking . BancPlus is also engaged in the residential mortgage banking business, which primarily generates income from the origination and sale of mortgage loans. BancPlus originates residential mortgage loans as a service to its existing customers and as a way to develop relationships with new customers in order to support its core banking strategy. BancPlus mortgage banking revenue is affected by changes in the fair value of mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell because it measures these loans at fair value under the fair value option. BancPlus looks to originate quality mortgage loans with a focus on purchase money mortgages along with a focus on refinancing primary residences. In accordance with its lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight that satisfies secondary market standards as outlined by its investors and mortgage officers as to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. 
 
 The residential mortgage industry is highly competitive and BancPlus competes with other community banks, regional banks, national banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, financial service companies and online mortgage companies. Due to the highly competitive nature of the residential mortgage industry, BancPlus expects to face industry-wide competitive pressures related to changing market conditions that will impact its pricing margins and mortgage revenues. 
 
 BancPlus mortgage banking business is also directly impacted by the interest rate environment, increased regulation, consumer demand, driven in large part by general economic conditions and the real estate markets, and investor demand for mortgage securities. Mortgage production, especially refinancing activity, tends to decline in rising interest rate environments. While BancPlus had been experiencing historically low interest rates for an extended period of time, market interest rates rose during 2022 and BancPlus believes that interest rates may continue to rise during 2023. 
 
 Consumer Loans . BancPlus offers a variety of consumer loans, such as installment loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans. BancPlus consumer loans typically are part of an overall client relationship designed to support the individual consumer borrowing needs of BancPlus commercial loan and deposit clients, and these consumer loans are well diversified across BancPlus markets. Consumer loans usually have shorter terms, lower balances, higher yields and higher risks of default than residential real estate mortgage loans. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability and are therefore more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances, such as the loss of employment, unexpected medical costs or divorce. These loans are often secured by the underlying personal property, which typically has insufficient value to satisfy the loan without a loss due to damage to the collateral and general depreciation.

Lending Philosophy . BankPlus lending philosophy is driven by its commitment to thorough underwriting for all loans, local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships and a conservative credit culture. To implement this philosophy, BankPlus has established various levels of authority and review, including its Executive Loan Committee comprised of the Chief Credit Officer and other lending executives. In its review, BankPlus emphasizes cash flow and secondary and tertiary repayment sources such as guarantors. 
 
 Lending Policies. BankPlus has established standard documentation and policies based on the type of loan. BankPlus also has established a loan committee comprised of its senior executive lending officers. Credits of 15 million or greater are generally presented for review or approval prior to committing to the loan. The Executive Loan Committee generally meets weekly and on an ad hoc basis as needed. Relationships between 5 million and 15 million must be approved by two voting members of the loan committee and a Credit Officer. Credit Officers approve relationships between 1 million and 5 million. Relationships under 1 million are generally approved by a local market or regional president. 
 
 Loan Approval Process. The loan approval process at BankPlus is characterized by local authority supported by a risk control environment that provides for prompt and thorough underwriting of loans. BankPlus localized decision-making is reinforced through a centralized review process supported by technology that monitors all credits to ensure compliance with its credit policies. BankPlus loan approval method is based on a hierarchy of individual lending authorities for new credits and renewals granted to its individual bankers, market presidents, credit officers, senior management and Executive Loan Committee. The BankPlus board of directors establishes the maximum individual lending limits at each level and its senior management team sets individual authorities within these maximum limits to each individual based on demonstrated experience and expertise, and are periodically reviewed and updated. BankPlus believes that the ability to have individual loan authority up to specified levels based on experience and track record coupled with appropriate approval limits for its market presidents and credit officers allows it to provide prompt and appropriate responses to its clients while still allowing for the appropriate level of oversight. 
 
 As a relationship-oriented lender, rather than transaction-oriented lender, BankPlus makes most of its loans to borrowers located or operating in its market area. This provides BankPlus with better understanding of their business, creditworthiness and the economic conditions in their market and industry. 
 
 In considering loans, BankPlus follows the underwriting principles set forth in its loan policy with a primary focus on the following factors: 
 
 a relationship with its clients that provides BankPlus with a complete understanding of their financial condition and ability to repay the loan; 
 verification that the primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan; 
 observation of appropriate loan to value guidelines for real estate secured loans; 
 targeted levels of diversification for the loan portfolio, both as to type of borrower and type of collateral; and 
 proper documentation of loans, including perfected liens on collateral. 
 
 As part of the approval process for any given loan, BankPlus seeks to minimize risk in a variety of ways, including the following: 
 
 analysis of the borrower s financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and leverage; 
 assessment of the project s operating history, operating projections, location and condition; 
 review of appraisals, title commitment and environmental reports; 
 consideration of management s experience and financial strength of the principals of the borrower; and 
 understanding economic trends and industry conditions. 
 
 The BankPlus board of directors reviews and approves loan policy changes, monitors loan portfolio trends and credit trends, and reviews loan transactions as set forth in its loan policies. Loan pricing is established in conjunction with the loan approval process based on pricing guidelines for loans that are set by BankPlus senior management. BankPlus believes that its loan approval process provides for thorough internal controls, underwriting, and decision-making. 
 
 Lending Limits. BankPlus is limited in the amount it can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of its capital. BankPlus is a Mississippi chartered bank and therefore all branches, regardless of location, fall under the legal lending limits of the state of Mississippi. Mississippi s legal lending limit is a safety and soundness measure intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank s funds. It is also intended to safeguard a bank s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of creditworthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Generally, under Mississippi law, loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 20 of BankPlus aggregate unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Further, with prior approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance MDBCF ), BankPlus may elect to conform to similar standards applicable to national banks under federal law, in lieu of Mississippi law. Because the federal law and 
 10 

Table of Content s 

 Mississippi state law standards are determined as a percentage of BankPlus capital, these state and federal limits either increase or decrease as BankPlus capital increases or decreases. BankPlus may seek to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which would allow BankPlus to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of its clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits. 
 
 In addition to these legally imposed lending limits, BancPlus also employs appropriate limits on its overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending and individual lending relationships. For example, BancPlus has lending limits related to borrower, portfolio segments and certain types of commercial real estate exposures. 
 
 Deposits and Other Sources of Funds 
 
 An important aspect of BancPlus business franchise value is the ability to gather deposits. BancPlus offers its customers a variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts, through multiple channels, including its extensive network of 94 branch locations. As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus held 5.825 billion of total deposits. As of December 31, 2022, 97.1 of its total deposits were core deposits (defined as total deposits excluding time deposits greater than 250,000 and brokered deposits). BancPlus obtains most of its deposits from individuals, small businesses and municipalities in its market areas. BancPlus solicits deposits from these target segments through its local bankers, sophisticated product offerings and its brand-awareness initiatives, such as its community focused marketing and high-visibility branch locations. BancPlus believes that the rates it offers for core deposits are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in its market areas. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and other borrowings. These secondary sources enable BancPlus to borrow funds at rates and terms, which, at times, are more beneficial to BancPlus. 
 
 The growth of low-cost deposits is an important aspect of BancPlus strategic plan, and BancPlus believes it is a significant driver of its value. Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. BancPlus deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in areas surrounding its branches, and BancPlus believes that it has attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in its markets. In order to attract and retain deposits, BancPlus relies on providing quality service, offering a suite of retail and commercial products and services and introducing new products and services that meet its customers needs as they evolve. 
 
 Wealth Management and Investment Services 
 
 BancPlus offers a variety of investment management services to affluent and high net worth individuals and families through the BankPlus Wealth Management Group, which has been serving clients for over 20 years. BancPlus focuses on providing customized investment solutions to best fit its clients risk tolerance and achieve their financial objectives. Additionally, BancPlus provides asset management and financial planning services, including retirement plan services and administration, personal trusts and estates, portfolio management, institutional trusts and court appointed trust services. 
 
 Other Banking Services 
 
 Given customer demand for increased convenience and account access, BancPlus offers a range of products and services, including 24-hour Internet banking and voice response information, 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. banking in certain branch locations, mobile applications, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, and automatic account transfers. BancPlus earns fees for some of these services. BancPlus also receives ATM transaction fees from transactions performed by its customers participating in a shared network of ATMs and a debit card system that its customers can use throughout the United States as well as in other countries. Further, BancPlus offers ITMs, which are discussed in Information Technology Systems below in this section. 
 
 Enterprise Risk Management 
 
 BancPlus operating model demands a strong risk culture built to address multiple areas of risk, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, compliance risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. BancPlus risk culture is supported by significant investments in the right people and technologies to protect its business. The BancPlus board of directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing risk management at both the holding company and BankPlus level. BancPlus seeks to prudently identify and manage its risks through a disciplined, enterprise-wide approach to risk management, particularly credit, compliance and interest rate risk. BancPlus risk management framework is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer who has more than 30 years of banking experience. BancPlus also maintains a risk management committee at BankPlus. BancPlus comprehensive risk management framework is designed to complement its core strategy of empowering its experienced, local bankers with local decision-making to better serve its clients.

 BancPlus endeavors to maintain asset quality through an emphasis on local market knowledge, long-term client relationships, and a conservative credit culture. BancPlus credit policies support its goal of maintaining sound credit quality standards while achieving balance sheet growth, earnings growth, appropriate liquidity and other key objectives. BancPlus loan policies are designed to provide its bankers with a sufficient degree of flexibility to permit them to deliver responsive and effective lending solutions to clients while maintaining appropriate credit quality. Furthermore, BancPlus aims to hire bankers and associates for the long-term by incentivizing them to focus on long-term credit quality. Since lending represents credit risk exposure, the BancPlus board of directors and its duly appointed committees seek to ensure that BankPlus maintains appropriate credit quality standards. BancPlus has established asset oversight committees to administer the loan portfolio, such as the Executive Loan Committee, which meets regularly to review the lending activities of BankPlus. 
 
 Credit Risks. The principal economic risks associated with each category of loans that BancPlus makes are the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. General economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and the demand for the commercial borrower s products and services, as well as other factors affecting a borrower s customers, suppliers and employees, all affect borrower creditworthiness. Risks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates and, in the case of commercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower s management. Consumer loan repayments depend upon the borrower s financial stability and are more likely than commercial loans to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships. 
 
 Information Technology Systems 
 
 BancPlus has recently made and continues to make significant investments in its information technology systems for its banking operations and related services. BancPlus believes that these investments are essential to enhance its capabilities to offer new products and overall customer experience, to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions, and to increase controls and efficiencies in its back-office operations. BancPlus technology investments include investment in the foundational layer of its infrastructure (including security, data and voice network, storage and disaster recovery) with the intent of establishing a technology platform that will allow it to grow with incremental expenditures. BancPlus has obtained its core data processing platform from a nationally recognized bank processing vendor, providing it with capabilities to support the continued growth of BankPlus. BancPlus leverages the capabilities of a third-party service provider to provide the technical expertise around network design and architecture that is required for BancPlus to operate as an effective and efficient organization. BancPlus actively manages its business continuity plan. BancPlus strives to follow all recommendations outlined by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in an effort to determine that BancPlus has effectively identified its risks and documented contingency plans for key functions and systems including providing for back-up sites for all critical applications. BancPlus performs tests of the adequacy of these contingency plans on at least an annual basis. 
 
 BancPlus has invested in ITMs that enable its customers to interact with tellers outside of regular banking hours. The ITMs support cash withdrawals, cash and check deposits, check cashing, loan payments and account transfers. BancPlus believes that expansion of its ITM network may increase the productivity of its branch staff, the consistency of the customer experience and the optimization of its branch network. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The financial services business is highly competitive, and BancPlus profitability will depend upon its ability to compete with other banks and non-bank financial service companies located in its markets for lending opportunities, deposit funds, financial products, bankers and acquisition targets. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of its business from banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and other financial service providers such as money market funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset-based non-bank lenders, insurance companies and certain other non-financial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than BancPlus can. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus conducted business through 94 branches across Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in BancPlus primary market areas. These institutions include many of the largest banks operating in Mississippi, some of which are also among the largest banks in the country. Many of BancPlus competitors serve the same counties as BancPlus does. BancPlus competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that BancPlus may not currently offer, and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than BancPlus does. To offset these competitive disadvantages, BancPlus depends on its reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly.

 BancPlus believes employing a diverse workforce enhances its ability to serve its customers and communities. BancPlus commitment to diversity values individual differences. BancPlus believes that respecting differences among all people is critical to delivering high-performance products and services to its customers and the communities it serves. BancPlus is committed to creating an environment where its employees and customers are treated fairly and where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. BancPlus is committed to cultivating an inclusive work environment, free of discrimination or harassment, and it will continue to promote and support diversity. 
 
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 
 General 
 
 BankPlus is extensively regulated, supervised, and examined under federal and state law. Generally, these laws and regulations are intended to protect BankPlus depositors, the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ), and the broader banking system, and not BancPlus shareholders. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of BancPlus business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of its customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, and transactions with affiliates. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of BancPlus profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. In addition, changes to these laws and regulations, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on BancPlus business, results of operations, and financial condition. As a result, the extensive laws and regulations to which BancPlus is subject and with which BancPlus must comply significantly impact its earnings, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. 
 
 Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of key federal and state laws that affect the regulation of bank holding companies and banks. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Supervision and Examination Authorities 
 
 As a bank holding company, BancPlus is subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve ). BankPlus has a Mississippi state charter and is subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement by the MDBCF. In addition, as a state non-member bank, BankPlus is subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement by the FDIC as BankPlus primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and MDBCF regularly examine the operations of BancPlus and BankPlus and are given the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, consolidations, the establishment of branches, and similar corporate actions. These agencies also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.

 Federal Law Restrictions on the Company s Activities and Investments 
 
 As a registered bank holding company, BancPlus is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act (the BHCA and to the regulation, supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. 
 
 The BHCA and its implementing regulations prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in certain transactions without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, including (i) acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, and (iii) merging or consolidated with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve such a transaction, the Federal Reserve is required to consider a variety of factors, including the competitive impact of the transaction; the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the applicant s record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act; and the effectiveness of the parties in combatting money laundering activities. The Bank Merger Act imposes similar review and approval requirements in connection with acquisitions and mergers involving banks. Additionally, under the Change in Bank Control Act and BHCA, a person or company that acquires control of a bank holding company or bank must obtain the non-objection or approval of the Federal Reserve in advance of the acquisition. For a bank holding company that has a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), such as BancPlus, control for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act is presumed to exist if the acquirer will have 10 or more of any class of the company s voting securities. 
 
 The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in, or acquiring control of a company engaged in, activities other than managing or controlling banks, activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking, and certain other permissible nonbanking activities. However, a bank holding company that is qualified and has elected to be a financial holding company may engage in or acquire control of a company engaged in an expanded set of financial activities. BancPlus has not elected to be a financial holding company. 
 
 A provision of the BHCA known as the Volcker Rule generally prohibits a banking entity (which includes any insured depository institution and its affiliates and subsidiaries) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading and (ii) acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, sponsoring, or engaging in certain transactions with, a covered fund, including private equity and hedge funds. Under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA and implementing regulations of the federal financial agencies, insured depository institutions and their affiliates with no more than 10 billion in total consolidated assets and that have total trading assets and trading liabilities totaling no more than 5 of total consolidated assets, including BancPlus and BankPlus, are exempt from the Volcker Rule. 
 
 Source of Strength 
 
 As a bank holding company, BancPlus is expected to act as a source of financial strength for BankPlus and to commit resources to support BankPlus. This support may be required at times when we might not be inclined to provide it. In addition, in the event of BankPlus insolvency, any capital loans made by BancPlus to BankPlus will be repaid only after BankPlus deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full. 
 
 Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions 
 
 BankPlus is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under federal and state laws, regulations and policies. BancPlus is a legal entity separate and distinct from BankPlus and its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for dividends paid to BancPlus shareholders has been dividends paid to BancPlus by BankPlus. Federal and state law limit BankPlus ability to pay dividends to BancPlus. 
 
 Under Mississippi law, BankPlus must obtain the non-objection of the MDBCF prior to paying any dividend on common stock of BankPlus. 
 
 Further, under federal law, the ability of an insured depository institution such as BankPlus to pay dividends or other distributions is restricted or prohibited if (i) the distribution would cause the institution to become undercapitalized, (ii) the institution is in default of its payment of deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC or (iii) the institution would fail to satisfy the regulatory capital conservation buffer (if applicable to the institution) following the distribution. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to prohibit BankPlus from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of BankPlus, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. 
 
 As a bank holding company, BancPlus payments of dividends to its shareholders are subject to federal law limitations. The Federal Reserve has adopted the policy that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover the cash dividends, and that the company s rate of earning retention is consistent with the company s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In addition, a bank holding company 
 14 

Table of Content s 

 is required to consult with or notify the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming its outstanding equity securities in certain circumstances, including if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company's consolidated net worth. A bank holding company that is well-capitalized, well-managed, and not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues is exempt from this notice requirement. 
 
 BancPlus Corporation issued preferred stock to the United States Treasury under the Emergency Capital Investment program made available to Community Development Financial Institutions (individually, an ECIP recipient ). As an ECIP recipient, capital distributions are subject to restrictions set forth in Appendix A of 31 CFR Part 35, limiting share buybacks and dividends. Prior approval of the U.S. Treasury is required for BancPlus to make capital distributions in excess of its eligible distributable income which is calculated as the ECIP recipient s (a) year-to-date net income as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter, plus net income for the two preceding calendar years, less (b) any dividends or capital distributions for the year-to-date as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter, and for the two preceding calendar years. 
 
 Capital Adequacy 
 
 Bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios imposed under federal capital adequacy regulations. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC, the primary federal regulators of BancPlus and BankPlus, respectively, have adopted substantially similar regulatory capital frameworks. 
 
 EGRRCPA permits most banking organizations with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets to elect to be exempt from the agencies generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital rules and the capital conservation buffer described below if they satisfy a community bank leverage ratio CBLR requirement. In order to qualify for the CBLR exemption, a banking organization may not have off-balance sheet exposures totaling more than 25 of its assets or trading assets and liabilities totaling more than 5 of its assets. A banking organization satisfies the CBLR and is considered well capitalized if it maintains a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., a leverage ratio) of more than 9 . BancPlus and BankPlus elected to use the CBLR framework beginning in the third quarter of 2022. 
 
 Under the general applicable capital adequacy rules that apply to most bank holding companies and banks that have not elected to use the CBLR framework, such institutions must each maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6 , a total capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8 , and leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 4 . Under these generally applicable capital adequacy rules, institutions are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 2.5 of risk-weighted assets in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 
 
 Under the capital rules, common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes certain common stock instruments (plus any related surplus), retained earnings, and certain minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations). Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock (plus any related surplus) and certain minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations). Tier 2 capital generally includes certain subordinated debt (plus related surplus), certain minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain limitations), and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses ALLL ). Common equity tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital are each subject to various regulatory deductions and adjustments. The risk-based capital standards of the generally applicable capital adequacy rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profile by risk weighting assets and off-balance-sheet exposures based on risk categories. 
 
 Failure to meet their applicable capital requirements could subject BancPlus and BankPlus to a variety of enforcement actions, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and certain other restrictions on its business. 
 
 In addition, under the FDIC s prompt corrective action framework, the FDIC may impose various restrictions, including limitations on growth and the payment of dividends, if an insured depository institution such as BankPlus becomes undercapitalized. Because it has elected to use the CBLR framework, BankPlus is considered well capitalized if it maintains a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets of more than 9 . An insured depository institutions that has not elected to use the CBLR framework would be considered to be well capitalized if it has a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 or greater, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5 or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by its primary regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is well-capitalized, or is adequately capitalized and has received a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, BancPlus exceeded the minimum CBLR requirement, maintaining a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets equal to 10.54 . At December 31, 2022, BankPlus exceeded the minimum CBLR requirement, maintaining a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets equal to 9.31 , and was well-capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes based on its CBLR. 
 
 Under a December 2018 final rule, banking organizations may elect to phase in the regulatory capital effects of the current expected credit losses CECL model, the new accounting standard for credit losses, over three years. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act permits financial institutions to defer temporarily the use of CECL. In a related action, the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule effective March 31, 2020, that allows banking organizations that implemented CECL in 2020 to elect to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard on their regulatory capital for two years. This two-year delay is in addition to the three-year transition period that the agencies had already made available in December 2018. BancPlus and BankPlus have elected to defer the regulatory capital effects of CECL in accordance with the interim final rule, and not to apply the deferral of CECL available under the CARES Act. Under the regulations, BancPlus is required to begin the three-year transition in the first fiscal year it has adopted CECL, which for BancPlus is 2023. As a result, the regulatory capital impact of BancPlus adoption of CECL is being phased in from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. 
 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders, Tying Arrangements, and Lending Limits 
 
 BankPlus is subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with BancPlus and its affiliates. Transactions between banks and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by Regulation W, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes applicable to a state non-member bank like BankPlus in the same manner and to the same extent as if it were a member bank. An affiliate of a bank typically is any company or entity that controls or is under common control with the bank, including the bank s parent holding company and non-bank subsidiaries of that holding company. Some but not all subsidiaries of a bank may be exempt from the definition of an affiliate. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of the bank s capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions and certain other transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of a loan to an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate, and several other types of transactions. Extensions of credit to an affiliate usually must be over-collateralized. 
 
 Under section 22 of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation O, which FDIC regulations make applicable to a state non-member bank like BankPlus in the same manner and to the same extent as if it were a member bank, restrictions also apply to extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests, and to similar individuals at the holding company or affiliates. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit to these insiders also require the approval of the bank s board of directors. Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act limits asset sales and purchases between a bank and its insiders. 
 
 Under anti-tying rules of federal law, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any service or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or service from or to the bank or its holding company or their subsidiaries (other than those related to and usually provided in connection with a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service) or (ii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property, or service from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. The federal banking agencies have, however, allowed banks to offer combined-balance products, and otherwise to offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. The law authorizes the Federal Reserve to grant additional exceptions by regulation or order. 
 
 Under Mississippi law, a state bank is generally prohibited from making loans or other extensions of credit to any one borrower in an amount exceeding 20 of the aggregate unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the bank. The limit on loans and 
 16

 extensions of credit applicable to any one counterparty must take into consideration credit exposure arising from derivative transactions between the bank and the counterparty. 
 
 Reserves 
 
 Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, an insured depository institution must maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. Because required reserves generally must be maintained in the form of vault cash, with a pass-through correspondent bank, or in the institution s account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement may be to reduce the amount of an institution s assets available for lending or investment. During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Federal Reserve indicated that it may adjust reserve requirement ratios in the future if conditions warrant. 
 
 FDIC Insurance Assessments 
 
 BankPlus deposits are insured by the DIF to the maximum extent permitted by law. BankPlus is required to pay quarterly premiums, known as assessments, for this deposit insurance coverage. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums as determined by multiplying an insured bank s assessment base by its assessment rate. A bank s deposit insurance assessment base is generally equal to its total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. A bank s regular assessments are determined within a range of base assessment rates based in part on its CAMELS composite rating, taking into account other factors and adjustments. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system developed to classify a bank s overall condition by taking into account capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market and interest rate risk. The methodology that the FDIC uses to calculate assessment amounts is also based on the FDIC s designated reserve ratio, which is currently 2 . Under the current methodology, a bank s assessment rates are based on an initial base assessment rate of 5 to 32 cents per 100 of the assessment base, subject to certain adjustments, and, for a bank of BankPlus size, may range from 2.5 to 32 cents after applying adjustments. 
 
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including BankPlus, if the FDIC determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order, or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. The FDIC also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of BankPlus deposit insurance. 
 
 Branching 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, BankPlus has branch offices in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. Current federal law generally authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation, so long as the acquirer satisfies certain conditions, including that it is well capitalized and well managed. Furthermore, a well capitalized and well managed bank with its main office in one state is generally authorized to merge with a bank with its main office in another state, subject to certain deposit-percentage limitations, aging requirements, and other restrictions. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks may establish de novo branches across state lines, subject to capital, management, and community reinvestment standards, and other restrictions. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 
 The Community Reinvestment Act CRA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income borrowers in their local communities. The agencies periodically examine the CRA performance of each of the institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator, and assign one of four ratings: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial Noncompliance. In order for an insured depository institution and its parent holding company to take advantage of certain regulatory benefits, such as expedited processing of applications and the ability of the holding company to engage in new financial activities, the insured depository institution must maintain a rating of Outstanding or Satisfactory. An institution s size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. The FDIC evaluates BankPlus as a large, retail-oriented institution and applies performance-based lending, investment, and service tests. In its most recent CRA evaluation, as of March 22, 2021, BankPlus was rated Outstanding. 
 
 On May 5, 2022 the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that would substantially revise how they evaluate an insured depository institution s record of satisfying the credit needs of its entire communities, including low- and moderate- income individuals and neighborhoods, under the CRA. If this rule is finalized as proposed, it may become more challenging and/or costly for BankPlus and other insured depository institutions to achieve an Outstanding or Satisfactory CRA rating.

Consumer Protection Laws 
 
 BankPlus is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business, and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale, or provision of consumer financial products and services. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and their state law counterparts. 
 
 Because BankPlus has assets of not more than 10 billion, its primary federal regulator, the FDIC, examines and enforces BankPlus compliance with consumer financial protection laws. However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB has rulemaking authority, including with respect to prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, that affects banks of any size. Additionally, the CFPB may participate in examinations of banks with not more than 10 billion in assets on a sampling basis and may refer potential enforcement actions against such banks to their primary federal regulators. 
 
 Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability, including actual damages, restitution, and injunctive relief, from litigation brought by customers, state attorneys general, and other plaintiffs, as well as enforcement actions by banking regulators and reputational harm. 
 
 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity 
 
 Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also provides that, with certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided, and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 
 
 The federal banking agencies pay close attention to the cybersecurity practices of banks, and the agencies include review of an institution s information technology and its ability to thwart cyberattacks in their examinations. An institution s failure to have adequate cybersecurity safeguards in place can result in supervisory criticism, monetary penalties, and/or reputational harm. 
 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Compliance 
 
 The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and other federal laws and regulations require financial institutions to, among other things, institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering AML program. Under these laws and regulations, BankPlus is required to take steps to prevent the use of BankPlus to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money, to report large currency transactions, and to file suspicious activity reports. In addition, BankPlus is required to develop and implement a comprehensive AML compliance program, as well as have in place appropriate know your customer policies and procedures. 
 
 The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in addition to other bank regulatory agencies, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of these requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with state and federal banking regulators, in addition to the U.S. Department of Justice, the CFPB, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. Violations of AML requirements can also lead to criminal penalties. In addition, the federal banking agencies are required to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s AML activities when reviewing proposed bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. 
 
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC of the U.S. Department of the Treasury is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals, and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and in various pieces of legislation. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring, or engaging in terrorist acts. If BancPlus or BankPlus find a name on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, BancPlus or BankPlus must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report, and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

 BancPlus and BankPlus maintain policies, procedures, and other internal controls designed to comply with these AML requirements and sanctions programs. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 
 BancPlus is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Dallas, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of banking institutions. Each FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system, and makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB and subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from an FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. 
 
 Real Estate Lending Evaluations 
 
 The federal regulators have adopted uniform standards for evaluations of loans secured by real estate or made to finance improvements to real estate. Banks are required to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending policies consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its operations. The regulations establish loan-to-value ratio limitations on real estate loans. BancPlus loan policies establish limits on loan-to-value ratios that are equal to or less than those established in such regulations. 
 
 Commercial Real Estate Concentrations 
 
 Under guidance issued by the federal banking regulators, a financial institution will be considered to have a significant commercial real estate CRE concentration risk, and will be subject to enhanced supervisory expectations to manage that risk, if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land C D represent 100 or more of the institution s total capital, or (ii) total CRE loans represent 300 or more of the institution s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the prior 36 months. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus total C D loans (as defined in the guidance) as a percentage of capital totaled 113.7 and its total CRE loans (as defined in the guidance) as a percentage of capital totaled 339.3 . 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Certain factors may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the value of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. 
 
 Risk Factors Summary 
 
 The most significant risks that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations are summarized below. 
 
 We are subject to conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general. 
 Our business and operations are concentrated in the Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida markets, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the local economy and lower growth rates in that region. 
 The concentration of small to medium-sized businesses to which we lend may be more vulnerable to adverse business developments, which may impair our borrowers ability to repay loans. 
 Our loan portfolio contains a number of large loans to certain borrowers, and a deterioration in the financial condition of any of these borrowers could have a significant adverse impact on our asset quality. 
 Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses. 
 We are subject to the various risks associated with our banking business and operations, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance risks, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if we are unable to manage such risks. 
 19 

Table of Content s 

 We face significant competition to attract and retain customers, which could impair our growth, decrease our profitability or result in loss of market share. 
 New activities and expansion require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them or failure by BankPlus to perform satisfactorily on its CRA evaluations may restrict BancPlus growth. 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the current regulatory framework and any future legislative and regulatory changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements, including stringent capital requirements, consumer protection laws, and anti-money laundering laws, and failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general. 
 
 BancPlus business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. The business environment in which BancPlus operates has been impacted by the effects of worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty. Economic activity continued to improve during 2022 as COVID-19 cases declined across the United States and restrictions were lifted; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and the economic conditions domestically and in foreign countries, including global political hostilities and other financial crises as well as the increasing amount of United States sovereign debt. Inflation has become elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, higher energy prices and broader price pressures. Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term. Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising interest rates and modest economic growth, remains high. Management s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to BancPlus ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital. Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance. 
 
 Market interest rates rose during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows. The prolonged period of reduced interest rates in recent years, has and may continue to place pressure on net interest margins for BancPlus (as well as its competitors). Conversely, as interest rates rise, so do competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds. It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline. If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how BancPlus business would be affected and whether BancPlus would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business. Accordingly, these factors in the global and the United States economies could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. 
 
 BancPlus ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. BancPlus has exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, BancPlus participates in loans originated by other institutions and syndicated transactions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the lead bank. As a result, defaults by, declines in the financial condition of, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, financial service companies or the financial services industry generally, may lead to difficulties related to liquidity, asset quality or other problems and could lead to losses or defaults by BancPlus or by other institutions. These problems, losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The geographic concentration of BancPlus markets in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida makes BancPlus more susceptible to adverse changes in the local economy, lower growth rates in that region, and natural disasters such as tornadoes and flooding and other catastrophic events, including climate change.

Table of Content s 

 Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diverse, BancPlus is primarily a Mississippi banking franchise with locations in Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida. As of December 31, 2022, most of BancPlus total loans (by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who reside or conduct business in the Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida markets, and substantially all of BancPlus real estate loans are secured by properties located in these markets. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the residential or commercial real estate markets could have an adverse effect on the quality of BancPlus portfolio, the demand for its products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. If the population, employment or income growth in any of BancPlus markets is negative or slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely impacted. Some of BancPlus larger competitors that are more geographically diverse may be better able to manage and mitigate risks posed by adverse conditions impacting only local or regional markets. For these reasons, any regional or local economic downturn could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida economies have lately grown at overall rates that are lower than the United States economy as a whole. For its market share to increase substantially, BancPlus must attract customers from its competitors. If BancPlus is unable to do so, it may be unable to execute its business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Further, the markets where a significant portion of BancPlus business is generated from have been, and may continue to be, susceptible to damage by major seasonal flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and other natural disasters and adverse weather, as well as public health crises and other catastrophic events, including the effects of climate change. Natural disasters, public health crises, or other catastrophic events can disrupt BancPlus operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which it operates. Additionally, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health crises and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. If the economies in BancPlus primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of a natural disaster, adverse weather, the effects of climate change, a public health crisis or other catastrophic or adverse external event, demand for loans and BancPlus other products and services could be reduced. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and loan losses may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be adversely affected by a disaster. Natural or man-made disasters, public health crises or other catastrophic events, including the effects of climate change, could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses that could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 The concentration of small to medium-sized businesses to which BancPlus lends may be more vulnerable to adverse business developments, which may impair BancPlus borrowers ability to repay loans. 
 
 BancPlus focuses its business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which BancPlus operates and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected, or BancPlus borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, this, in turn, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus loan portfolio contains a number of large loans to certain borrowers, and a deterioration in the financial condition of any of these borrowers could have a significant adverse impact on its asset quality. 
 
 BancPlus growth over the past several years has been partially attributable to its ability to originate and retain relatively large loans given its asset size. As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus 20 largest borrowing relationships represented 8.39 of its total outstanding loan portfolio, including mortgage loans held for sale, and 11.08 of its total commitments to extend credit. Along with other risks inherent in BancPlus loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, the larger size of these loans presents a risk to its lending operations. If any of its largest borrowers become unable to repay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions or personal circumstances, BancPlus nonperforming loans and its provision for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus faces significant competition to attract and retain customers, which could impair its growth, decrease its profitability or result in loss of market share. 
 21 

Table of Content s 

BancPlus operates in the highly competitive banking industry and in very competitive markets and faces significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors, particularly regional institutions, in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services. BancPlus competitors are generally larger and may have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks or geographic footprints than BancPlus does. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than BancPlus can be on loan and deposit pricing. Also, many of BancPlus non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. BancPlus expects competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the emergence of alternative banking sources. 
 
 BancPlus ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among others: 
 
 its ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; 
 its scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; 
 the rate at which it introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; 
 customer satisfaction with its level of service; 
 its ability to expand its market position; 
 its ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; 
 industry and general economic trends; and 
 its ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology. 
 
 Increased competition could require BancPlus to increase the rates it pays on deposits or lower the rates it offers on loans, which could reduce its profitability. BancPlus failure to compete effectively in its primary markets could cause it to lose market share and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Credit, Liquidity and Capital Risks 
 
 BancPlus is subject to credit risk, and may not be able to adequately measure and limit its credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses. 
 
 As a lender, BancPlus is exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover its outstanding exposure. In addition, BancPlus is exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors, including local market conditions and general economic conditions. Many of BancPlus loans are made to small to medium-sized businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. BancPlus risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of its loans within specific industries and markets and its credit approval, review and administrative practices may not adequately assess and reduce credit risk, and BancPlus credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with BancPlus loan portfolio may result in unexpected losses and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 A lack of liquidity could impair BancPlus ability to fund operations. 
 
 Liquidity is essential to BancPlus business, and BancPlus monitors its liquidity and manages its liquidity risk at the BancPlus and BankPlus levels. BancPlus relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of its loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that it has adequate liquidity to fund its operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of BancPlus investment securities, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on BancPlus liquidity. BancPlus most important source of funds is deposits, and its future growth will largely depend on its ability to retain and grow its deposit base. Deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to certain factors outside of BancPlus control, such as increasing competitive pressures for deposits, including when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, customer perceptions of BancPlus financial health and general reputation, or a loss of confidence by customers in BancPlus or the banking sector generally, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, BancPlus would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing its net interest income and net income. 
 
 22 

Table of Content s 

 Other primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities. BankPlus also has the ability to borrow from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which provides it access to a secondary source of funds. BancPlus may also borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. An additional source of funds is the proceeds from the issuance and sale of BancPlus equity and debt securities to investors. BancPlus access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable to it, could be impaired by factors that affect BancPlus directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. BancPlus access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in its primary market area or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against it. 
 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact BancPlus ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying its borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity and could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, because BancPlus primary asset at the holding company level is BankPlus, BancPlus liquidity at the holding company level depends primarily on its receipt of dividends from BankPlus. If BankPlus is unable to pay dividends to BancPlus for any reason, BancPlus may be unable to satisfy its holding company level obligations, which include funding operating expenses, debt service and dividends. 
 
 Interest rate shifts could reduce net interest income. 
 
 Like most financial institutions, BancPlus earnings depend to a great extent upon the level of its net interest income, or the difference between the interest income it earns on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease BancPlus net interest income depending on the make-up of its assets and liabilities. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater degree than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. As of December 31, 2022, 34.30 of BancPlus interest earning assets and 21.30 of its interest-bearing liabilities were variable rate. These percentages of variable rate balances, as well as the terms of BancPlus fixed rate interest-bearing balances, resulted in a slightly asset sensitive balance sheet as December 31, 2022. Assuming a stable product mix, no change in customer behavior, no change in yield curve and stability of related items, BancPlus net interest income would increase with rising interest rates and decrease with falling interest rates. 
 
 Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans, decrease loan repayment rates, and increase early withdrawals on term deposits. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and also has indicated that it expects to continue to raise rates. In contrast, a decrease in the general level of interest rates could affect BancPlus through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan portfolio, and its cost of funds may not fall as quickly as yields on earning assets. BancPlus asset-liability management strategy may not be effective in mitigating exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 Because a significant portion of BancPlus loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing BancPlus real estate loans and result in loan and other losses. 
 
 Real estate values in BancPlus markets have experienced periods of fluctuation over the last several years, and recovery from declines in value has been slow and uneven and illiquidity of real estate holdings has increased. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. As of December 31, 2022, 4.9 billion, or 84.6 , of BancPlus total loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary component of collateral. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of BancPlus markets could increase the credit risk associated with its loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in BancPlus market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect its ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Further, if real estate values decline, it is also more likely that BancPlus would be required to increase its allowance for loan losses. Such events could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In particular, as of December 31, 2022, BankPlus and BancPlus wholly owned subsidiary, Oakhurst Development, Inc. Oakhurst ), carry an aggregate of 4.2 million in other real estate owned OREO acquired by foreclosure or otherwise in satisfaction of debts previously contracted. Although foreclosures and acquisitions of OREO are expected, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in BancPlus market areas could force BancPlus to foreclose upon collateral, which could significantly impair the value of property carried in its OREO accounts, increase the loss associated with OREO and affect BancPlus ability to sell such real estate without additional loss. Further, as of December 31, 2022, 
 23

 BancPlus commercial real estate loans totaled 3.2 billion, or 55.6 , of its total loan portfolio. These loans expose BancPlus to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with BancPlus residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of BancPlus commercial real estate loan portfolio would require it to increase its provision for loan losses, which would reduce its profitability and could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Finally, since BancPlus may be forced to foreclose on the collateral and own the underlying real estate, BancPlus may be subjected to the costs and potential risks associated with the ownership of the real property. BancPlus inability to manage the amount of costs or size of the risks associated with the ownership of real estate, or write-downs in the value of OREO, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in some circumstances, which could diminish its liquidity. 
 
 Historically, BancPlus has originated its mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. When mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market, BancPlus is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The mortgage loan sale agreements require BancPlus to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event it breaches these representations and warranties. In addition, BancPlus may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, BancPlus liquidity could diminish, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. During 2022 and 2021 BancPlus was not required to repurchase any material amount of mortgage loans sold into the secondary market. 
 
 BancPlus allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of its loans will not be fully repaid in a timely manner or at all. Accordingly, BancPlus maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents management s judgment of probable losses and risks inherent in its loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of general economic conditions, diversification and seasoning of the loan portfolio, historic loss experience, identified credit problems, delinquency levels and adequacy of collateral. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently highly subjective and requires BancPlus to make significant estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus allowance for loan losses was 42.9 million. Inaccurate management assumptions, continued deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, temporary modifications, loan forgiveness, automatic forbearance and other factors, both within and outside of BancPlus control, may require it to increase its allowance for loan losses. In addition, federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their periodic examination, review the adequacy of BancPlus allowance for loan losses and may direct it to make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, BancPlus may need additional provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. If BancPlus is required to materially increase its level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increases could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus is dependent upon significant noninterest income, including deposit fees, some of which are under continual review by federal regulators and Congress. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, BancPlus noninterest income, including service charges on deposits, totaled 70.2 million and constituted 22.2 of total revenue. BancPlus transaction account deposit base generates a significant contribution to its noninterest income through service charges on deposit accounts, largely in the form of overdraft fees, non-sufficient fund fees, and other deposit related service charges. BankPlus offers a discretionary overdraft service and many of BancPlus deposit customers elect to use this service, which will generate overdraft fees when the service is accessed. Such programs are under continual scrutiny by federal bank regulators as well as consumer rights groups. While BancPlus continually adjusts to comply with industry best practices, federal bank regulators or Congress could impose additional restrictions on overdraft programs, which could reduce fees on the products offered. Because BancPlus derives a significant portion of its revenues from noninterest income, a reduction in such fees could have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 If BancPlus were to lose its status as a Community Development Financial Institution CDFI ), its ability to obtain grants and awards as a CDFI like those it has received in the past may be diminished or lost. 
 
 24 

Table of Content s 

 A portion of BancPlus community development business has historically been augmented by its status as a CDFI. CDFI status increases the potential for receiving grants and awards that, in turn, enable a financial institution to increase the level of community development financial services that it provides to communities. In the event BancPlus does not meet one or more of the annual recertification criteria, the CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may provide an opportunity for BancPlus to cure deficiencies prior to issuing a notice of termination of certification. From 2014 through the current period, BancPlus has received an aggregate of 11.8 million in grants made possible due to its status as a CDFI. Additionally, from time to time the CDFI Fund considers changes to the CDFI eligibility criteria, including through a request for public comment on changes to CDFI certification policies that the CDFI Fund released in May 2020. Any loss of BancPlus status as a CDFI, and the resulting inability to obtain certain grants and awards received in the past, could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The fair value of BancPlus investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of its control. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of BancPlus portfolio of available for sale investment securities was approximately 623.9 million, which included a net unrealized loss of approximately 57.4 million. Factors beyond BancPlus control can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions, defaults by the issuer, changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. Many factors could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized or unrealized losses in future periods. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary often requires complex, subjective judgments about whether there has been a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer, whether management has the intent or ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security, and other relevant factors. 
 
 Operational Risks 
 
 BancPlus risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks associated with new or existing lines of business and/or losses to BancPlus. 
 
 BancPlus risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which it is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. BancPlus framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Its risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss. If its risk management framework is not effective, BancPlus could suffer unexpected losses and its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. BancPlus may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. 
 
 BancPlus is dependent on the use of data and modeling in its management s decision-making, and faulty data or modeling approaches could negatively impact its decision-making ability or possibly subject it to regulatory scrutiny in the future. 
 
 The use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank decision-making, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in BancPlus operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in which BancPlus is dependent on models and the data that underlie them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While BancPlus is not currently subject to annual stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act or the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submissions, it currently utilizes stress testing for internal capital, credit and liquidity purposes and anticipates that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future. 
 
 BancPlus anticipates data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely and in differing applications. While BancPlus believes these quantitative techniques and approaches improve its decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact BancPlus decision-making ability or, if it becomes subject to regulatory stress-testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. BancPlus seeks to mitigate this risk by performing back-testing to analyze the accuracy of these techniques and approaches. Secondarily, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making. 
 
 The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and BancPlus may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or it may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology. 
 
 The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs while increasing customer service and convenience. BancPlus future success will depend, at least in part, upon its ability to address the 
 25 

Table of Content s 

 needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations as it continues to grow and expand its products and service offerings. BancPlus may experience operational challenges as it implements these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in BancPlus not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or incurring significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. 
 
 Many of BancPlus larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that BancPlus will be able to provide, which would put it at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, BancPlus may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent it is unable to provide such products and services. 
 
 BancPlus relies on third parties to provide key components of its business infrastructure, and a failure of these parties to perform for any reason could disrupt its operations or create liability exposure. 
 
 Third parties provide key components of BancPlus business infrastructure such as data processing, internet connections, network access, core application processing, statement production and other services. BancPlus business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, in particular due to the increase in remote work that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt BancPlus operations. Because its information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, BancPlus could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with BancPlus third party service providers could entail significant delay and expense. Moreover, the laws and policies on oversight of third-party service providers that the federal banking agencies implement impose additional compliance burdens on BankPlus and potential liability exposure. If BancPlus is unable to efficiently replace ineffective service providers, or if it experiences a significant, sustained, or repeated system failure or service denial, it could compromise its ability to operate effectively, damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, its employees and vendors. 
 
 In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, and the terms of any such transaction, BancPlus may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. BancPlus may also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information, whether fraudulent or inadvertent, may not be detected prior to funding. 
 
 In addition, one or more of BancPlus employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates BancPlus loan documentation, operations or systems. Employee errors and employee and client misconduct could subject BancPlus to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm its reputation. Misconduct by its employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from BancPlus, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of its clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions BancPlus takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject BancPlus to financial claims for negligence. 
 
 Whether a misrepresentation is made by a loan applicant or another third party, BancPlus generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of such misrepresentation. The sources of misrepresentations may also be difficult to locate, and BancPlus may be unable to recover any of the monetary losses it may suffer as a result of misrepresentations. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus financial results depend on management s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates. 
 
 The preparation of BancPlus financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of related revenues and expenses. Certain accounting policies are inherently based to a greater extent on estimates, assumptions and judgments of management and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally estimated. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses, accounting for income taxes, the determination of fair value for financial instruments, the impairment of tax credit investments and accounting for stock-based compensation. 
 26 

Table of Content s 

 This also includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the amortization/accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the FTC Merger. In particular, Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments is effective for BancPlus for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2023 and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with the CECL methodology. The CECL methodology requires management consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates and could result in a significant increase in the allowance for credit losses through the increased provision; result in negative adjustment to retained earnings and, correspondingly, BancPlus regulatory capital levels; and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year. Management s judgment and the data relied upon by management may be based on assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if the relevant factual assumptions are accurate, BancPlus decisions may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in the design or use of analytical tools used by management. Any such failures in BancPlus processes for producing accounting estimates and managing risks could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard-setting bodies, including the implementation of CECL, may affect our financial statements. 
 
 Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, the FASB or other accounting standard setting bodies adopt new accounting standard or amend existing standards. Market conditions often prompt these bodies to promulgate new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. 
 
 In particular, in the first quarter of 2023, BancPlus transitioned to CECL from the current incurred loss method and recognized a one-time, after-tax cumulative effect adjustment of 25.0 million to retained earnings. Regulations of the federal banking agencies provide an optional CECL transition provision that allows a banking organization that experiences a reduction in retained earnings as of its CECL adoption date to elect to phase in the regulatory capital impact of that reduction over a three-year period. Under the regulations, BancPlus is required to begin the three-year transition in the first fiscal year it has adopted CECL, which for BancPlus is 2023. As a result, the regulatory capital impact of BancPlus adoption of CECL is being phased in from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. 
 
 It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Appraisals and other valuation techniques BancPlus uses in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property, OREO and repossessed personal property may not accurately describe the net value of the asset. 
 
 In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, BancPlus generally requires an appraisal of the property. However, in BancPlus rural markets, the ability to secure an appraisal may be difficult due to a lack of appraisers or lack of comparable transactions. An appraisal or other evaluation is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal or evaluation is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan is made. As a result, BancPlus may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness if it forecloses on and sells the relevant property. In addition, BancPlus relies on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of its OREO and personal property that it acquires through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations is inaccurate, BancPlus consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of its OREO, and its allowance for loan losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. 
 
 Compliance and Regulatory Risks 
 
 BancPlus is subject to environmental liability risk associated with its lending activities. 
 
 In the course of its business, BancPlus may purchase real estate, or it may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, BancPlus could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. BancPlus may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if BancPlus is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any 
 27 

Table of Content s 

 significant environmental liabilities could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 If BancPlus fails to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that BancPlus maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. BancPlus expects that the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and associated rules and regulations will continue to increase its legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on its personnel, systems and resources. 
 
 BancPlus current controls and any new controls that it develops may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in its business. Further, weaknesses in BancPlus disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in the implementation or improvement of such controls, could harm BancPlus results of operations or cause it to fail to meet its reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of BancPlus financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of BancPlus internal control over financial reporting that it will eventually be required to include in its periodic reports that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 
 BancPlus independent registered public accounting firm is not required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards to formally attest to the effectiveness of BancPlus internal control over financial reporting until after BancPlus is no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ), but no later than December 31, 2025. At such time, BancPlus independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which BancPlus internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus use of third-party vendors and its other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention. 
 
 BancPlus regularly uses third-party vendors in its business, and it relies on some of these vendors for critical functions including, but not limited to, its core processing function and mortgage broker relationships. Third-party relationships are subject to demanding regulatory requirements and attention by bank regulators, and these regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party relationships with new guidance. BancPlus expects its regulators to hold BancPlus responsible for deficiencies in its oversight or control of its third-party vendor relationships and in the performance of the parties with which it has these relationships. As a result, if BancPlus regulators conclude that it has not exercised adequate oversight and control over its third-party vendors or that such vendors have not performed adequately, BancPlus could be subject to administrative penalties or fines as well as requirements for consumer remediation, any of which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Reliance by third-party vendors on remote working relationships with their employees may affect the vendors ability to satisfy regulatory standards and to provide services to us. 
 
 BancPlus industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus operates in a highly regulated environment, and the laws and regulations that govern its operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or its failure to comply with them, could subject it to regulatory action or penalties. 
 
 BancPlus and BankPlus are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the United States, rather than shareholders or counterparties. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which BancPlus and BankPlus can engage, require BancPlus to dedicate significant resources to its AML program and OFAC compliance, limit the dividends or distributions that BankPlus can pay to BancPlus, and that BancPlus can pay to its shareholders, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on BancPlus that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in BancPlus capital than GAAP would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. BancPlus failure to comply with these laws and 
 28 

Table of Content s 

 regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject BancPlus to restrictions on its business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect its results of operations, capital base and the value of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive. Any of these laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework applicable to BancPlus industry, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to stringent capital requirements, which may result in lower returns on equity, require BancPlus to raise additional capital, limit growth opportunities or result in regulatory restrictions. 
 
 BancPlus and BankPlus are subject to stringent capital adequacy requirements of the federal banking agencies. These regulations limit how BancPlus and BankPlus use their capital, pay capital distributions and make discretionary bonus payments to executives and may make certain activities less profitable. 
 
 If BankPlus does not meet certain minimum capital requirements as described in Note 19 Regulatory Matters to our Consolidated Financial Statements, it will be subject to prompt corrective action by the FDIC. Prompt corrective action can include progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions. While BancPlus is not subject to formal capital planning requirements at its size, it prepares a capital plan. Even if BancPlus satisfies the objectives of its capital plan and meets minimum capital requirements, it is possible that BancPlus regulators may ask it to raise additional capital which could require BancPlus to raise additional capital or reduce its operations. Even if BancPlus satisfies all applicable regulatory capital minimums, its regulators could ask it, and in some cases, require it, to maintain capital levels which are significantly in excess of those minimums. BancPlus ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on its financial condition and performance. Accordingly, BancPlus cannot assure you that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to it. If BancPlus fails to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, it could be subject to enforcement actions or other regulatory consequences, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 
 
 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of direct or indirect negative consequences, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or, results of operations. 
 
 In addition, financial institutions face scrutiny on actions and policies that are deemed to adversely impact consumers under the Dodd-Frank Act s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act s prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Bank regulators, including the CFPB, are responsible for enforcing these prohibitions against banking organizations. These prohibitions have been applied to prohibit perceived customer abuse in connection with a range of products, services, and practices, including account openings and fees charged where inadequate or no services are rendered but for which charges were imposed, as well as other instances where consumers may have been misled through bank disclosures. In addition, the enforcement priorities of the agencies enforcing consumer protection laws have evolved over time and may continue to do so. 
 
 In addition, the CFPB has rulemaking authority, including with respect to prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and the approach of the CFPB to interpretation and enforcement of the consumer financial protection laws has varied considerably over the years depending on its leadership, and it is difficult to predict what actions the CFPB may take in the future. Such actions could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures, and could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. These changes could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Federal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of BancPlus business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and its failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which it is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations could result in regulatory action or penalties. 
 
 The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the MDBCF periodically conduct examinations of BancPlus business, including its compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that 
 29 

Table of Content s 

 BancPlus financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of its operations had become unsatisfactory, or that BancPlus and/or BankPlus were in violation of any law or regulation, the agency may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in BancPlus capital, to restrict its growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against it or BankPlus or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors (among other conditions), to terminate BankPlus deposit insurance and place it into receivership or conservatorship. Any such regulatory action could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 New activities and expansion require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them, or failure by BankPlus to perform satisfactorily on its CRA evaluations may restrict BancPlus growth. 
 
 From time to time, BancPlus may complement and expand its business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, BancPlus must receive state and federal regulatory approval before it can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, BancPlus financial condition, its future prospects, and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the record of the parties depository institution subsidiaries under the CRA and the effectiveness of the parties in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to BancPlus, or at all. BancPlus may also be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to BancPlus or, if acceptable to BancPlus, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. 
 
 Additionally, the federal banking agencies released a rule proposal in May 2022 that may make it more challenging and/or costly for insured depository institutions to achieve an Outstanding or Satisfactory CRA rating. If BankPlus is unable to maintain at least a Satisfactory CRA rating, its ability to complete the acquisition of another financial institution or open a new branch will be adversely impacted. If BankPlus received an overall CRA rating of less than Satisfactory, the FDIC would not re-evaluate its rating until its next CRA examination, which may not occur for several more years, and it is possible that a low CRA rating would not improve in the future. BankPlus received a rating of Outstanding in its most recent CRA performance evaluation, as of March 22, 2021. 
 
 In addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, BancPlus may continue de novo branching as a part of its organic growth strategy. De novo branching and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals, or the imposition of certain conditions or restrictions as a part of such approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches could impact BancPlus business plans and restrict its growth. 
 
 Federal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict BancPlus ability to originate certain mortgage loans, increase BancPlus risk of liability with respect to such loans, or increase the time and expense associated with the foreclosure process or prevent BancPlus from foreclosing at all. 
 
 Federal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory. These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is BancPlus policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to BancPlus lending and loan investment activities. They increase BancPlus cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent BancPlus from making certain loans and cause BancPlus to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that BancPlus does make. 
 
 Additionally, consumer protection initiatives or changes in state or federal law may substantially increase the time and expenses associated with the foreclosure process or prevent BancPlus from foreclosing at all. While historically the states in which BancPlus operates have had foreclosure laws that are favorable to lenders, a number of states in recent years have either considered or adopted foreclosure reform laws that make it substantially more difficult and expensive for lenders to foreclose on properties in default, and BancPlus cannot be certain that the states in which it operates will not adopt similar legislation in the future. Additionally, federal regulators have prosecuted a number of mortgage servicing companies for alleged consumer law violations. If additional new state or federal laws or regulations are ultimately enacted that significantly raise the cost of foreclosure or raise outright barriers, such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operation.

 An expansion of federal, state and local regulations and/or changes in the licensing of loan servicing, collections or other aspects of BancPlus business and sales of loans to third parties may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance and subject BancPlus to litigation. 
 
 BancPlus services consumer loans it holds on its balance sheet. The servicing of consumer loans is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, BancPlus may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements, which may further adversely affect BancPlus. In addition, were BancPlus to be subject to regulatory investigation or regulatory action regarding BancPlus loan modification and foreclosure practices, this could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 In addition, BancPlus has sold loans to third parties. In connection with these sales, BancPlus or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties, breaches of which may result in a requirement that BancPlus repurchase the loans, or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties. These aspects of BancPlus business or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could possibly lead to civil and criminal liability; loss of licensure; damage to BancPlus reputation in the industry; fines and penalties and litigation, including class action lawsuits; and administrative enforcement actions. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Increases in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely affect BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The deposits of BankPlus are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. BankPlus regular assessments are determined by the level of its assessment base and its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels, other financial measurements and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. Moreover, the FDIC has the unilateral power to change deposit insurance assessment rates and the manner in which deposit insurance is calculated and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions, and we cannot predict what insurance assessments will be in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of total estimated insured deposits grew very rapidly while the funds in the DIF grew at a normal rate, causing the DIF reserve ratio to fall below the statutory minimum of 1.35 . The FDIC adopted a restoration plan in September 2020, which it amended in June 2022, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35 by September 30, 2028. On October 18, 2022 the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates for insured depository institutions by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio of the DIF meets or exceeds 2 . As a result of the new rule, the FDIC insurance costs of insured depository institutions, including BankPlus, will generally increase. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or premiums, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce BancPlus profitability or limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could adversely affect BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, BancPlus earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and has indicated that it expects to continue to raise rates, changes to its monetary policy and the timing of them are not certain. The effects of such policies upon BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations cannot be predicted. 
 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve may require BancPlus to commit capital resources to support BankPlus. Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy, which was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, BancPlus is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to BankPlus and to commit resources to support BankPlus. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require BancPlus to make capital injections into BankPlus at times when BancPlus may not be inclined to do so, including when either BancPlus or BankPlus is experiencing financial distress, and may charge BancPlus with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit such resources. 
 31

BancPlus may be required to borrow the funds or to raise additional equity capital to make a capital injection to BankPlus. In the event of BancPlus bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by BancPlus to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of BancPlus general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts BancPlus operations and capital requirements. 
 
 The federal banking regulators have issued guidance regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending directed at institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending portfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions the commercial real estate loans of which exceed certain percentages of capital may have commercial real estate concentration risk and will be subject to further regulatory scrutiny with respect to their risk management practices for commercial real estate lending. Increases in BancPlus commercial real estate lending, particularly as BancPlus expands into metropolitan markets and makes more of these loans, could subject BancPlus to additional supervisory scrutiny. BancPlus cannot guarantee that any risk management practices it implements will be effective to prevent losses relating to its commercial real estate portfolio. Management has implemented controls to monitor BancPlus commercial real estate lending concentrations, but BancPlus cannot predict the extent to which this guidance will impact its operations or capital requirements. In addition, BancPlus capital requirements could increase to the extent its commercial real estate loans are deemed to be high volatility commercial real estate exposures, as defined in capital adequacy regulations. 
 
 Reforms to and planned discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate may adversely affect our business. 
 
 On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023 (excluding 1-week U.S. LIBOR and 2-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021). Given LIBOR s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to BancPlus. The U.S. federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR by no later than December 31, 2021 and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate, and have emphasized the expectation that supervised institutions with LIBOR exposure continue to progress toward an orderly transition away from LIBOR. 
 
 The Federal Reserve, based on the recommendations of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has begun publishing the SOFR, which is intended to replace LIBOR. Additionally, on March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, which provides for the substitution of SOFR in any LIBOR-based contract that does not include clear fallback language, once LIBOR is discontinued. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the United States. SOFR differs from LIBOR in a number of respects, including that SOFR is deemed a credit risk-free rate while LIBOR incorporates an evaluation of credit risk. In addition, the SOFR methodology has not been tested for an extended period of time, which may limit market acceptance of the use of SOFR. In December the Federal Reserve released Regulation ZZ implementing the LIBOR Act to govern legacy instruments issued under LIBOR with no imbedded rate replacement language. It applies automatically to TRUPS with no provision to substitute a rate and provides a corresponding SOFR rate with an adjustment. 
 
 BancPlus has selected SOFR as its primary replacement index for existing LIBOR-based loans. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR, if not sufficiently planned for and managed by BancPlus, could adversely affect BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operation by, among other things, resulting in BancPlus incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and subjecting BancPlus to disputes or additional scrutiny in connection with its use of substitute indices. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 There is no organized public trading market for BancPlus common stock, and there can be no assurance that a public market will develop. 
 
 There is no organized trading market for the shares of common stock of BancPlus. In connection with the FTC Merger, BancPlus had agreed with FTC to use best efforts to complete an initial underwritten public offering of its common stock within 18 months of the date and time when statutory share exchange between BancPlus and FTC became effective. However, there can be no expectation that a public market for BancPlus common stock will develop. BancPlus is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and, as a result, BancPlus may consider the development of a public market for its common stock.

 BancPlus dividend policy may change without notice, and its future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions. 
 
 Holders of BancPlus common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as the board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. However, the amount and frequency of cash dividends, if any, will be determined by the BancPlus board of directors after consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) BancPlus historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations; (2) BancPlus capital levels and needs; (3) any acquisitions or potential acquisitions that BancPlus is considering; (4) contractual, statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations; (5) general economic conditions; and (6) other factors deemed relevant by the BancPlus board of directors. BancPlus ability to pay dividends may also be limited on account of BancPlus outstanding indebtedness and preferred stock, as it generally must make payments on its junior subordinated debentures, its outstanding indebtedness, and, beginning in 2025, its outstanding preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on BancPlus common stock. Finally, because BancPlus primary asset is its investment in the stock of BankPlus, BancPlus is dependent upon dividends from BankPlus to pay its operating expenses, satisfy its obligations and pay dividends on BancPlus common stock, and BankPlus ability to pay dividends on its common stock will substantially depend upon its earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of BankPlus. There are numerous laws and banking regulations and guidance that limit BancPlus and BankPlus ability to pay dividends. Therefore, there can be no assurance that BancPlus will pay any dividends to holders of its common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends. 
 
 BancPlus corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to BancPlus, could make a takeover more difficult, which could adversely affect the value of BancPlus common stock. 
 
 Certain provisions of the BancPlus articles and the BancPlus By-Laws (the BancPlus bylaws as well as corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of BancPlus organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of BancPlus shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to BancPlus: 
 
 enable the BancPlus board of directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock without further shareholder approval; 
 enable the BancPlus board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board of directors; 
 enable the BancPlus board of directors to increase the size of the board of directors and to fill vacancies caused by an increase in the number of directors, a director s removal, resignation, death, failure to qualify, or any other cause; 
 divide the BancPlus board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; 
 do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; 
 enable the BancPlus board of directors to amend the BancPlus bylaws without shareholder approval; 
 require a two-thirds vote of BancPlus shareholders to modify the sections of the BancPlus articles addressing the number, term and removal of its directors, the filling of vacancies on the BancPlus board of directors, the calling of special meetings of shareholders, limitations on certain personal liabilities of directors, director and officer indemnification and the amendment, adoption, alternation or repeal of the BancPlus bylaws; 
 do not permit informal shareholder action by less than unanimous written consent; 
 prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings; 
 establish an advance notice procedure for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and 
 require prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of its organization. 
 
 These provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including under circumstances in which BancPlus shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the value of BancPlus shares. 
 
 The BancPlus bylaws designate the Madison County Chancery Court of the State of Mississippi as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by BancPlus shareholders, which could limit BancPlus shareholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with BancPlus or its directors, officers or employees. 
 
 The BancPlus bylaws provide that, unless BancPlus consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Madison County Chancery Court of the State of Mississippi will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on BancPlus behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of BancPlus to BancPlus or its shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Mississippi Business Corporation Act, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of BancPlus will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of the BancPlus bylaws described in the preceding sentence provided, however, that shareholders will not be deemed to have waived BancPlus compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 33 

Table of Content s 

 BancPlus has chosen the Madison County Chancery Court of the State of Mississippi as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because its principal executive offices are located in Ridgeland, Mississippi. BancPlus recognizes that the federal district court forum selection clause may impose additional litigation costs on shareholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the shareholders do not reside in or near Mississippi. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with BancPlus or its directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against BancPlus and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the BancPlus bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, BancPlus may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. The Madison County Chancery Court of the State of Mississippi may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a shareholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to BancPlus than BancPlus shareholders. BancPlus forum selection provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and the Exchange Act. To the extent the provision could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the provision in such respect, and BancPlus shareholders cannot waive BancPlus compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 
 There are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies that may discourage investors from purchasing shares of BancPlus common stock. 
 
 With limited exceptions, federal regulations generally prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be acting in concert from, directly or indirectly, acquiring 10 or more (or more than 5 if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of BancPlus voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of BancPlus without prior notice or application to, and the approval of, the Federal Reserve. Companies investing in banks and bank holding companies receive additional review and may be required to become bank holding companies, and therefore become subject to regulatory supervision. Accordingly, prospective investors must be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of BancPlus common stock. These provisions could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire significant interests in BancPlus or in attempting to acquire control of BancPlus, which, in turn, could adversely affect the value of BancPlus common stock. 
 
 Because BancPlus has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an emerging growth company, BancPlus consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards, and BancPlus may incur additional costs when it is no longer an emerging growth company. 
 
 BancPlus is currently an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. This election allows BancPlus to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, BancPlus consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards and investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations in comparison to other public companies. This may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of BancPlus common stock. BancPlus cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because BancPlus plans to continue to rely on this exemption. 
 
 Additionally, beginning with the time BancPlus is no longer an emerging growth company, but no later than December 31, 2025, BancPlus will be required to engage its independent registered public accounting firm to audit and opine on the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This process will require significant documentation of policies, procedures and systems, and review of that documentation and testing of BancPlus internal control over financial reporting by its internal auditing and accounting staff and its independent registered public accounting firm. This process will require considerable time and attention from management, which could prevent BancPlus from successfully implementing its business initiatives and improving its business, financial condition or results of operations, strain its internal resources, and increase its operating costs. BancPlus may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, including those associated with SEC reporting, and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 BancPlus business strategy includes growth, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected if BancPlus fails to grow or fails to manage growth effectively. 
 
 34 

Table of Content s 

 BancPlus business has grown at a steady pace, but it may not be able to maintain its historical rate of growth, which could have an adverse effect on its ability to successfully implement its business strategy. BancPlus primary strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions of banking teams or other financial institutions. BancPlus may be unable to execute on aspects of its growth strategy to sustain its historical rate of growth, or BancPlus may be unable to grow at all. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of BancPlus operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. The success of BancPlus strategy also depends on its ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including its ability to adapt existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If BancPlus fails to build infrastructure sufficient to support rapid growth or fails to implement one or more aspects of its strategy, it may be unable to maintain historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 In particular, BancPlus business strategy includes evaluating strategic opportunities to grow through de novo branching, and it believes that banking location expansion has been meaningful to its growth since inception. Over the last five years, BancPlus has entered two new markets where it opened five new locations. De novo branching carries with it certain potential risks, including significant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an inability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking location and successfully integrate and promote BancPlus corporate culture; poor market reception for de novo banking locations established in markets where BancPlus does not have a preexisting reputation; challenges posed by local economic conditions; challenges associated with securing attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with BancPlus growth through de novo branching could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus may pursue acquisitions in the future, which could expose it to financial, execution and operational risks. 
 
 BancPlus may from time to time consider acquisition opportunities that BancPlus believes complement its activities and have the ability to enhance its profitability. BancPlus may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into the existing operations, or expand into new markets. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability, or productivity comparable with those achieved by BancPlus existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. BancPlus acquisition activities could be material to its business and involve a number of risks, including those associated with: 
 
 the diversion of management attention from the operation of its existing business to identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions; 
 the ability to attract funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances; 
 the use of inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets; 
 the ability to maintain asset quality; 
 the adequacy of due diligence and the potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities related to the acquisition; 
 the retention of customers and key personnel, including bankers; 
 the timing and uncertainty associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals; 
 the risk of losing its CDFI status due to the addition of markets that do not qualify as low- or moderate-income markets; 
 the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on its results of operations; 
 the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; and 
 the maintenance of adequate regulatory capital. 
 
 BancPlus may not properly ascertain all such risks prior to an acquisition or prior to such a risk impacting BancPlus while integrating an acquired company. As a result, difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus relies heavily on its executive management team and other key personnel, and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely impact its business or reputation. 
 
 BancPlus success depends in large part on the performance of its key personnel, including bankers, as well as on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and BancPlus may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. BancPlus may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining bankers of its desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions. In particular, many of BancPlus competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, BancPlus may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether new 
 35 

Table of Content s 

 bankers or other key personnel will be profitable or effective. BancPlus may not be successful in retaining its key personnel, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of its key personnel could have an adverse effect on its business because of their skills, knowledge of and business relationships within BancPlus primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any of BancPlus key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, BancPlus may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to BancPlus, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 BancPlus ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of its business. 
 
 BancPlus has benefited from strong relationships with and among its customers. As a result, its reputation is one of the most valuable components of its business. BancPlus growth over the past several years has depended on attracting new customers from competing financial institutions and increasing its market share, primarily by its involvement in its primary markets and word-of-mouth advertising, rather than on growth in the market for banking services in its primary markets. As such, BancPlus strives to enhance its reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share its core values of being an integral part of the communities it serves and delivering superior service to its customers. If BancPlus reputation is negatively affected by the actions of its employees; litigation or regulatory actions; compliance failures; any perceived weakness in its financial strength or liquidity; technological, cybersecurity or other security breaches resulting in improper disclosure of client or personal information; or otherwise, its existing relationships may be damaged. BancPlus could lose some of its existing customers, including groups of large customers who have relationships with each other, and BancPlus may not be successful in attracting new customers. Any such developments could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in the event BancPlus determines it to be in its best financial interest to close branches, BancPlus could suffer reputational damage, including from potential community opposition, as well as loss of customers who choose not to transfer business to a different branch. In addition, there is a financial risk that the retired branch real estate could not be sold without loss. 
 
 BancPlus is subject to claims, litigation, and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of banking and lending. 
 
 BancPlus may become involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Further, BancPlus may in the future be subject to consent orders or other enforcement actions by its regulators. BancPlus may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding its current and/or prior business activities. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject BancPlus to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change its business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to its reputation. BancPlus involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in its favor, could also cause significant harm to its reputation and divert management s attention from the operation of its business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. For example, BancPlus is subject to litigation related to intellectual property. Banking and other financial services companies, such as BancPlus , rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, BancPlus may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to BancPlus operations and distracting to management. The outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Unauthorized access, cyber-crime and other threats to data security may subject BancPlus to regulatory action or penalties, require significant resources, harm BancPlus reputation, and otherwise cause harm to its business. 
 
 BancPlus business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that it maintains and in those maintained by third parties with whom BancPlus contracts to provide data services. BancPlus also maintains important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about its employees and information relating to its operations. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing BancPlus to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure its data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory privacy and other requirements. It is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk posed by changing technologies, as well as criminals that are intent on committing cyber-crime. The increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals and terrorists make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. Controls employed by BancPlus information technology department and its other employees and vendors could prove inadequate. BancPlus could also experience a breach due to intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal sources, software bugs, other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any 
 36 

Table of Content s 

 of these threats, BancPlus customer accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. BancPlus systems and those of its third party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond its or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, viruses and malware. 
 
 BancPlus is also subject to complex and evolving laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage BancPlus reputation and subject it to regulatory action or penalties. For example, BancPlus business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things, imposes certain limitations on its ability to share nonpublic personal information about its customers with nonaffiliated third parties; requires that BancPlus provide certain disclosures to customers about its information collection, sharing and security practices; affords customers the right to opt out of any information sharing by BancPlus with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and requires that BancPlus develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on its size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information BancPlus processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. 
 
 Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. For example, a final rule that the federal banking agencies issued in November 2021 requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred. Ensuring that BancPlus collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase its costs. Furthermore, BancPlus may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with BancPlus, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or other were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), BancPlus could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of BancPlus measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause BancPlus to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce its revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject BancPlus to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage its reputation and otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 A breach of BancPlus security that results in unauthorized access to its data could expose it to a disruption or challenges relating to its daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage, any of which could have an adverse effect on BancPlus business, financial condition or results of operations. Such financial losses incurred may not be covered under applicable general liability insurance coverage or current cyber-insurance coverages. The insurance market for policies to cover cyber-related fraud is in constant flux and there is no assurance adequate coverage has been or may be obtained.

Our loan portfolio was comprised of 74.0 commercial loans and 26.0 consumer loans for the same period. BancPlus currently holds meaningful market share in a number of attractive markets in Mississippi, including the number three position based on deposits in the Jackson, Mississippi MSA as of June 30, 2022, and we believe we are well-positioned for future growth.

Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion of BancPlus results of operations compares the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021. For additional information on BancPlus financial condition as of December 31, 2021 and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 60.8 million and 56.5 million, respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0.95 and 1.13 , respectively. BancPlus annualized return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 10.75 and 14.99 , respectively. 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. BancPlus generates interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities. BancPlus incurs interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other forms of indebtedness. Net interest income typically is the most significant contributor to BancPlus net income. To evaluate net interest income, BancPlus measures and monitors: (i) yields on its loans and other interest earning assets; (ii) the costs of its deposits and other funding sources; (iii) its net interest spread; and (iv) its net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
 
 Changes in market interest rates and interest BancPlus earns on interest earning assets or pays on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders equity, usually have the largest impact on periodic changes in its net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. BancPlus measures net interest income before and after the provision for loan losses that BancPlus maintains. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest income was 246.4 million an increase of 65.2 million, or 36.0 , compared to interest income of 181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income was primarily the result of increased interest-earning assets as a result of the FTC Merger and organic loan growth particularly in commercial real estate. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense was 26.6 million, an increase of 13.6 million, or 103.8 , compared to interest expense of 13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of increased interest-bearing liabilities as a result of the FTC Merger and the rising interest rate environment seen in the second half of 2022.

Table of Content s 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income was 219.8 million, an increase of 51.7 million, or 30.7 , compared to net interest income of 168.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 8 basis points to 3.67 from 3.59 for the same period of 2021 primarily as a result of the rising interest rate environment seen in the second half of 2022. 
 Our average interest earning assets at December 31, 2022, increased 1,309.3 million, or 27.94 , to 5.995 billion from 4.685 billion at December 31, 2021. BancPlus average interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2022 increased 796.6 million, or 24.56 , to 4.040 billion from 3.243 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase in BancPlus average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the FTC Merger and organic loan growth particularly in commercial real estate. The ratio of BancPlus average interest earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities was 148.4 and 144.5 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 BancPlus average interest earning assets produced a tax-equivalent yield of 4.11 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.87 for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.66 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 0.40 for the year ended December 31, 2021. These year over year increases in yields reflect the rising interest rate environment seen in the second half of 2022. 
 Average Balances and Yields 
 The following tables show, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the average balances of each principal category of BancPlus assets, liabilities and shareholders equity, and an analysis of net interest income. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. These tables are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, if applicable.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to the outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. The change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between periods to average balances outstanding in the earlier period. The change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the later

 Provision for Loan Losses 
 
 The provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that, based on BancPlus judgment, is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that, in management s judgment, is appropriate under relevant accounting guidance. The determination of the provision for loan losses is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for loan losses was 1.4 million compared to 9.1 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 7.7 million, or 84.9 . The decrease was primarily attributable to improved credity quality in the loan portfolio which resulted in a lower provision under the incurred loss model.

Noninterest Income 
 
 Noninterest income consists of: (i) service charges on deposit accounts; (ii) mortgage origination income; (iii) debit card interchange; (iv) securities gains, net; (v) income from fiduciary activities; (vi) ATM income; (vii) brokerage and insurance fees and commissions; (viii) life insurance income; (ix) CDFI grants; and (x) other noninterest income. 
 
 BancPlus income from service charges on deposit accounts and debit card interchange fees is largely affected by the volume, growth and type of deposits BancPlus holds, which are impacted by prevailing market conditions for BancPlus deposit products, market interest rates, marketing efforts, and other factors. 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts include fees and miscellaneous charges on deposit products offered by BancPlus. Mortgage origination income represents the gains recorded on the sale of mortgages originated by BancPlus. Debit card interchange represents income from the use of check cards by our customers. Income from fiduciary activities includes retirement and management fee income from our wealth management group. ATM income is comprised of fees from our ATM network. Other income includes various types of income including gains on sale of other real estate owned, personalized check sales, and wire transfer fees. 
 
 Noninterest income was 70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 75.3 million for the same period of 2021, a decrease of 5.1 million, or 6.8 , primarily due to decreases in life insurance income of 4.0 million, or 61.2 ; mortgage origination income of 2.0 million, or 23.8 ; CDFI grants of 1.8 million, or 80.2 , and other income of 760,000, or 15.5 ; partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of 3.4 million, or 13.0 . 
 
 The following table presents the major components of noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021: 
 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Change Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 29,952 26,508 3,444 13.0 Mortgage origination income 6,510 8,544 (2,034) (23.8) Debit card interchange 10,150 10,164 (14) (0.1) Securities gains, net 14 (14) (100.0) Income from fiduciary activities 7,607 7,569 38 0.5 ATM income 6,127 6,377 (250) (3.9) Brokerage and insurance fees and commissions 2,690 2,399 291 12.1 Life insurance income 2,563 6,601 (4,038) (61.2) CDFI grants 443 2,241 (1,798) (80.2) Other income 4,155 4,915 (760) (15.5) Total 70,197 75,332 (5,135) (6.8) 
 
 Service charges on deposit accounts increased 3.4 million, or 13.0 , to 30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 26.5 million for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of deposit accounts held and a higher volume of transactions due to the FTC Merger. 
 
 Mortgage origination income decreased 2.0 million, or 23.8 , to 6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 8.5 million for the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of a decreased mortgage origination activity in 2022 as refinancing activity has slowed in the higher interest rate environment seen in the second half of 2022. 
 
 Life insurance income decreased 4.0 million, or 61.2 , to 2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 6.6 million for the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily related to death benefits paid in the prior year period on policies held by BancPlus. 
 
 CDFI grant income decreased 1.8 million, or 80.2 , to 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.2 million for the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of a grant received in the prior year period related to the CDFI Rapid Response Program, which was created in 2021 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide capital for CDFI designated banks to respond to the economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Other income decreased 760,000, or 15.5 , to 4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.9 million for the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily the result of higher gains on the sale of other real estate owned during the prior year period. 
 
 Noninterest Expense 
 
 Noninterest expense includes: (i) salaries and employee benefits expenses; (ii) net occupancy expenses; (iii) furniture, equipment, and data processing expenses; (iv) marketing and promotional expenses; (v) other real estate expenses and losses; (vi) professional fees; and (vii) other expenses. 
 
 Salaries and employee benefits expenses includes compensation, employee benefits and tax expenses for BancPlus personnel. Net occupancy expenses include depreciation expense on BancPlus owned properties, lease expense on its leased properties and other occupancy-related expenses. Furniture and equipment expenses include depreciation and maintenance and other expenses related to its furniture, fixtures and equipment. Data processing expenses include costs related to maintenance and monitoring of its systems and expenses paid to its third-party data processing system providers. Marketing and promotional expenses include costs for advertising, promotions and sponsorships. Other real estate expenses and losses include taxes, insurance, maintenance and other expenses related to BancPlus foreclosed properties. Professional fees include accounting and auditing, consulting and legal fees. Other expenses include expenses associated with FDIC assessments, MDBCF assessments, communications, travel, meals, training, supplies and postage. 
 
 Noninterest expenses generally increase as BancPlus grows its business. Noninterest expenses have increased commensurate with our growth over the past few years as BancPlus has grown organically and through our previously disclosed mergers with FTC, in which BancPlus acquired FTC, the holding company of FBT and FTC was merged with and into BancPlus, with BancPlus surviving the merger, and FBT was merged with and into BankPlus, with BankPlus surviving the merger, which closed on March 1, 2022, and our previously disclosed merger with State Capital Corp. SCC ), in which BancPlus acquired SCC, the holding company of State Bank Trust Company State Bank by a statutory share exchange and SCC was merged with and into BancPlus, with BancPlus surviving the merger (the SCC Holding Company Merger ), and State Bank was merged with and into BankPlus, with BankPlus surviving the merger (together with the SCC Holding Company Merger, the SCC Merger ), which closed on April 1, 2020. Additionally, BancPlus has built out and modernized its operational infrastructure and implemented its plan to build an efficient, technology-driven banking operation with capacity for growth. BancPlus continues to focus efforts on supporting growth through sales efforts, product development, marketing and promotion, as well as investing in technology and its branch network, while also seeking to improve productivity and maintain appropriate cost structure and customer service levels. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, noninterest expense totaled 211.2 million, an increase of 46.7 million, or 28.4 , from 164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits expenses of 25.5 million, or 26.1 ; furniture, equipment and data processing of 5.4 million, or 22.0 ; other expenses of 5.2 million, or 26.8 ; professional fees of 4.2 million, or 108.5 ; net occupancy expenses of 3.7 million, or 25.6 ; and marketing and promotional expenses of 2.3 million, or 59.5 .

 Salaries and employee benefits expenses was the largest component of noninterest expense, representing 58.2 and 59.2 of total noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, salaries and employee benefits expense increased 25.5 million, or 26.1 , to 122.9 million as compared to 97.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily due the FTC Merger as well as to normal annual salary increases for employees. 
 
 Net occupancy expenses increased 3.7 million, or 25.6 , to 18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 14.5 million for the same period of 2021. The primary reason for the increase was increased depreciation and rent expense as a result of the FTC Merger. 
 
 Furniture, equipment and data processing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 29.8 million, an increase of 5.4 million, or 22.0 , compared to 24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased data processing and equipment maintenance expenses in the current year period resulting from our recent core system upgrade as well as costs associated with conversion of FTC customers to our core system. 
 
 Marketing and promotional expenses increased 2.3 million, or 59.5 , to 6.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.9 million for the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to increased community sponsorship expense in the current year period as a result of the FTC Merger. 
 
 Professional fees increased 4.2 million, or 108.5 , to 8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of advisory fees as well as increased legal and accounting expenses in connection with the FTC Merger. 
 
 Other expenses increased 5.2 million, or 26.8 , to 24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 19.5 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in FDIC assessments, amortization of intangible assets, and other expenses resulting from the FTC Merger. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 
 The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes. Fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses for income tax purposes, the mix of BancPlus taxable and tax-free investments and loans, and its overall taxable income. 
 
 BancPlus recorded income tax expense of 16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 13.4 million for the same period of 2021. BancPlus effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 21.5 compared to 19.2 for the same period of 2021. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in income tax expense over the prior year period was primarily the result of larger income before taxes in the current year. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was the result of the Company taking advantage of tax credits offered by Mississippi and non-taxable life insurance proceeds in the prior year period. 

Financial Condition 
 
 The following discussion compares BancPlus financial condition as of December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2021. 
 
 Assets 
 
 Total assets at December 31, 2022 were 7.035 billion, an increase of 1.839 billion over total assets of 5.196 billion at December 31, 2021. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased 526.3 million, or 79.2 , to 137.9 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 664.2 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to decreases in interest bearing deposits with banks. Total loans increased 2.205 billion, or 60.9 , to 5.824 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.619 billion at December 31, 2021 as a result of the FTC Merger and organic loan growth particularly in commercial real estate. Investment securities increased 37.9 million, or 5.9 , from 648.3 million at December 31, 2021 to 686.2 million at December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of securities acquired in the FTC Merger.

 Investment Securities Portfolio 
 
 BancPlus investment securities portfolio, which consists primarily of U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate investments, is used as a source of liquidity and serves as collateral for certain types of deposits. BancPlus manages its investment securities portfolio according to a written investment policy. Balances in BancPlus investment securities portfolio change over time based on its funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. BancPlus liquidity levels take into account anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credit and are maintained at levels management believes ensure flexibility in meeting its anticipated funding needs. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, 9.1 of BancPlus investment securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity and 90.9 was classified as available for sale. As of December 31, 2021, 11.1 of BancPlus investment securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity and 88.9 was classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale increased 47.3 million, or 8.2 , from 576.6 million at December 31, 2021 to 623.9 million at December 31, 2022. Early in the period, BancPlus took advantage of the steeper yield curve to invest excess liquidity. BancPlus used a disciplined approach to build a ladder of non-callable state tax-exempt agency bonds. As market conditions allow, BancPlus expects to continue this strategy to enhance net interest margin and provide predictable cash flows for future loan demand. See Note 3 Investment Securities to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the impact of this transfer.

 The objective of BancPlus investment policy is to invest funds to provide sufficient liquidity, optimize the total return of the portfolio, mitigate interest rate risk, and meet pledging requirements. In doing so, BancPlus balances the market and credit risks against the potential investment return, makes most investments compatible with the pledge requirements of any deposits of public funds, and maintains compliance with regulatory investment requirements. BancPlus investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short-term securities purchased to provide needed liquidity and longer term securities purchased to generate stable income over periods of interest rate fluctuations.

 Additionally, BancPlus enters into various other transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers including commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit beyond current funding are agreements to lend to a customer 
 51 

Table of Content s 

 as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. At December 31, 2022, BancPlus had total off-balance sheet commitments of 1.451 billion. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Federal regulations and BancPlus internal policies require that BancPlus utilize an asset classification system as a means of managing and reporting problem and potential problem assets. BancPlus has incorporated an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with federal banking regulations, as part of its credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose BancPlus to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the categories mentioned above but possess weakness are required to be designated watch or special mention. Loans modified under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and related interagency guidance are excluded from being reported as troubled debt restructuring TDR loans.

 Total nonperforming assets decreased by 3.5 million, or 22.6 , from 15.3 million at December 31, 2021 to 11.8 million at December 31, 2022, primarily the result of sales of foreclosed assets and collections on TDR loans in the current year. This decrease in nonaccrual loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in corresponding decreases in the ratios for nonaccrual loans to total loans, nonperforming loans to total loans and nonperforming assets to total assets, as well as the increase in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans. 
 
 The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. BancPlus has established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (that is, place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized and is actively in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, current year interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income and prior year interest, if any, is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal.

 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. BancPlus maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management considers adequate to provide for known and probable incurred losses in the portfolio. The level of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of estimated losses in the portfolio, after consideration of risk characteristics of the loans and prevailing economic conditions. Loan charge-offs (i.e. loans judged to be uncollectible) are charged against the reserve and any subsequent recovery is credited to the reserve. BancPlus officers analyze risk in the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A risk system, consisting of multiple grading categories for each portfolio class, is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves. In addition to the risk system, management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower, past and expected loss experience, and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. These estimates are reviewed at least quarterly, and, as adjustments become necessary, they are recognized in the periods in which they become known. During 2022, the U.S. economy continued to experience volatility and there remains uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions as a result of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, the conflict in Ukraine, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Although management strives to maintain an allowance it deems adequate, future economic changes, deterioration of borrowers creditworthiness, and the impact of examinations by regulatory agencies all could cause changes to BancPlus allowance for loan losses. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses was 42.9 million and 45.0 million, and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.74 and 1.24 , at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Net charge-offs totaled 3.5 million and 68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The variance was primarily the result of current year charge-offs on commercial and industrial categories and higher recoveries in the prior year. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses decreased by 2.1 million, or 4.72 , to 42.9 million at December 31, 2022, from 45.0 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs in the current period.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 
 Goodwill was 62.8 million and 2.6 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired by the Company in prior acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to, at a minimum, an annual test for impairment. The increase in goodwill was the result of goodwill recognized related to the FTC Merger. Other intangible assets consisted of acquired customer relationships from a 2014 acquisition and core deposit intangibles from our mergers with SCC and FTC. Total other intangible assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 11.5 million and 5.1 million, respectively. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life.

 BancPlus relies on increasing its deposit base to fund loans and other asset growth. BancPlus competes for local deposits by offering a variety of products at competitive rates. The increase in total average deposits of 1.066 billion, or 24.0 , to 5.506 billion at December 31, 2022 compared with 4.440 billion at December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the FTC Merger. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, BancPlus held non-time deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits estimated at 1.527 billion and 889.3 million, respectively. 
 
 The following table shows the maturity of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2022:

 Borrowed Funds 
 
 Short-term Borrowings . In addition to deposits, BancPlus uses short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, to meet the daily liquidity needs of its customers and fund its loan growth. Federal funds purchased represent primarily overnight borrowings through relationships with correspondent banks. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are considered overnight borrowings and are secured by U.S. Government agency securities. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, BancPlus had no short-term borrowings. 
 
 Advances from FHLB and Other Borrowings . BankPlus is a member of the FHLB, and as a result, is eligible for advances from the FHLB pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements, which assist BancPlus in the funding of its loan and investment portfolios. BancPlus FHLB advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on first mortgage and other qualifying loans. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, BancPlus had 318.1 million and 20.5 million in FHLB borrowings, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.52 and 1.49 , respectively. 
 
 On February 25, 2022, the Company entered into a 20.0 million revolving line of credit with a correspondent bank. The line of credit is collateralized by 9,000 shares of BankPlus common stock. The line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of Wall Street Journal Prime with 3.25 interest rate floor. Interest only payments are due on a quarterly basis with the principal due at maturity on February 25, 2024. Unused fees on the revolving line of credit are paid quarterly at 0.25 . For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid unused fees of 24,000. The balance on this revolving line of credit was zero at December 31, 2022.

 Subordinated Debentures. On June 4, 2020, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.000 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 15, 2030 (the Notes ). The Company incurred issuance costs of 1.4 million in conjunction with the issuance of the Notes. These issuance costs are netted with the balance of the Notes on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized over the life of the Notes. The Notes will initially bear interest at a rate of 6.000 per annum from and including June 4, 2020, to but excluding June 15, 2025 or early redemption date, with interest during this period payable semiannually in arrears. From and including June 15, 2025, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the Three-Month Term SOFR plus 586 basis points, with interest during this period payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 captial. The Company used the proceeds from the Notes for general corporate purposes, including improving the Company s liquidity and capital position. 
 
 The Notes are not redeemable by the Company, in whole or in part, prior to the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, except that the Notes may be redeemed at any time in whole but not in part in the event of a Tier 2 Capital Event, a Tax Event, or an Investment Company Event, each as defined and described in the Notes. On or after the fifth anniversary of the original date of issue, the Notes will be redeemable on any interest payment date at the option of the Company, in whole or in part in integral multiples of 1,000, at an amount equal to 100 of the outstanding principal amount redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Any partial redemption will be made on a pro rata basis as to the holders of the Notes. Any redemption of the Notes is subject to any applicable regulatory requirements and approvals. 
 
 Effective March 1, 2022, in conjunction with the FTC Merger, the Company assumed FTC s obligations under its Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2020, and the several purchasers of the 21.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 issued thereunder (the FTC Subordinated Notes ). The FTC Subordinated Notes will mature on December 30, 2030 and bear interest at an initial fixed rate of 5.50 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including December 30, 2025, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to the Three-Month Term SOFR plus 527 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears. BancPlus will be entitled to redeem the FTC Subordinated Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after December 30, 2025, and to redeem the FTC Subordinated Notes in whole upon certain other events. The FTC Subordinated Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holder. The FTC Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of BancPlus only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any subsidiary of BancPlus. The FTC Subordinated Notes rank junior in right to payment to BancPlus current and future senior indebtedness. The FTC Subordinated Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. The FTC Subordinated Notes vary from the amount carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022 due to the remaining purchase premium of 583,000, which was established upon closing of the FTC Merger and is being amortized over the remaining life of the debentures. 
 
 BancPlus also owns the outstanding common stock of business trusts that have issued preferred capital securities to third parties. The preferred capital securities have qualified as Tier 1 capital, subject to regulatory rules and limits. These trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of the common stock and preferred capital securities to purchase subordinated debentures that BancPlus issued. The subordinated debentures are these trusts only assets, and quarterly interest payments on these subordinated debentures are the sole source of cash for these trusts to pay quarterly distributions on the common stock and preferred capital securities. BancPlus has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the trusts obligations on preferred capital securities. 
 
 The following table is a summary of debentures payable to statutory trusts:

 The subordinated debentures payable to statutory trusts vary from the amount carried on the consolidated balance sheet at due to the remaining purchase discount which was established upon the SCC Merger and is being amortized over the life of the debentures. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized purchase discount was 3.7 million and 4.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Interest rates adjust quarterly for the subordinated debentures with rates that are indexed with LIBOR. On March 15, 2022 the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act establishes a nationwide process for replacing LIBOR in financial contracts that mature after the cessation of the overnight, one-, three-, six- and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023 and that do not provide for an effective means to replace LIBOR upon its cessation. For contracts in which a party has the discretion to identify a replacement rate, the Act also provides a safe harbor to parties if they choose the SOFR-based benchmark replacement rate to be identified by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In January 2023, the Company was notified that the interest rate on the subordinated debentures would be replaced with SOFR. 
 
 The Company has the right to redeem the debentures prior to maturity. Upon redemption of the subordinated debentures payable to a statutory trust, the trust will also liquidate its common stock and preferred capital securities. 
 
 BancPlus believes that it will be able to meet its principal and interest payment obligations as they come due through maintenance of adequate cash levels or subsequent borrowings. BancPlus expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. BancPlus has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
 
 Shareholders Equity 
 
 Shareholders equity is influenced primarily by earnings, quarterly dividend payments, changes in common stock outstanding, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available for sale investment securities. 
 
 Shareholders equity increased 307.7 million, or 78.8 , to 698.1 million at December 31, 2022 from 390.4 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to the issuance of 250.0 million of preferred stock, net income of 60.8 million, and 56.5 million of equity issued in the FTC Merger, partially offset by other comprehensive loss of 43.0 million and dividends paid of 18.4 million for the year to date period. 
 
 On June 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (including annexes thereto, collectively, the Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury (the Treasury under the Emergency Capital Investment Program ECIP ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell 250,000 shares of the Company s preferred stock designated as Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series ECIP (the Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of 250.0 million in cash. The Preferred Stock was issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 
 The Preferred Stock bears no dividend for the first two years following the issuance of the Preferred Stock. Thereafter, the annual dividend rate will be adjusted, not lower than 0.5 and not higher than 2.0 , based on our extension of credit for qualified lending as defined in the terms of the ECIP Interim Final Rule, Purchase Agreement and the Certificate of Designations (the Certificate of Designations and the investment amount. After the tenth anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred Stock, the dividend rate will be fixed based on the average annual amount of lending in years 2 through 10 compared to the baseline qualified lending and the average investment amount. The dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15.

Table of Content s 

 The Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company on or after September 15, 2027 (or earlier in the event of loss of regulatory capital treatment), subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking regulator and in accordance with the federal banking agencies regulatory capital regulations. The restrictions on redemption are set forth in the Certificate of Designations filed with the Mississippi Secretary of State for the purpose of amending its Articles of Incorporation to fix the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of the Preferred Stock as described in Item 5.03 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 23, 2022. 
 
 In the Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed to, upon the future written request of the Treasury, comply with the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement included as an annex to the Purchase Agreement and incorporated by reference therein (the Registration Rights Agreement ), providing for certain registration rights of the Treasury. As long as the Company is not eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, upon written request of the Treasury, the Company would be required to prepare and file a shelf registration statement covering the potential resale of the Preferred Stock as promptly as practicable. Once the Company is eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, the Company has agreed to prepare and file such shelf registration statement within 30 days. The Registration Rights Agreement also includes customary piggyback registration rights, suspension rights, indemnification, contribution, and assignment provisions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Bank Liquidity Management 
 
 Liquidity is BancPlus capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost, having cash when BancPlus needs it and having the appropriate amount of cash and other assets that are quickly convertible into cash without incurring significant loss. BancPlus is expected to maintain adequate liquidity at BankPlus to meet the cash flow requirements of its customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on BancPlus ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting either BancPlus daily operations or its financial condition. BancPlus Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for managing commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving its financial objectives. ALCO meets regularly to review balance sheet composition, funding capacities, and current and forecasted loan demand, and BancPlus Treasury Management department continuously monitors its liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 
 
 BancPlus manages its liquidity by maintaining adequate levels of cash and other assets from on and off-balance sheet arrangements. Specifically, on-balance sheet liquidity consists of cash and due from banks and unpledged investment securities, which BancPlus considers its primary liquidity. Furthermore, a significant portion of these unencumbered liquid assets are comprised of U.S. government agency obligations, mortgage backed securities and other agency securities, which the regulatory bodies consider the most marketable and liquid, especially in a stress scenario. In regard to off-balance sheet capacity, BancPlus maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, as well as unsecured lines of credit for the purpose of overnight funds with various correspondent banks, which BancPlus consider its secondary liquidity. BancPlus also monitors its liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios, FHLB borrowings and deposits. As part of its liquidity management strategy, BancPlus is also focused on minimizing its costs of liquidity and attempting to decrease these costs by growing its noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits and replacing higher cost borrowed funds. 
 
 The following tables provide a summary of BancPlus primary and secondary liquidity levels.

 2,696,980 1,889,322 Ratio of primary and secondary liquidity to total deposits 52.1 58.7 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, BancPlus primary liquidity decreased by 486.5 million to 336.7 million, compared to 823.2 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to changes in cash and cash equivalents as a result of organic loan growth and a decrease in money market, negotiable orders of withdrawal, and savings deposits, partially offset by the increase in cash as a result of ECIP. Secondary liquidity increased by 807.7 million to 2.70 billion as of December 31, 2022 from 1.89 billion as of December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in BancPlus FHLB borrowing capacity due to the FTC Merger. 
 
 In addition to its primary liquidity, BancPlus generates liquidity from cash flows from its loan and securities portfolios and from its large base of core customer deposits, defined as total deposits less brokered deposits and time deposits greater than 250,000. Core deposits totaled 5.656 billion and 4.450 billion and represented 97.1 and 96.3 of total deposits as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products, which promote long-standing relationships and stable funding sources. Although BancPlus policy allows the use of brokered deposits, BankPlus did not utilize this funding source during the 2022 and 2021 year to date periods. 
 
 BancPlus liquidity policy includes both policy limits and policy guidelines for measuring and monitoring liquidity. BancPlus policy measures include an Internal Liquidity Ratio, an Internal Liquidity Ratio adjusted for FHLB, an Internal Dependency Ratio adjusted for FHLB and a Maximum Available Funds to Total Assets Ratio. These ratios are calculated monthly. BancPlus also utilizes eleven liquidity guidelines that are reported quarterly. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, BancPlus was in compliance with all of its established liquidity guidelines. 
 
 Holding Company Liquidity Management 
 
 BancPlus is a corporation separate and apart from BankPlus and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. BancPlus main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to it by BankPlus. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of BankPlus to pay dividends to the holding company. BancPlus believes that these limitations will not impact the ability of the holding company to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 
 Due to state banking laws, BankPlus may not pay dividends without the prior approval of the MDBCF. BankPlus received permission from the MDBCF to pay dividends of 25.2 million and 21.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to BancPlus. These dividends were used by the holding company to pay dividends to the BancPlus shareholders, principal and interest payments on debt and general operating expenses. 
 
 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
 BancPlus is subject to various capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on BancPlus business operations. 
 
 In 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies finalized a rule that simplifies capital requirements for qualifying community banks by providing an option to use a simple leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy and to not calculate risk-based capital ratios. A qualifying community bank has less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9 percent. The CBLR framework was effective on January 1, 2020, and the Company and the Bank elected to adopt the optional CBLR framework in the third quarter of 2022, as an alternative to the generally applicable capital rules. 
 
 Prior to their election to use the CBLR framework, BancPlus and BankPlus were subject to the generally applicable regulatory capital rules. These rules required BancPlus and BankPlus to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio.

Table of Content s 

In addition, prior to their election to use the CBLR framework, BancPlus and BankPlus were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 , consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, in addition to the risk-based minimum capital ratios, to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 
 
 Minimum capital requirements to which BankPlus and BancPlus are subject and were subject prior to their election to use the CBLR framework are summarized in the tables below. 
 
 Further, under prompt corrective action regulations, an insured depository institution is classified in one of several tiers based on its level of capital and other factors, and may be subject to an escalating series of remedial measures if it is less than well capitalized. An institution is deemed well capitalized if it satisfies certain capital ratios, summarized in the tables below, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, BancPlus and BankPlus met the minimum leverage ratio or capital adequacy requirements to which they are and were subject. As a bank holding company, BancPlus is not subject to the prompt corrective action regime that applies to insured depository institutions, including BankPlus. 
 
 BancPlus consolidated and BankPlus actual capital amounts and ratios are shown in the following tables as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

 and were comprised of 272.7 million of time deposits with maturity dates and 133.5 million of subordinated debentures with maturities ranging from 2034 through 2037. BancPlus expects to have adequate liquidity to meet these short and long-term obligations through profitability, repayments from loans and investment securities, deposit gathering activity and access to borrowing sources. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2022 consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 BancPlus consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the notes to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect its reported results and financial position for the current period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on BancPlus future financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The JOBS Act permits BancPlus an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. BancPlus has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will not be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies for the transition period for so long as BancPlus remains an emerging growth company or until BancPlus affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. 
 
 The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that BancPlus believes require BancPlus to make the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our 2022 consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 
 The allowance for loan losses, sometimes referred to as the allowance, is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management determines all or a portion of the loan balance to be uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for cash received on previously charged-off amounts. If the allowance is considered inadequate to absorb future loan losses on existing loans for any reason, including but not limited to, increases in the size of the loan portfolio, increases in charge-offs or changes in the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, the provision for loan losses is increased. 
 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that BancPlus will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. The collection of all amounts due according to contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. An impaired loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or, as a practical expedient, at the loan s observable market price, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of collateral, reduced by costs to sell on a discounted basis, is used if a loan is collateral dependent. 
 
 In situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, BancPlus grants a concession to the borrower that BancPlus would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. BancPlus measures any loss on the TDR in accordance with the guidance concerning impaired loans set forth above. Additionally, TDRs are generally placed on non-accrual status at the time of restructuring and included in impaired loans. These loans are returned to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates performance with the modified terms for a sustained period of time and has the capacity to continue to perform in accordance with the modified terms of the restructured debt. 
 
 Investment Securities Impairment 
 
 64 

Table of Content s 

 Periodically, BancPlus may need to assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In any such instance, BancPlus would consider many factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the market liquidity for the security, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and its intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the temporary loss. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value, with the write-down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains (losses). 
 
 The fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models, monitoring credit ratings and periodic reviews of key metrics. BancPlus evaluates the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. BancPlus procedures include initial and ongoing review of pricing methodologies and trends. BancPlus seeks to ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from its portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return market participants would require. As a result of this analysis, if BancPlus determines there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly. 
 
 Other Real Estate 
 
 Other real estate acquired through partial or total satisfaction of loans is initially carried at the fair value less cost to sell at the acquisition, establishing a new cost. Any loss incurred at the date of acquisition is charged to loan loss. Subsequent gains or loss on such assets and related operating income and expenses are reported in current operations when earned or incurred. 
 
 Income Tax Accounting 
 
 BancPlus uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available information indicates it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because BancPlus exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require BancPlus to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As a financial institution, BancPlus primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of economic loss due to changes in interest rates. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or loss of current fair market value. BancPlus continually seeks to measure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate risk also arises when BancPlus assets and liabilities each respond differently to changes in interest rates. 
 
 BancPlus management of interest rate risk is overseen by the ALCO. BancPlus risk management infrastructure approved by the BancPlus board of directors outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure establishes limits and management targets for various metrics, including net interest income at risk and economic value of equity at risk, given instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates. BancPlus risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as appropriate interest rate scenarios, loan prepayment rates, and transaction deposit durations. 
 
 BancPlus currently does not utilize derivative products to manage interest rate risk, although its policy does allow the use of derivatives within established parameters. BancPlus manages the interest rate risk associated with its interest bearing liabilities by managing the interest rates and terms associated with its borrowings and customer deposits on which BancPlus relies for funding. For instance, BancPlus occasionally uses special offers on deposits to attract additional balances and manage terms associated with its interest-bearing liabilities. BancPlus manages the interest rate risk associated with its earning assets by managing the interest rates and terms associated with its loan portfolio and investment securities portfolio.

 Net Interest Income Simulation and Economic Value Analysis 
 
 On a quarterly basis, BancPlus uses a model to simulate and measure potential changes in its net interest income and economic value of equity EVE given instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates. BancPlus net interest income at risk simulation measures shorter term risk over 12 and 24 month time frames. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value given the changes in interest rates. EVE is a point-in-time measurement that helps quantify longer term interest rate risk. The model has inherent limitations since the results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions as of a certain point in time. For purpose of the simulation, BancPlus assumes no balance sheet growth. Therefore, the model s results reflect an interest rate shock to a static balance sheet. 
 
 Potential changes to BancPlus net interest income and EVE in hypothetical rising and declining interest rate scenarios calculated as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the table below (dollars in thousands). The projections for December 31, 2022 assume immediate, parallel shifts down from the yield curves of 100, 200, and 300 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts up of 100, 200, and 300 basis points. The projections for December 31, 2021 assume immediate, parallel shifts down from the yield curves of 100 and 200 basis points and immediate, parallel shifts up of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 
 (Dollars in thousands) Change in Net Interest Income Change in Economic Value of Equity Parallel Rate Shift (basis points) 300 (907) (0.4) (28,909) (2.7) 200 (3,041) (1.2) (19,101) (1.8) 100 (2,090) (0.8) (9,706) (0.9) Unchanged -100 430 0.2 13,299 1.2 -200 (394) (0.2) 17,758 1.7 -300 (9,414) (3.7) 6,027 0.6 
 
 As of December 31, 2021 
 (Dollars in thousands) Change in Net Interest Income Change in Economic Value of Equity Parallel Rate Shift (basis points) 400 32,910 22.1 108,209 20.2 300 24,555 16.5 87,794 16.4 200 16,298 10.9 63,908 12.0 100 7,807 5.2 33,840 6.3 Unchanged -100 (2,945) (2.0) (64,207) (12.0) -200 (4,549) (3.1) (114,426) (21.4) 
 
 The table above indicates that in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, BancPlus would have experienced a 0.4 decrease in net interest income and a 2.7 decrease in EVE as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest, BancPlus would have experienced a 16.5 increase in net interest income and a 16.4 increase in EVE. In the event of an immediate 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, BancPlus would have experienced an increase of 0.2 in net interest income and a 1.2 increase in EVE as of December 31, 2022, and a 2.0 decrease in net interest income and a 12.0 decrease in EVE as of December 31, 2021. The changes in market risk exposures for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with year ended December 31, 2021 were the result of the historic increase in short term interest rates in 2022, increases in money market accounts and a shift out of overnight investments into loans in the current year. 
 
 The results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. The timing and magnitude of interest rate changes will most likely differ substantially from what is 
 66 

Table of Content s 

 depicted. The shape or steepness of the yield curve typically changes with each change in the Fed Funds target range. Increasing rates could reduce net interest income if BancPlus is required to increase deposit rates faster than planned to maintain volumes or its mix of assets and funding changes. Results could also change depending on faster or slower prepays in loans or early withdrawals in deposits than those assumed in the model. Finally, the results do not incorporate growth in the balance sheet or strategic changes made in response to changes in rates. 
 
 Because of the flaws in the nature of the static balance sheet rate shocks, ALCO also periodically runs model simulations that incorporate many of the factors mentioned above. These alternate scenarios change given the current economic environment, but may include the following: (1) expected balance sheet growth, (2) changes in rates timed with Federal Open Market Committee meetings, (3) increased early withdrawals of time deposits, (4) shifts in funding out of deposits and into wholesale borrowings, and (5) decreased growth of loans and deposits. Using a variety of scenarios in addition to BancPlus standard shocked scenarios enables ALCO to form a more accurate analysis of BancPlus overall interest rate sensitivity. 
 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 BancPlus consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of BancPlus assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on BancPlus performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services.

If a loan is impaired, a specific valuation allowance is allocated, if necessary, so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan s original interest rate, or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Groups of loans with similar risk characteristics, including individually evaluated loans not determined to be impaired, are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the group s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans.

 Accounting Standards Update 2022-02 ASU 2022-02 ), Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02 which eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and instead requires that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. ASU 2022-02 also enhances existing disclosure requirements and introduces new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For public business entities, these amendments require that an entity disclose current period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Gross write-off information must be included in the vintage disclosures required for public business entities in accordance with paragraph 326-20-50-6, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. ASU 2022-02 is effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 in the first quarter of 2023 did not materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Effect of Recently Issued, But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards 
 
 Accounting Standards Update 2020-04 ASU 2020-04 ), Reference Rate Reform - Topic 848. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP guidance on contract modifications, hedge accounting, and other transactions affected that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance and can be applied through December 31, 2022. The Company is still evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04, but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Accounting Standards Update 2022-06 ASU 2022-06 ), Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 which provides temporary relief during the transition period in complying with ASU 2020-04. The Board included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when LIBOR would cease being published. At the time that ASU 2020-04 was issued, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had established its intent that it would no longer be necessary to persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR after December 31, 2021. As a result, the sunset provision was set for December 31, 2022 - 12 months after the expected cessation date of all currencies and tenors of LIBOR. In March 2021, the FCA announced that the intended cessation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR would be June 30, 2023, which is beyond the current sunset date of Topic 848.

The put price is the appraised value of the stock. The fair value of shares of common stock held by the ESOP are deducted from permanent shareholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and reflected in a line item below liabilities and above shareholders equity. This presentation is necessary in order to recognize the put option within the ESOP-owned shares, consistent with SEC guidelines, that is present as long as the Company is not publicly traded. The Company uses a valuation by an external third-party to determine the maximum possible cash obligation related to these securities. Increases or decreases in the value of the cash obligation are included in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of changes of shareholders equity. The fair value of shares held by the ESOP at December 31, 2022 was million, based on the Company s previously disclosed appraised value of per share of common stock. The fair value of shares held by the ESOP at December 31, 2021 was million, based on the Company s previously disclosed appraised value of per share of common stock. As previously disclosed, these appraised values were determined solely for purposes of the ESOP s administration and are therefore subject to certain limitations, qualifications and assumptions and may not reflect the fair value of the Company s common stock and should not be relied on for any reason. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the trading markets for equity securities, including the value of equity securities of banking institutions.

 above the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. If, after deducting the buffer amount from its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, any of these amounts results in a risk-based capital ratio below the minimum, a banking institution subject to the generally applicable capital rules will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 
 Management believes as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company and the Bank met the minimum leverage ratio or capital requirements to which they are and were subject. 
 
 The Bank is also subject to capital requirements under the prompt corrective action regime. The prompt corrective action framework applies only to insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, and not to their holding companies, such as the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank maintained a leverage ratio of more than 9 and, as an institution that has elected to adopt the CBLR framework, the Bank was therefore categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2022 that management believes have changed the Bank s category. Prior to the adoption of the CBLR framework, including at December 31, 2021, the Bank was required to maintain certain ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets to be categorized as well capitalized. The amounts of the Bank s capital relative to the standards for well capitalized status for the relevant periods are set forth in the following table. 
 At December 31, 2021, the Company s and the Bank s CET1 capital includes total common equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. In connection with the adoption of Basel III, the Company elected to opt out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in CET1 capital. 
 Tier 1 capital includes CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. For the Company, additional Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2021 included million of trust preferred securities issued by the trusts (net of investment in the trusts). The Bank did not have any additional Tier 1 capital beyond CET1 capital as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 Total capital, which is used in the generally applicable capital rules but not CBLR, includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital for both the Company and the Bank includes a permissible portion of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2021 includes million of subordinated debentures. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 Generally accepted accounting principles require disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions significantly affect the estimates and, as such, the derived fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale and may not be comparable to that reported by other financial institutions. In addition, the fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates

 Corporate Governance Principles and Board Matters 
 
 Director Independence. Shares of BancPlus common stock are not listed on a national securities exchange or an inter-dealer quotation system that would require that a majority of BancPlus board of directors consist of independent directors. Under these circumstances, the rules of the SEC require that BancPlus identify which of its directors is independent using a definition for independence for directors of a national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, which has a requirement that a majority of the board of directors be independent. The BancPlus board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director based upon the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, including applicable independence requirements for committees of the board of directors. Applying these standards, the BancPlus board of directors has affirmatively determined that, with the exception of Messrs. Peaster, W. Ray, Webb, Yates, Leake, and Graves, each of BancPlus directors qualifies as an independent director under the applicable rules. With the exception of Mr. Leake, who serves on BancPlus Compensation Committee, BancPlus Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are comprised entirely of independent directors. Mr. Leake is not currently an executive officer or family member of an executive officer, and the board of directors has determined that his committee membership is in the best interest of BancPlus and its shareholders. 
 
 In making independence determinations, the BancPlus board of directors has considered the current and prior relationships that each director has with BancPlus and all other facts and circumstances the BancPlus board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of BancPlus capital stock by each director, and the transactions involving them described in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation . Mr. Leake, a member of BancPlus Compensation Committee, is affiliated with Ross Yerger, an insurance agency that provides insurance to BancPlus and to BankPlus. For additional information, see Item 13. Certain Relations and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Other Related Person Transactions. None of the BancPlus executive officers serves or has served as a member of the board of directors, compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as one of the BancPlus directors or on the Compensation Committee.

 BancPlus Executive Compensation Program 
 
 The BancPlus Compensation Committee and the board of directors oversees BancPlus executive compensation program, which includes both annual and long-term performance-based incentive programs that BancPlus believes are market-competitive and linked to the strategic objectives of BancPlus. In developing the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the advice and recommendation of its compensation consultant. 
 
 Annual Incentive Program 
 
 Under BancPlus annual incentive program AIP ), each executive officer has a target annual award amount based on a multiple of his or her base salary. The executive officers are eligible to earn the annual award in cash based on BankPlus performance relative to metrics that are aligned with the strategic objectives of BancPlus, as established by the Compensation Committee from year to year. Annual awards for threshold performance start at 50 of the target amount, with maximum performance earning 150 of the target amount. Performance below the threshold level results in no payout for that metric. 
 
 For 2022, Mr. Ray s target AIP award was 50 of his base salary and each of Mr. Webb and Mr. Graves target AIP award was 40 of his respective base salary. The 2022 AIP awards were based on four corporate performance metrics of various weights: adjusted net operating income, weighted 35 ; ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets, weighted 25 ; adjusted efficiency ratio, weighted 20 ; and loan growth, weighted 20 , with each metric having a defined threshold, target, and maximum performance goal. In February 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that BancPlus had reached maximum performance level on the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets and loan growth metrics. BancPlus achieved 132.9 on the net operating income metric and 144.3 on the adjusted efficiency ratio metric. Therefore Mr. Ray, Mr. Webb and Mr. Graves each received 142.9 of the maximum 150 target award under the AIP. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Program 
 
 Under BancPlus long-term incentive program LTIP ), BancPlus executive officers are eligible to receive equity-based awards under the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan ). Each executive officer has a target LTIP award value based on a multiple of his or her base salary and is eligible to receive an LTIP award based on BancPlus performance relative to a performance metric or metrics determined by the Compensation Committee. LTIP awards for threshold performance start at 50 of target value, with maximum performance resulting in an award determined using 150 of the target value. No grant is made for results falling below threshold performance. For 2022, LTIP awards were based on return on equity and the Compensation Committee determined that BancPlus achieved maximum performance.

 Ray Employment Agreement 
 
 BancPlus entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ray (the Ray Employment Agreement effective January 1, 2018, amended as of August 1, 2022, and most recently amended as of September 20, 2022. The term of the Ray Employment Agreement expires on December 31, 2023, unless renewed or there is a change in control (as defined in the Ray Employment Agreement), in which case the term is extended until the 24-month anniversary of the change in control. The Ray Employment Agreement generally provides that Mr. Ray will (a) receive an annual base salary (subject to annual adjustments), (b) be eligible to participate in the AIP and the LTIP on the same basis generally applicable to senior executive officers, (c) participate in BancPlus qualified retirement plan, employee benefit and deferred compensation programs, perquisite programs (including the provision of a Company automobile and/or mileage reimbursement for business travel, among other perquisite benefits) and any health benefit plans available to senior executive officers, (d) receive continued coverage under a life insurance policy providing a death benefit of no less than 2,560,000, and (e) receive reimbursement of country club dues and assessments. The Ray Employment Agreement provides for the following severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by BancPlus other than for cause or by Mr. Ray for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Ray Employment Agreement), unrelated to a change in control (as such term is defined in the Ray Employment Agreement): (a) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of three times his then-current base salary and two times the average bonus received by Mr. Ray in the prior three years, (b) payment of a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on achievement of the applicable performance metrics, and (c) payment of COBRA premiums for 18 months. The Ray Employment Agreement also provides that if the Company fails to renew or extend the Ray Employment Agreement for calendar year 2024, Mr. Ray will receive, as severance, a lump sum payment equal to two times his then-current base salary plus any bonus for 2023 normally paid in 2024, as well as the title of the vehicle Mr. Ray drives. As a condition of his receipt of these severance benefits, Mr. Ray must sign a general release in favor of BancPlus and comply with certain restrictive covenants, including covenants not to disclose confidential information, not to compete for six months following termination, and not to solicit employees or customers or interfere with any of BancPlus customer relationships for 36 months following termination. The Ray Employment Agreement also contains certain additional change in control protections, described below. 
 
 Change in Control Agreements 
 
 The occurrence or potential occurrence of a change in control could create uncertainty regarding the continued employment of BancPlus executive officers. Change in control protections offer executive officers a level of security that BancPlus believes allows them to continue to focus and serve in the best interest of BancPlus and BancPlus shareholders. 
 
 The Ray Employment Agreement contains certain provisions that provide severance benefits to Mr. Ray in the event of a qualifying termination of employment related to a change in control. BancPlus entered into a Change in Control Agreement effective January 1, 2018 with Mr. Webb (the Webb CIC Agreement ), which had an initial two-year term and automatically renews January 1 of each year for successive one-year terms unless either party notifies the other of an intent not to renew no later

Each of the Ray Employment Agreement, Webb CIC Agreement and Graves CIC Agreement provide for severance benefits described below in the event of a termination of employment by BancPlus other than for cause or by the executive for good reason during a defined protected period related to a change in control. 
 
 For Mr. Ray, if his employment is terminated by BancPlus other than for cause or by him for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Ray Employment Agreement) during the period beginning six months before and ending 24 months following a change in control (as such term is defined in the Ray Employment Agreement), he will receive the following severance benefits: (a) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of three times his then-current base salary and three times the average annual bonus received by Mr. Ray in the prior three years, (b) payment of a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on achievement of the applicable performance metrics, (c) continued health plan coverage until he is covered under another plan or Medicare Part B, (d) payment of life insurance premiums for ten years, (e) reimbursement of country club dues and assessments for two years, and (f) transfer of his automobile lease and reimbursement of lease payments for remainder of lease term. 
 
 For Mr. Webb and Mr. Graves, if either executive s employment is terminated by BancPlus other than for cause or by such executive for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Webb CIC Agreement and the Graves CIC Agreement, respectively) during the period beginning six months before and ending 12 months following a change in control (as such term is defined in the Webb CIC Agreement and the Graves CIC Agreement, respectively), such executive will receive the following severance benefits: (a) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of two times his then-current base salary and two times the average annual bonus received for the prior three years, (b) payment of a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination based on achievement of the applicable performance metrics, and (c) payment of an amount equal to the employer portion of health care costs for up to 12 months. 
 
 Under each of the Ray Employment Agreement, Webb CIC Agreement and Graves CIC Agreement, if any part of the severance payments or benefits received by any of BancPlus named executive officers in connection with a termination related to a change in control constitutes an excess parachute payment under Section 4999 of the Code, the executive will receive the greater of (1) the amount of such payments and benefits reduced so that none of the amount constitutes an excess parachute payment, net of income taxes, or (2) the full amount of such payments and benefits, net of all applicable taxes, including income taxes, employment taxes and excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. The Ray Employment Agreement further provides that, if the Company is not publicly traded and the shareholder vote exemption under Section 280G of the Code is available, if Mr. Ray waives his rights to receive excess parachutes, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder vote. In addition, each of the Ray Employment Agreement, Webb CIC Agreement and Graves CIC Agreement require as a condition of receipt of these change in control severance benefits that the executive sign a general release in favor of BancPlus and comply with certain restrictive covenants, including covenants not to disclose confidential information, not to compete for six months following termination, and not to solicit employees or customers or interfere with any of BancPlus customer relationships for 36 months following termination, in the case of Mr. Ray, and 24 months, in the case of Mr. Webb or Mr. Graves.

The limitations on the number of shares of BancPlus common stock under the 2018 Plan are subject to adjustment for specified changes in capitalization, including a stock split, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares, exchange for other securities, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation or any other increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares of BancPlus common stock effected without consideration to the Company. As of December 31, 2022, 445,888 shares of BancPlus common stock were available for issuance under the 2018 Plan, and there were 184,284 outstanding restricted stock grants that remained subject to forfeiture. 
 
 Amendment or Termination . The BancPlus board of directors may amend, modify or terminate the 2018 Plan at any time, except that, without shareholder approval, the BancPlus board of directors may not increase the maximum number of shares of BancPlus common stock that may be issued under the 2018 Plan, materially expand the classes of individuals eligible to receive awards under the 2018 Plan, materially expand the types of awards available for issuance under the 2018 Plan or make other changes requiring shareholder approval under applicable law or listing agency rule. The termination or any modification or amendment of the 2018 Plan will not, without the consent of a participant, adversely affect the participant s right under an award previously granted. 
 
 Description of Awards and Tax Implications . The following is a brief summary of the types of awards issuable under the 2018 Plan and the principal United States federal income tax consequences of those awards. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, does not constitute tax advice and, among other things, does not describe state, local or foreign tax consequences, which may be substantially different, or the deferred compensation provisions of Section 409A of the Code to the extent that an award is subject to and does not satisfy the rules. 
 
 Stock Options . Stock options provide the holder with the right to purchase shares of BancPlus common stock at a future date at a specified exercise price and may be issuable as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Incentive stock options generally provide the holders with certain favorable tax benefits, as compared to non-qualified stock options. The terms of each option award, including any vesting requirements, are determined by or under the direction of the Committee at the time of grant, subject to certain limitations under the 2018 Plan or applicable law. Accordingly, the 2018 Plan requires that the exercise price of a stock option be at least equal to the fair market value of BancPlus common stock on the date that the option is granted, and the term of any incentive stock option may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. Further, no incentive stock option may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the plan. In the event of termination of employment of a participant, any vested incentive stock option that is outstanding and held by that participant will expire and terminate unless exercised within three months of the termination event, unless as a result of death or disability, for which longer exercise periods are permitted. Certain additional limitations would apply with respect to any incentive stock option issued to an employee who also beneficially owns 10 or more of BancPlus common stock. 
 
 In general, a participant realizes no taxable income upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. The exercise of an incentive stock option, however, may result in an alternative minimum tax liability to the participant. With certain exceptions, a disposition of shares purchased under an incentive stock option within two years from the date of grant or within one year after exercise produces ordinary income to the participant (and a deduction for us) equal to the value of the shares at the time of exercise less the exercise price. Any additional gain recognized in the disposition is treated as a capital gain for which BancPlus is not entitled to a deduction. If the participant does not dispose of the shares until after the expiration of these one- and two-year holding periods, any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale is treated as a long-term capital gain or loss for which BancPlus is not entitled to a deduction. 
 
 A participant generally will not recognize taxable income on the grant of a non-qualified stock option. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the BancPlus common stock received on the date of exercise and the option cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the exercise price per share). The participant will generally recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of the option even 
 129 

Table of Contents 

 though the shares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale or transferability. BancPlus will generally be entitled to a deduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise. Upon a subsequent sale of shares acquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be taxable as a capital gain or loss. 
 
 Stock Appreciation Rights . Stock appreciation rights provide the recipient with the right to receive from BancPlus the excess, if any, of the fair market value of one share of BancPlus common stock on the date of exercise, over the exercise price of the stock appreciation right. Under the 2018 Plan, the exercise price of a stock appreciation right may not be less than the fair market value of BancPlus common stock on the grant date. When exercised, stock appreciation rights may generally be paid by BancPlus in cash or shares of BancPlus common stock. Any grant of stock appreciation rights may specify performance measures that must be achieved as a condition to exercising such rights, waiting periods before stock appreciation rights become exercisable and permissible dates or periods on or during which such awards are exercisable. 
 
 A participant will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of a stock appreciation right, but will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right in an amount equal to the cash amount received upon exercise (if the stock appreciation right is cash-settled) or the fair market value of the BancPlus common stock received upon exercise (if the stock appreciation right is stock-settled). BancPlus will generally be entitled to a deduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise. 
 
 Restricted Stock . A grant of restricted stock constitutes a transfer of ownership of the shares of BancPlus common stock to the recipient, subject to certain restrictions determined by the Committee that will lapse upon the satisfaction of those conditions and restrictions. During the restricted period, the holder will not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares, except for any dividend or voting rights contained in the award agreement. Upon the satisfaction of those conditions and restrictions, the shares will become freely transferable by the recipient. Any grant of restricted stock may specify performance measures which, if achieved, will result in termination or early termination of the restrictions applicable to such shares. 
 
 A participant generally will not be taxed at the time of a restricted stock award but will recognize taxable income when the award vests or otherwise is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The amount of taxable income will be the fair market value of the shares at that time, less any amount paid for the shares. Participants may elect to be taxed at the time of grant on the fair market value of the shares included in the award by making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days of the award date. If a restricted stock award subject to the Section 83(b) election is subsequently forfeited, no deduction or tax refund will be allowed for the amount previously recognized as income. Unless a participant makes a Section 83(b) election, any dividends paid to a participant on shares of an unvested restricted stock award will be taxable to the participant as ordinary income. If the participant makes a Section 83(b) election, any dividends will be taxable to the participant as dividend income. BancPlus will generally be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the ordinary income recognized by the participant. Unless a participant has made a Section 83(b) election, BancPlus will also be entitled to a deduction, for federal income tax purposes, for dividends paid on unvested restricted stock awards. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units . A grant of restricted stock units constitutes an agreement by BancPlus to deliver shares of BancPlus common stock or the cash value thereof to the recipient in the future upon the completion of service or performance conditions, or other terms and conditions specified in the award agreement. During the applicable restriction period, the recipient will have no rights of ownership in any shares of BancPlus common stock deliverable upon payment of the restricted stock units. 
 
 A participant does not recognize income, and BancPlus will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a restricted stock unit is granted. When the restricted stock units vest and are settled for cash or stock, the participant generally will be required to recognize as income an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of vesting, and BancPlus will generally be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the ordinary income recognized by the participant. Any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the stock (if settled in stock) is treated as capital gain or loss for which BancPlus is not entitled to a deduction. 
 
 Other Awards . The 2018 Plan also provides for certain other awards, including dividend equivalent rights and performance units. A dividend equivalent right entitles a participant to payments in an amount determined by reference to any cash dividends paid on a specified number of shares of BancPlus common stock to shareholders of record during such period as will be determined by the Committee, and are subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee, in its discretion, will determine. Payment in respect of a dividend equivalent right may be made in cash or shares of BancPlus common stock. A performance unit award grants a participant the right to receive, at a specified time, payment of an amount equal to all or a portion of the value of a specified or determinable number of units (stated in terms of a designated or determinable dollar amount per unit) subject to the attainment of the performance goals and other conditions established in the discretion of the Committee. Payment in respect of a performance unit award may be made in cash or shares of BancPlus common stock. With respect to each of these types of awards, when the participant receives payment with respect to the award, the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any shares of 
 130 

Table of Contents 

 BancPlus common stock received will be ordinary income to the participant, and BancPlus will generally be entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount. 
 
 Withholding . BancPlus will deduct or withhold, or require the participant to remit to us, an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local and foreign taxes required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of a transaction under the 2018 Plan. 
 
 Certain Limitations on Deductibility of Executive Compensation . With certain exceptions, Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deduction to publicly-traded companies for compensation paid to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers whose compensation is reportable under the Exchange Act, to 1 million per executive per taxable year. In addition, awards that are granted, accelerated, or enhanced in connection with a change in control or a termination of employment as a result of a change in control may give rise to excess parachute payments (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), which payments are subject to a 20 excise tax imposed on the participant. BancPlus would generally not be able to deduct the excess parachute payments made to a participant. 
 
 BancPlus Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 
 BancPlus maintains an employee stock ownership plan (the ESOP that covers all employees who are 21 years of age or older and work in a position requiring at least 1,000 hours of service annually. The ESOP also has 401(k) provisions that allow for employee tax deferred contributions. Participants may make contributions to the ESOP in accordance with applicable regulations and the ESOP s provisions. BancPlus makes a 3 safe harbor matching contribution, plus an additional matching contribution equal to 50 of the next 2 of an employee s salary deferral contributions in excess of 3 . Additional contributions are made to the ESOP at the discretion of the BancPlus board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, the ESOP owned 1,452,950 shares of BancPlus common stock. 
 
 Director Compensation 
 
 BancPlus non-management directors receive an annual retainer and a monthly attendance fee of 1,200 provided they attend the regular monthly board of directors meeting. In addition, they receive committee chair and member cash retainers for their service on board of directors committees. Finally, BancPlus non-management directors also receive an annual grant of BancPlus restricted stock with a grant date value of 25,000. Directors who are also employees do not receive the cash retainers or the restricted stock grant, but are eligible to receive the monthly meeting attendance fee. Directors have been and will continue to be reimbursed for travel, food, lodging and other expenses directly related to their activities as directors. The cash retainers payable under BancPlus director compensation program are summarized in the table below.

 In addition to the above, the chairman of the board of directors receives an annual retainer of 70,000, the lead director receives an annual retainer of 15,000, and non-management directors who are members of the executive committee receive an annual retainer of 10,000. In 2015, the BancPlus board of directors implemented a director retirement program providing that any director elected in March 2015 who retires from the board of directors at a future date after attaining the age of 75 will be paid a monthly fee of 1,800 (for an annual amount of 21,600) for the remainder of the director s life.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 
 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
 
 In addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described in Executive Compensation above, the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2022, and each proposed transaction, in which: 
 
 BancPlus has been or will be a participant; 
 the amount involved exceeds or will exceed 120,000; and 
 any of BancPlus directors, nominees for director, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than five percent of BancPlus capital stock, or any immediate family member of or person sharing the household with any of these individuals (other than tenants or employees), had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
 
 Ordinary Banking Relationships 
 
 Certain of the BancPlus officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are customers of, or have or have had transactions with, BankPlus, BancPlus or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include deposits, loans and other financial services related transactions. Related party transactions are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral (where applicable), as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to BancPlus, do not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to BancPlus and are a type that BankPlus generally makes available to the public. As of the date of this prospectus, no related party loans were categorized as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problem loans. BancPlus expects to continue to enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business on similar terms with its officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates. 
 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits a public company from extending or renewing credit or arranging the extension or renewal of credit to an executive officer or director. However, this prohibition does not apply to loans made by depository institutions such as BankPlus that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are compliant with federal banking regulations. Accordingly, BancPlus permits its directors and executive officers, their family members and their related interests, to establish and maintain banking and business relationships with BankPlus as long as such relationships are in the ordinary course of business and in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. With respect to lending activities, BankPlus has policies governing affiliate and insider lending transactions. These policies prohibit extensions of credit to insiders, as defined in the policies, including BancPlus executive officers and directors, unless the extension of credit: 
 
 is made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as, and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with members of the general public; 
 135 

Table of Contents 

 does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 
 is of a type that is generally made available by BankPlus to the public. 
 
 Other Related Person Transactions 
 
 BancPlus retains Ross Yerger, an insurance agency, to provide insurance to BancPlus and to BankPlus. In the fiscal year 2022, BancPlus paid approximately 2.0 million to Ross Yerger for these policies. Since January 1, 2023, BancPlus has paid less than 1,000 to Ross Yerger for its current policies.

Since January 1, 2023, Mr. Leake has received 4,000 in commissions from Ross Yerger in connection with transactions with BancPlus and BankPlus.

Since January 1, 2023, Ross Yerger has paid 11,000 to Mr. Leake in connection with BancPlus-related third-party referrals. 
 
 Policies and Procedures Regarding Related Party Transactions 
 
 The BancPlus board of directors has adopted a written related party transaction approval policy (the RPT Policy pursuant to which an independent committee of the BancPlus board of directors, the Audit Committee, reviews and approves or takes such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to the following transactions: 
 
 any transaction in which BancPlus is a participant, or any agreement or amendment to an agreement to which BancPlus is a party, and which involves an amount exceeding 120,000 and in which any of the BancPlus directors, executive officers or 5 shareholders, or any other related person as defined in Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K Item 404 ), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest; and 
 any other transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404. 
 
 The RPT Policy sets forth factors to be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to approve any such transaction, including the nature of BancPlus involvement in the transaction, whether BancPlus has demonstrable business reasons to enter into the transaction, whether the transaction would impair the independence of a director and whether the proposed transaction involves any potential reputational or other risks. 
 
 To simplify the administration of the approval process under the RPT Policy, the Audit Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for approval of certain types of related party transactions or designate certain types of such transactions that will be deemed pre-approved. The RPT Policy also provides that the following transactions are deemed pre-approved: 
 
 decisions on compensation or benefits or the hiring or retention of BancPlus directors or executive officers, if approved by the applicable committee of the BancPlus board of directors; 
 the indemnification and advancement of expenses pursuant to the BancPlus articles of incorporation, the BancPlus bylaws or an indemnification agreement; and 
 transactions where the related person s interest or benefit arises solely from such person s ownership of BancPlus securities and holders of such securities receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.

At a meeting of the Board of Directors, any individual director may be suspended from office for failure to qualify by vote of a simple majority of the Board of Directors.

Upon such written determination containing a statement constituting grounds therefor by the Board as described under (1) above, the director subject to the determination shall be immediately suspended provided, however, such director may request, and shall be so granted, the right to a special shareholders' meeting to vote upon the suspension in light of the matter in question and during the pendency of the shareholders' meeting, shall be suspended and prohibited from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the corporation pending the outcome of the shareholders' vote. Upon the filing of charges as described under (2) above, such director shall be suspended and prohibited from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the corporation. Such suspension shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of and not subject to further appellate review.

 Exhibit 14.1 

CODE OF ETHICS POLICY 
 March 15, 2022 
 
 Our Bank's reputation of honesty, integrity and security is no greater than the personal reputations of our individual staff members. To protect this reputation and to assure uniformity in standards of conduct, the Bank must re-affirm and clarify its basic policy concerning conduct of Bank officials 
 
 1. Employees, officers, directors, agents or attorneys Bank officials of the Bank shall not solicit for themselves or for a third party (other than the Bank itself) anything of value from anyone in return for any business, service or confidential information of the Bank. 
 
 2. Bank officials should not accept anything of value (other than bona fide salary, wages and fees referred to in 18 US. C. 215) from anyone in connection with the business of the Bank, either before or after a transaction is discussed or consummated. 
 
 3. The following are exceptions to the general prohibition regarding acceptance of things of value in connection with bank business 
 
 (a) if acceptance is based on a family or personal relationship existing independent of any business of the institution, provided the value is reasonable under the circumstances 
 
 (b) if the benefit is available to the general public under the same conditions in which it is available to the Bank official 
 
 (c) if the benefit is reasonable under the circumstances and would be paid for by the Bank as a reasonable business expense if not paid for by another party 
 
 (d) if the benefit accepted is advertising or promotional material of reasonable value 
 
 (e) loans from other financial institutions on terms available to other similarly situated customers to finance proper and usual activities of Bank officials 
 
 (f) receipt of civic, charitable, educational, or religious organization awards for recognition of service and accomplishment so long as the award is not of substantial value or lavish and 
 
 (g) gifts of reasonable value that are related to commonly recognized events or occasions, such as promotions, new job, wedding, retirement, holiday or birthday. 

Exhibit 14.1 

 4. The Bank may, on a case by case basis, approve other circumstances, not identified above, in which a Bank official may accept something of value in connection with Bank business. Such approvals must be in writing after full disclosure of all relevant facts so long as the approval is consistent with the bank bribery statute. 
 
 5. If a Bank official is offered or receives something of value from a customer or a vendor beyond what is authorized in the Bank's Code of Ethics Policy or if the value thereof exceeds 250, the Bank official must disclose that fact in writing to the Human Resource Committee. 
 
 6. A confidential relationship between the Bank and each of its customers must be maintained at all times. This is a fundamental principle of the banking business. Confidential information, such as account balances, anticipated changes in management or financial condition of customers, must be held inviolate by those to whom it is entrusted and must never be discussed outside the normal and necessary course of bank business. Moreover, Bank officials must never make changes in their personal investment portfolios on the basis of such confidential information. 
 
 7. Full disclosure must be made in writing to the Chief Human Resources Officer of any ownership interest in any entity that is contemplating or is engaged in a contractual relationship with BankPlus. 
 
 8. Bank officials must never become a director or any official of a competing bank without first requesting specific approval by submitting your request to the Human Resource Committee. This becomes increasingly important as the Bank grows since many conflicting competitive interests may be involved. 
 
 9. Bank officials are prohibited from self-dealing or otherwise trading on their positions with the Bank or accepting from anyone doing or seeking to do business with the Bank a business opportunity not available to other persons or that is made available because of such official's position with the Bank. 
 
 10. Bank officials are free to invest in stocks and other securities at their discretion, but speculation, excessive borrowing or gambling are inconsistent with a Bank official's position and are prohibited. 
 
 11. Employees may not profit personally, directly or indirectly, as a result of knowledge about a security or other transaction that is non-public information they may become aware of in the course of working at BankPlus. Non-public information is information that has not been disseminated in a manner that would make it generally available to the public. Non-public information derived from working at the Bank must not be disclosed to anyone outside the organization or inside the organization without a need to know.
