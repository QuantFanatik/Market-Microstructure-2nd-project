Imperial undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained herein, except as required by applicable law. 
 Forward-looking and other statements regarding Imperial's environmental, social and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or requiring disclosure in the company's filings with securities regulators. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making. 
 Energy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply Imperial views any particular scenario as likely to occur. In addition, energy demand scenarios require assumptions on a variety of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes its Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 scenario as extremely challenging, requiring unprecedented innovation, unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not Imperial, and their use by Imperial is not an endorsement by the company of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of Imperial s separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by Imperial of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization. 
 The term project as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

 Disclosure of reserves 
 Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end 
 The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2022, as detailed in the Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities part of the Financial section , starting on page 41 of this report. 
 All of the company s reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2022 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

 The estimation of proved reserve volumes, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures, and development and production costs, and other factors. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the company s capital spending and also impact its partners capacity to fund their share of joint projects. 
 Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 
 Imperial s proved reserves in 2022 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 
 Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages. 
 In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 

6 

Preparation of reserves estimates 
 Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperial s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official reserves estimates for Imperial s proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 
 The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the company s official reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors. 
 The internal qualified reserves evaluator is a professional geoscientist registered in Alberta, Canada and has 20 years of petroleum industry experience, including 11 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The company s internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 20 persons with an average of 14 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 18 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The company s internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 15 persons with an average of 11 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves. 
 
 Proved undeveloped reserves 
 As at December 31, 2022, approximately 11 percent of the company s proved reserves were proved undeveloped reflecting volumes of 240 million oil-equivalent barrels. Proved undeveloped reserves are associated with Syncrude and Cold Lake. This compared to 386 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2021. The decrease of 146 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves includes a decrease of 133 million oil-equivalent barrels at Cold Lake associated with a shift of future development from the traditional Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) to lower emissions intensity, solvent based technologies, a decrease of 7 million oil-equivalent barrels at Syncrude, and a decrease of 6 million oil-equivalent barrels due to the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets sale. No proved undeveloped reserves were converted into proved developed reserves during 2022. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more represent about 6 percent (14 million oil-equivalent barrels) of proved undeveloped reserves and are associated with ongoing development programs at Cold Lake. These undeveloped reserves are planned to be developed in a staged approach to align with operational capacity and efficient capital spending commitment over the life of the asset. The company is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. 
 One of the company s requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about 167 million during the year to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves at Cold Lake and Syncrude. These investments represented about 15 percent of the 1,128 million in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 
 Cold Lake 
 To maintain production at Cold Lake, capital expenditures for additional production wells and associated facilities are required periodically. In 2022, additional wells were drilled on existing phases. In 2023, an infill development drilling program is planned within the approved development area to add productive capacity. Additionally, in 2022, the company approved the budget for the Leming steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) project that will re-develop the original pilot area of the Cold Lake field, with development activities to commence in 2023 and start-up planned in 2024. 
 The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production or recovery techniques. 
 Aspen, Cold Lake expansion and other oil sands activities 
 In October 2018, the company received regulatory approval for the Aspen solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) project from the Alberta Energy Regulator. Development was proposed to occur in two phases, each producing about 75,000 barrels per day, before royalties. The first phase of the project was approved by the company s board, and appropriated for 2.6 billion. Construction began late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In March 2019, the company slowed the pace of development given market uncertainty stemming from the Government of Alberta s temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations and other industry competitiveness challenges. Although the Government of Alberta repealed the regulatory authority for imposing temporary production curtailments at the end of 2021, major investment remains on hold. Aspen s project pace will continue to be evaluated and remains an important opportunity for Imperial. 

10 

In August 2018, Imperial received regulatory approval from the Alberta Energy Regulator for an expansion project at Cold Lake to develop the Grand Rapids interval using SA-SAGD technology, capable of producing 50,000 barrels per day before royalties. Imperial intends to develop the Grand Rapids reservoir through capital-efficient investments that make use of available steam capacity from existing plants, with the initial phase of Grand Rapids development planned as an extension from the Nabiye plant. In April 2022, the Grand Rapids Phase 1 (GRP1) project was approved by the company's board with a forecasted average production of 15,000 barrels per day before royalties. Development activities are planned to be completed by year-end 2023. 
 Work progresses on technical and technology evaluations to support potential Clarke Creek, Corner, Clyden and Chard in-situ development regulatory applications. 
 The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 
 Montney and Duvernay 
 The company owned a 50 percent interest in XTO Energy Canada, which included Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets located in central Alberta. On August 31, 2022, jointly with ExxonMobil Canada, Imperial sold its interests in XTO Energy Canada to Whitecap Resources Inc. The sale completed the marketing effort announced in January 2022, and is consistent with Imperial s strategy to focus upstream resources on key oil sands assets and its commitment to deliver long-term value to shareholders. The assets included 567,000 net acres in the Montney shale, 72,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta. Net production from these assets was about 140 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and about 9,000 barrels of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids per day. 
 
 The sale of the assets followed the company's ramp down of drilling activity and adjustment of long-term development plans in 2020 and 2021. 
 Beaufort Sea 
 The company holds a 25 percent interest in two exploration licences in the Beaufort Sea. In 2016, the Federal Government of Canada declared Arctic waters off limits to new offshore oil and gas licences for five years subject to review at the end of that period. Existing licences were not impacted. In June 2019, the Federal Government approved selective changes to the Canada Petroleum Resources Act to prohibit and freeze the existing licences through the completion of the Beaufort Regional Strategic Environmental Assessment (BR-SEA) review. In 2022, the prohibition was extended to December 31, 2023 with a second one-year extension. During this time, the Federal Government plans to finalize the BR-SEA for public release which will be subject to a stakeholder review period that will aim to address regional social, environmental, economic and spill response impacts of natural resource development in the Arctic. The company continues to hold the licences while maintaining community engagement and participation in the BR-SEA process. 
 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 
 The company continues to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region.

Present activities 
 Review of principal ongoing activities 
 Kearl 
 Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 
 During 2022, the company s share of Kearl s net bitumen production was about 157,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 172,000 barrels per day. 
 Total gross production for Kearl was about 242,000 barrels per day (172,000 barrels Imperial s share), down 21,000 barrels per day (14,000 barrels Imperial's share) compared to 2021, as a result of extreme cold weather impacts in the first quarter of 2022. 
 In 2022, the company successfully completed the startup of the second Boiler Flue Gas Unit, incorporating learnings from the first unit's startup in 2021. This technology recovers waste heat from a boiler s combustion exhaust to pre-heat process water. Each unit has the potential to reduce operating costs and emissions. Imperial is currently progressing plans to apply this innovative technology on up to four additional boilers by year-end 2023. 
 Cold Lake 
 Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 During 2022, net bitumen production at Cold Lake was about 106,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 144,000 barrels per day. Gross production increased about 4,000 barrels per day compared to 2021 as a result of improved reliability, production optimizations, and recent capital-efficient infill drilling. 
 Cold Lake has expanded its commercial application of Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery (LASER), with the technology now being applied to approximately 10 per cent of production, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional CSS technology. 
 Syncrude 
 Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is typically shipped to the company s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 In 2022, the company s share of Syncrude s net production was about 63,000 barrels per day. The gross production was about 77,000 barrels per day, which is an increase of about 6,000 barrels per day compared to 2021, supported by the interconnect pipeline. 
 The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Kearl, Cold Lake, and Syncrude oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations which are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 
 
 Delivery commitments 
 The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

Oil and gas properties, wells, operations and acreage 
 Production wells 
 The company s production of liquids, bitumen and natural gas is derived from wells located exclusively in Canada. The total number of wells capable of production, in which the company had interests at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, is set forth in the following table. The statistics in the table are determined in part from information received from other operators. The total number of wells decreased in 2022 primarily due to divestment activities and the shut-in of multiple non-economical wells.

Western provinces 
 The company s bitumen leases include about 161,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 68,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totalling about 173,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, about 34,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Aspen area, about 30,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Corner area, about 29,000 net acres in the Clarke Creek area and about 18,000 net acres in the Chard area. The 173,000 net acres are suitable for in-situ recovery techniques. 
 The company s share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 55,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic crude oil acreage. 
 Oil sands leases have an exploration period of 15 years and are continued beyond that point by payment of escalating rentals or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 
 The company holds interests in an additional 395,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas. In 2022, the company divested its interest in Horn River totalling about 103,000 net acres and its interest in XTO Energy Canada totalling about 365,000 net acres. 
 Crude oil and natural gas leases and licences from the western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by proven production capability. 
 Canada lands 
 Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 
 Exploration licences on Canada lands have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 
 The company s net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through ELs and SDLs. 
 Atlantic offshore 
 Exploration licences on Atlantic offshore have a finite term. The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production licences or held by SDLs.

Downstream 
 
 Supply and trading 
 The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at negotiated market prices, in addition to undertaking trading activities. Purchases and sales are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including ExxonMobil. 
 
 Transportation 
 Imperial currently transports the company s crude oil production and third-party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal has total capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 
 
 Refining 
 The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. The company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 
 The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput and utilization during the three years ended December 31, 2022, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2022, were as follows.

Accordingly, actual capacities may be higher or lower than rated capacities due to changes in refinery operation and the type of crude oil available for processing. 
 2022 
 Improved refinery throughput in 2022 was primarily driven by increased demand and reduced turnaround activity. 
 2021 
 Improved refinery throughput in 2021 primarily reflects reduced impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a planned turnaround at Strathcona. 
 
 Distribution 
 The company maintains a nationwide distribution system to move petroleum products to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates fuel terminals across the country, as well as natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of two products pipeline companies. 
 
 15 

Marketing 
 The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products through Esso and Mobil-branded sites and independent marketers. At the end of 2022, there were about 2,400 sites operating under a branded wholesaler model, in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards, whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties. 
 Imperial also sells petroleum products, including fuel, asphalt and lubricants, to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers, as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded fuel and lubricant resellers. 
 The approximate daily volumes of net petroleum products (excluding purchases / sales contracts with the same counterparty) sold during the three years ended December 31, 2022, are set out in the following table. 
 
 thousands of barrels per day 2022 2021 2020 Gasolines 229 224 215 Heating, diesel and jet fuels 176 160 146 Lube oils and other products 47 45 40 Heavy fuel oils 23 27 20 Net petroleum product sales 475 456 421 
 In 2022, improved petroleum product sales primarily reflects increased demand. 
 In 2021, improved petroleum product sales primarily reflects reduced impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Chemical 
 The company s Chemical operations manufacture and market benzene, aromatic and aliphatic solvents, plasticizer intermediates, polyethylene resin, and markets refinery grade propylene. Its petrochemical and polyethylene manufacturing operations are located in Sarnia, Ontario, adjacent to the company s petroleum refinery. 
 The company s total petrochemical sales volumes during the three years ended December 31, 2022, were as follows. 
 
 thousands of tonnes 2022 2021 2020 Total petrochemical sales 842 831 749 
 In 2022, sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales of propylene and polyethylene, partially offset by lower intermediates. 
 In 2021, sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales of intermediates and aromatics. 
 
 16 

Human capital resources 
 Imperial operates in a complex, competitive and changing business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the company s philosophy on talent development. 
 Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. The company s compensation is market competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by individual performance. In addition, benefits and workplace programs support the company s talent management approach, and are designed to attract and retain employees for a long-term career. Overall, this multifaceted approach has resulted in strong employee retention. 
 Imperial views diversity as an opportunity. The company encourages and respects diversity of thought, ideas, and perspective in its workforce. The company considers diversity through all stages of employment including recruitment, training and development of its employees. Imperial s goal is to reflect the mix and diversity of the communities where it operates, and it continues to focus on diverse representation at all levels of the organization. 
 The number of regular employees was about 5,300 at the end of 2022 (2021 - 5,400, 2020 - 5,800). Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full-time or part-time for the company and are covered by the company s benefit plans and programs. 
 
 Competition 
 The Canadian energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The energy and petrochemical industries also compete with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. Certain industry participants, including Imperial, are expanding investments in lower-emission energy and emission-reduction services and technologies. 
 17 

Government regulations 
 
 Petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights 
 Most of the company s petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights, in the form of leases or licences, are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum, natural gas and / or oil sands on the leased lands for a specified period. 
 In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 
 The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 
 
 Project approval 
 Approvals and licences from relevant provincial or federal governmental or regulatory bodies are required for the company to carry out, or make modifications to, its oil and gas activities. The project approval process for major projects can involve, among other things, environmental assessments (including relevant mitigation measures), stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and input regarding project concerns, and public hearings. Approval may be subject to various conditions and commitments arising through these processes. 
 Approval of large energy projects may be impacted by the environmental assessment framework under Canada's Impact Assessment Act (IAA). The IAA includes broader consideration for social, health, and gender-based impacts, the impact on Canada s climate change commitments (including a requirement under the Strategic Assessment for Climate Change to provide a credible plan for the project to deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050), reliance on strategic and regional assessments and adjusted regulatory review timelines. 
 
 Environmental protection 
 The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations as a priority. The company is subject to extensive environmental regulations in Canada that apply to all phases of exploration, development, operation, and final closure. These requirements cover the management and monitoring of potential environmental impacts during active operations, including practices for land disturbance, wildlife protection, specifications for equipment operation and material storage and limitations on discharges to the environment. It also includes conducting environmental surveys and collecting continuous operational measurements and sampling to confirm that environmental practices are adequately protecting the environment. These regulations also specify the actions and requirements for final reclamation, abandonment and closure of facilities. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. The company also maintains extensive operating procedures, processes and emergency response plans to address environmental risks at its operations. 
 As discussed in Item 1A. Risk factors in this report, compliance with existing and potential future government regulations, including environmental regulations, may have material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the company. Imperial takes new and ongoing measures throughout its operations each year to prevent and minimize the impact of its operations on air, land and water. These include significant investments in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, continued evaluation and implementation of new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adherence to federal and provincial greenhouse gas emissions reduction and reporting programs, enhanced water and land management, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about 4.5 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2022, the company s environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately 1.4 billion, which was spent primarily on activities to protect the air, land and water, including remediation projects. Environmental expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 1.8 billion in 2023, with capital expenditures expected to account for approximately 65 percent of the total. Costs for 2024 are anticipated to increase to approximately 2.2 billion, with capital expenditures expected to account for approximately 69 percent of the total.

Crude oil 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 
 Additionally, the Government of Alberta has in the past used temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations to impose production limits on large producers in Alberta, such as those implemented in 2019 and repealed in 2021. 
 Exports 
 Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require the prior approval of the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) and the Government of Canada. Export contracts of less than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require an order from the CER. 
 
 Natural gas 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on Imperial s 2022 gas production rates. 
 Exports 
 The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas. Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the CER and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by CER order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months. 
 
 Royalties 
 The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 
 Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude, see Upstream section entitled Present activities under Item 1 on page 12 . 

Investment Canada Act 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 
 The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canada s cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. 
 By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by ExxonMobil, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 
 19 

Competition Act 
 The Competition Bureau seeks to ensure that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have, or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 
 An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. An ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.

Item 1A. Risk factors 
 Imperial s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in oil, gas and petrochemical businesses, and the pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities. Many of these risk factors are not within Imperial s control and could adversely affect Imperial s business, financial and operating results, or financial position. These risk factors include: 
 
 Supply and demand 
 The oil, gas, fuels and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means the company s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, natural gas and petrochemical prices, and by changes in margins on refined products and petrochemicals. Crude oil, natural gas, petrochemical and petroleum product prices and margins depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product. Commodity prices have been volatile, and the company expects that volatility to continue. Any material decline in crude oil prices could have a material adverse effect on Imperial s Upstream operations, financial position, proved reserves and the amount spent to develop reserves. On the other hand, a material increase in crude oil prices could have a material adverse effect on Imperial s Downstream margins, depending on the market conditions for refined products. The company's pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and lower-emission fuels also depends on the growth and development of markets for those products and services, including implementation of supportive government policies and developments in technology to enable those products and services to be provided on a cost-effective basis at commercial scale. See "Climate change, energy transition and greenhouse gas restrictions" in this Item 1A. The company may also be impacted by changes in other commodities the company utilizes, such as prices and availability of feedstocks for lower-emission fuels including renewable diesel. 
 Economic conditions 
 The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on the company s results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions such as changes in population growth rates, government regulation or austerity programs, trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade, security or public health issues and responses, the inability to access debt markets due to rating, banking, or legal constraints, liquidity crises, other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to Imperial. 
 Other demand-related factors 
 Factors that may affect the demand for crude oil, gas, fuels and petrochemicals, and therefore could impact Imperial s results include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for our products, including lower demand for gasoline, impacting Downstream results in the winter; increased competitiveness of, or government policy support for, alternative energy sources; new product quality regulations; technological changes or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for the company s products, including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products; broad-based changes in personal income levels, interest rates and inflation; and security or public health issues and responses such as epidemics and pandemics. See also Climate change, energy transition and greenhouse gas restrictions below. 

21 

Other supply-related factors 
 Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on affected products. Crude oil, gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as the level of and adherence by participating countries or others to production quotas established by OPEC or OPEC+ and other agreements among sovereigns, government policies that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs, including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and previous Government of Alberta curtailment regulations, the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected pipeline or rail constraints that may disrupt and have in the past disrupted supplies. For example, Russia's military action in Ukraine has impacted global crude oil and gas supply levels and prices, and continues to contribute to a volatile commodity environment, the duration of which is uncertain. Technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals. 
 Canadian-specific market factors 
 The market price for western Canadian heavy crude oil is typically lower than light and medium grades of oil, principally due to the higher transportation and refining costs. Western Canadian crude oil may also be subject to limits on transportation capacity to markets. Future crude price differentials between western Canadian crude oil relative to prices in the U.S. Gulf Coast are uncertain and changes in the heavy or light crude oil differentials could have a material adverse effect on the company s business. Increased differentials, have in the past, led the Government of Alberta to enact temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations that imposed production limits on large producers in Alberta such as Imperial. Although the regulatory authority to impose curtailments was repealed at the end of 2021, the use of similar curtailment regulations in the future could have an adverse effect on the company s business. A significant portion of the company s production is bitumen, which is blended with diluent for transportation and marketability of heavy crude oil. Increases to diluent prices, relative to heavy crude oil prices, could also have an adverse effect on the company s business. 
 
 Other market factors 
 Market factors may also result in losses from commodity derivatives and other instruments used to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes. Imperial s future business results, including cash flows and financing needs, will also be affected by the rate of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the occurrence and severity of future outbreaks, the responsive actions taken by governments and others, and the resulting effects on regional and global markets and economies. If the company s mitigation and response efforts prove insufficient, then large outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics or other health crises such as COVID-19 at operating sites, particularly in remote locations and where work camps are utilized, could materially impact the company s personnel and its operations, reducing productivity and increasing costs. 
 
 Government and political factors 
 Imperial s results can be adversely impacted by political, legal or regulatory developments affecting operations and markets. Changes in government policy or regulations, changes in law or interpretation of settled law, challenges to legislative jurisdiction between different levels of government, third-party opposition to company or infrastructure projects, and duration of regulatory reviews could impact Imperial s existing operations and planned projects. This includes actions by policy-makers, regulators or other actors to delay or deny necessary licences and permits, restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the operation of third-party infrastructure that the company relies on, such as pipelines to transport the company s upstream production to market or that supply feedstock to the company s refineries. Additionally, changes in environmental regulations, assessment processes or other laws and increasing and expanding stakeholder consultation (including Indigenous stakeholders), may increase the cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities and adversely impact the company s results. 
 Other government and political factors that could adversely affect the company s financial results include increases in taxes or government royalty rates (including retroactive claims) and changes in trade policies and agreements. Changes in taxation policy, such as the Government of Canada announcement in 2022 of a tax on share buybacks, could impact the company s results and ability to return surplus cash to shareholders. Further, the adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards, and the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components could affect the company s operations. Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. 
 22 

Governments are also introducing bans on certain technologies that could impact demand for products, such as the Government of Canada s intention to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine cars and light trucks beginning in 2035. Governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources, and the success of these initiatives may decrease demand for the company s products. Actions by policy makers, regulators or others may require changes in the company s business or strategy that could result in reduced returns. 
 Governments may establish regulations with respect to the control of the company s production, such as the Government of Alberta's temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations that were in effect from 2019 through 2021, as discussed in the Supply and demand section above. Government intervention in free markets may introduce unintended consequences such as market volatility and uncertainty, misallocation of resources, and erosion of investor confidence. 
 
 Environmental risks 
 All phases of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of Canadian federal, provincial, territorial and municipal laws and regulations, as well as international conventions (collectively, environmental legislation ). 
 Environmental legislation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. As well, environmental regulations are imposed on the qualities and compositions of the products sold and imported, and include those aimed at reducing consumption or addressing environmental concerns with certain end products. Changes to these requirements could adversely affect the company s results by impacting commodity prices, increasing costs and reducing revenues. 
 Environmental legislation also requires that wells, facility sites and other properties associated with the company s operations be operated, maintained, monitored, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. This includes the requirement for specific approvals for many areas of interaction with the environment, such as land use, air quality, water use, biodiversity protection and waste, including mine tailings management. The failure to operate as anticipated and adhere to conditions, the delay or denial of approvals and changes to conditions or regulations could impact the company s ability to operate its projects and facilities and adversely affect the company s results. 
 
 Regulation of air, water and land 
 The implementation of, and compliance with, policies and regulations related to air, water and land, such as Alberta s Lower Athabasca Regional Plan and Wetland Policy applicable to the company s oil sands assets, could restrict development in current and future areas of operation. The company also depends on water obtained under licences for withdrawal, storage, reuse and discharge in both its Upstream and Downstream businesses, including future projects and expansions. Water use may be limited by regulatory requirements, seasonal fluctuations, competing demands, environmental sensitivities, increasingly stringent water management standards, and changes to conditions or availability of licences, which may restrict and adversely affect the company s operations. Additionally, a number of air quality regulations and frameworks are being developed and implemented at the federal and provincial levels, including sulphur dioxide limits for refineries in Ontario, and could impact existing and planned operations and projects through increased capital and operating expenses including retrofits to existing equipment, and could adversely impact the company s operations and financial results. 
 Regulation of wildlife 
 Federal and provincial legislation aimed at protecting sensitive, threatened or endangered wildlife, such as woodland caribou and species of migratory birds, may also increase restoration and offset costs and impact the company s projects. If it is determined that such wildlife and their habitat are not sufficiently protected, governments or other parties may take actions to limit the pace or ability to develop in areas of Imperial s current and future projects. 

23 

Regulation of oil sands 
 The company s mining operations are subject to tailings management regulations that establish approval, monitoring, reporting and performance criteria for tailings ponds and management plans. Further, the absence or evolving nature of policies and regulations for the timing and closure of tailings ponds, including the approved technologies and methods for closure (such as the use of end pit lakes and water capped tailings), and dam safety directives, regulations, guides and abandonment requirements could have a material impact on conditions for approvals and ultimate mine closure costs. Additionally, successful management and closure requires the release of water to the environment, and although an Alberta water release policy and federal oil sands effluent regulations are being developed, the timing and impact of these regulations is uncertain and the absence of effective regulation could negatively impact the company s operations and financial results. 
 Environmental assessments 
 In addition, certain types of operations, including exploration and development projects and significant changes to certain existing projects, may require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. The Government of Canada's environmental assessment framework under the Impact Assessment Act expands assessment considerations beyond the environment to include social, health, economic, and gender-based impacts and the impact on Canada s climate change commitments (including a requirement under the Strategic Assessment for Climate Change to provide a credible plan for the project to deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050). It also includes a reliance on strategic and regional assessments and adjusted regulatory review timelines. The impact of this legislation is not fully apparent, but it may impact the cost, manner, duration and ability to advance large energy projects and project expansions. 
 Compliance costs 
 Compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the cessation of operations, imposition of fines and penalties, and liability for clean-up costs and damages. 
 The costs of complying with environmental legislation in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations. The company anticipates that changes in environmental legislation may require, among other things, reductions in emissions from its operations to the air and water and may result in increased capital expenditures. Changes in environmental legislation (including, but not limited to, application of regulations related to air, water, land, biodiversity and waste, such as mine tailings and the production or use of new or recycled plastics) may increase the cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities. Future changes in environmental legislation and the enforcement of regulations could occur and result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines, penalties and liability, and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations. 
 Risk Management 
 There are operational risks inherent in oil and gas exploration and production activities, as well as the potential to incur substantial financial liabilities, if the company does not manage those risks effectively. Environmental hazards including severe weather events may impact the company s operational performance, such as extreme cold weather that makes mining operations more difficult. The ability to insure risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient to cover the likely cost of a major adverse operating event. Accordingly, the company s primary focus is on prevention, including through its rigorous operations integrity management system. The company s future results will depend on the continued effectiveness of these efforts.

Climate change, energy transition and greenhouse gas restrictions 
 Net-zero scenarios 
 Driven by concern over the risks of climate change, the provinces and the Government of Canada have adopted or have revised regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas, and their products. These actions are being taken both independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of United Nations Conference of the Parties summits under which Canada has endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2 over the coming decades, with an ambition ultimately to achieve net zero . Net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere. Expectations for transition of the world s energy system to lower-emission sources, and ultimately net zero, derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and reflect substantial uncertainties. The company s actions with respect to the energy transition, including its announced goal, ultimately, to achieve company-wide net-zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from its operated assets, carries risks that the transition, including underlying technologies, policies, and markets as discussed in more detail below, will not develop at the pace or in the manner estimated by current net-zero scenarios. The success of Imperial's strategy for the energy transition will also depend on its ability to recognize key signposts of change in the global energy system on a timely basis, and the corresponding ability to direct investment to the technologies and businesses, at the appropriate stage of development, to best capitalize on the company's competitive strengths. 
 Greenhouse gas restrictions 
 Government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include adoption of carbon emissions pricing, cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, emissions limits, increased mileage and other efficiency standards, low carbon fuels standards, mandates for sales of electrical vehicles and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. The Government of Canada has updated its nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, a substantial increase in ambition beyond its original NDC. To implement these goals, the Government of Canada uses a number of policy tools including the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA), which sets a federal backstop carbon price Canada-wide through a carbon levy applied to fossil fuels 50 per tonne CO2 equivalent emissions starting in 2022 and increasing by 15 per tonne annually to 170 per tonne in 2030), and an output-based pricing system for large industrial emitters. Under the GGPPA, provinces are required to either adopt the GGPPA, or obtain equivalency by adopting a price-based system (with a minimum of the federal carbon pricing) or a cap and trade system. Further, in 2021 the Government of Canada enacted legislation to formalize Canada s target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and establish interim emissions reductions targets at five year intervals. Under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, the Government of Canada is required to develop an emissions reduction plan for 2030 consistent with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. 
 
 The Government of Alberta obtained federal equivalency for its Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction Regulation (TIER) that came into effect in 2020 and applies to facilities with CO2 emissions in excess of 100,000 tonnes per year. TIER is designed to reduce emissions by putting a price on nominally 10 percent of a facility s emissions in 2020. This price increased to 11 percent in 2021 and 12 percent in 2022, with the oil sands mining and upgrading facilities increasing to 17 percent in 2021 and 18 percent in 2022, and these percentages are anticipated to increase by 2 percent per year starting in 2023, followed by an increase of 4 percent in 2029 and 2030 for the oil sands sector. Further, the Alberta Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act sets a limit of 100 megatonnes of CO2 per year of emissions in the oil sands sector, but oil sands emissions remain below the limit and it is not yet possible to predict the impact of this act on the company s future oil sands operations in Alberta. With respect to other provinces, Ontario obtained federal equivalency for its Emissions Performance System, which puts a price on 8 percent of a facility s emissions, increasing by 2.4 percent in 2023 followed by 1.5 percent in 2024. British Columbia has carbon pricing in place for all emissions, with pricing expected to meet or exceed the federal carbon pricing schedule in 2023. Increases in carbon pricing could adversely impact the company s operations and financial results unless the company can adapt its operations through technological innovation and investment in a cost-effective manner or meet compliance through offset credits or other mechanisms. 

25 

There are also various low carbon fuel standards being developed or already applicable to the company s products. In 2022, the Government of Canada finalized draft regulations for the Clean Fuel Regulations, which will require the reduction in carbon intensity of liquid transportation fuels supplied in Canada starting in July 2023. The regulations build upon the existing federal renewable fuels regulations that require fuel producers and importers to have a specified amount of renewable fuel in gasoline and diesel. Similarly, British Columbia introduced a Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2013, which increased to a 10 percent carbon intensity reduction requirement in 2020. Beginning in 2023, the British Columbia government has further increased the carbon intensity reductions to a total of 30 percent by 2030 (compared to the 2010 baseline). Compliance can be achieved by either blending renewable fuels with low carbon intensity or by purchasing credits. 
 The Government of Canada's Impact Assessment Act links environmental assessment approvals to climate change-related goals, and has also discussed a goal of establishing legally-binding policies for being carbon-neutral by 2050. Changes and policies related to this act could adversely impact the company s ability to progress new oil sands projects. 
 International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering climate change and greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. Such laws and policies could make Imperial s products more expensive and less competitive, reduce or delay available business opportunities, reduce demand for hydrocarbons, and shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower greenhouse gas emission energy sources. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase compliance and abatement costs including taxes and levies, increase abandonment and reclamation obligations and impact decommissioning timelines, lengthen project evaluation and implementation times, impact reserves evaluations and affect operations. Increased costs may not be recoverable in the market place, could negatively affect our returns and could reduce the global competitiveness of the company s crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Governments may also impose restrictions on production of, or emissions from, oil and gas to the extent they view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies. For example, the Government of Canada announced its intention to pursue a cap on greenhouse gas emission from oil and gas activities by 2030. Concern over the risks of climate change may lead governments to make laws applicable to the energy industry progressively more stringent over time. Political and other actors and their agents are also increasingly seeking to advance climate change objectives indirectly, such as by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies. 
 Technology and lower-emission solutions 
 Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve net-zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions from high-intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires. The company s future results and ability to succeed through the energy transition while helping meet Canada's emission-reduction goals and meet its own net-zero and emission reduction goals will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration efforts. It will also rely on the company s ability to adapt and apply the strengths of its current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. 
 
 Policy and market development 
 The scale of the world s energy system means that, in addition to developments in technology discussed above, a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy. The company s ability to develop and deploy CCS and other lower-emission energy technologies at commercial scale will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investments. Policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects, including increased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures; and local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors, with resulting adverse effects on the company s business. 
 
 In addition, the existence of supportive policies in any jurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future. See also the discussion of Supply and demand , Government and political factors , and Management effectiveness in this Item 1A. 
 26 

Currency 
 Prices for commodities produced by the company are commonly benchmarked in U.S. dollars. The majority of Imperial s sales and purchases are related to these industry U.S. dollar benchmarks. As the company records and reports its financial results in Canadian dollars, to the extent that the value of the Canadian dollar strengthens, the company s reported earnings will be negatively affected. The company does not currently make use of derivative instruments to offset exposures associated with foreign currency. 
 
 Other business risks 
 Imperial is reliant on a number of key chemicals, catalysts and third-party service providers, including input and output commodity transportation (pipelines, rail, trucking, marine) and utilities providing services, including electricity and water, to various company operations. The lack of availability, capacity or proximity, with respect to pipeline facilities and railcars, could negatively impact Imperial s ability to produce at capacity levels. Transportation disruptions, including those caused by events unrelated to the company s operations, could adversely affect the company s price realizations, refining operations and sales volumes. This includes outages of key third-party infrastructure, such as pipelines servicing the company s oil sands assets or pipelines supplying feedstock to its refineries, which could impact the company s ability to operate its assets or limit the ability to deliver production and products to market. A third-party utilities outage could have an adverse impact on the company s operations and ability to produce. 
 The company also enters into contractual relationships with suppliers, partners and other counterparties to procure and sell goods and services, and the company s operations, market position and financial condition may be adversely impacted if these counterparties do not fulfil their obligations. Imperial may also be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation resulting from its operations or by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and success is not guaranteed, and the company may incur significant expenses and devote significant resources in defending litigation. 
 Current and future increases in operating costs such as energy, transportation and materials, including through shipping, supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures, could adversely affect the company s financial results if it is unable to control or offset these costs. In addition to direct potential impacts on the company's costs and revenues, market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly impact results to the extent such factors reduce general rates of economic growth and therefore energy demand, as discussed under Supply and demand". Further, with inflation rising in Canada and other countries throughout 2022, governments have increased interest rates which may further impact the company through the availability of financing, cost of debt, and exchange rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our businesses is included or incorporated by reference under Item 7A Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report. 
 
 Operational and other factors 
 In addition to external economic and political factors, Imperial s future business results also depend on the company s ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within its control. The extent to which Imperial manages these factors will impact its performance relative to competition. For projects in which the company is not the operator such as Syncrude, Imperial depends on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom the company does not control. 

Project management 
 The nature of the company s Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses depend on complex, long-term, and capital intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. This includes development, engineering, construction, commissioning and ongoing operational activities and expertise. The company s results are affected by its ability to develop and operate projects and facilities as planned, and by events or conditions that affect the advancement, operation, cost or results of such projects or facilities. These risks include the company s ability to obtain the necessary environmental and other regulatory approvals; changes in regulations; the ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers and others; the ability to model and optimize reservoir performance; changes in resources and operating costs including the availability and cost of materials, equipment and qualified personnel; the impact of general economic, business and market conditions; and the company s ability to respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start-up or cause unscheduled downtime. 
 27 

Operational efficiency 
 An important component of Imperial s competitive performance, especially given the commodity based nature of Imperial s business, is the ability to operate efficiently, including the company s ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technological improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of the company s asset portfolio. The company s operations and results also depend on key personnel and subject matter expertise, the recruitment, development and retention of high caliber employees, and the availability of skilled labour. 
 
 Research and development and technical change 
 Imperial relies upon the research and development organizations of the company and ExxonMobil, with whom the company conducts shared research. Innovation and technology are important to maintain the company s competitive position, especially in light of the technological nature of Imperial s business and the need for continuous efficiency improvement. 
 The company s research and development organizations must be able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity. To remain competitive, the company must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new technologies including growing the company s capabilities to utilize digital data technologies to gain new business insights. There are risks associated with projects that rely on new technology, including that the results of implementing the new technology may differ from simulated, piloted or expected results. The failure to develop and adopt new technology may have an adverse impact on the company s operations, ability to meet regulatory requirements and operational commitments and targets (including environmental sustainability and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions), and financial results. 
 
 Safety, business controls and environmental risk management 
 The scope and nature of the company s operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures and crude oil spills. Imperial s operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and environmental hazards and risks, including severe weather (such as extreme cold weather events that impacted the company's oil sands operations in early 2022) and geological events. The company s results depend on management s ability to minimize these inherent risks, to effectively control business activities and to minimize the potential for human error. Imperial applies rigorous management systems, including a combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. The company also maintains a disciplined framework of internal controls and applies a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. The company s upstream and downstream operations may experience loss of production, slowdowns or shutdowns and increased costs due to the failure of interdependent systems, and substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if the company s management systems and controls do not function as intended. 
 
 Cybersecurity 
 Imperial is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of sources, including state-sponsored actors. Imperial s defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions: non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups; annual internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness via mock threats; and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery. 
 If the measures the company is taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if the company s proprietary data is otherwise not protected, the company, as well as its customers, employees or third parties, could be adversely affected. The company is exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events that may affect the operations of third parties, including our partners, suppliers, service providers (including providers of cloud-based services for our data or applications), and customers. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost or stolen; result in employee, customer or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt the company s business operations. Imperial could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption, in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm. 
 28 

Preparedness 
 The company s operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events. Our facilities are designed, engineered, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties, including those associated with permafrost stability, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, earthquakes and other events. Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Imperial s ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of its robust facility engineering, rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity planning. 
 
 Reputation 
 Imperial s reputation is an important corporate asset. Factors that could have an impact on the company s reputation including an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption; changes in consumer views concerning the company s products; a perception by investors or others that insufficient progress is being made with respect to the company s ambition in the energy transition, or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns; and other adverse events such as those described in this Item 1A. Negative impacts on Imperial s reputation could, in turn, make it more difficult for the company to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, obtain financing, and attract talent, or they could reduce consumer demand for the company s branded products. Imperial s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of the industry as a whole, including public and investor perception of Alberta oil sands in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact. 
 
 Reserves 
 The company s future production and cash flows from bitumen, synthetic crude oil, liquids and natural gas reserves are highly dependent upon the company s success in exploiting its current reserves. To maintain production and cash flows over the long term, the company must replace produced reserves, which can be accomplished through exploration discovery of new resources, appraisal and investments in developing discovered resources, or acquisition of reserves. To the extent cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund capital expenditures and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable, the company s ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain and grow oil and natural gas reserves will be adversely impacted. In addition, the company may be unable to find and develop or acquire additional reserves to replace oil and natural gas production at acceptable costs. 
 
 Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows involve many uncertainties, including factors beyond the company s control. Key factors with uncertainty include: geological and engineering estimates, including that additional information obtained through seismic and drilling programs, reservoir analysis and production and operational history may result in revisions to reserves; the assumed effects of regulation or changes to regulation by government agencies, including royalty frameworks and environmental regulations (such as the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including accelerated timelines and emission reduction stringency to meet government goals, which could impose significant compliance costs on the company, require new technology, or impact the economic viability of certain projects); future commodity prices, where low commodity prices may affect reserves development; abandonment and reclamation costs, including reclamation and tailings requirements for mining operations; and operating costs. Actual production, revenues, taxes and royalties, development costs, abandonment and reclamation costs, and operating expenditures, with respect to reserves, will likely vary from such estimates, and such variances could be material.

 There is no Canadian tax on gains from selling shares or debt instruments owned by non-residents not carrying on business in Canada, as long as the shareholder does not, in any given 60 month period, own 25 percent or more of the shares of the company. 
 Canada has approved several positions with respect to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting MLI , which may impact the taxability of dividends and capital gains in Canada if the shareholder s country of residence has also approved these same positions of the MLI. 
 During the fourth quarter, the company did not issue or sell any unregistered equity securities.

 (a) On June 27, 2022, the company announced by news release that it had received final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange for a new normal course issuer bid to continue its existing share purchase program. The program enabled the company to purchase up to a maximum of 31,833,809 common shares during the period June 29, 2022 to June 28, 2023. This maximum included shares purchased under the normal course issuer bid and from Exxon Mobil Corporation concurrent with, but outside of the normal course issuer bid. As in the past, Exxon Mobil Corporation advised the company that it intended to participate to maintain its ownership percentage at approximately 69.6 percent. Imperial accelerated share purchases under the normal course issuer bid program, and the program completed on October 21, 2022 as a result of the company purchasing the maximum allowable number of shares under the program. 
 (b) On November 4, 2022, the company commenced a substantial issuer bid pursuant to which it offered to purchase for cancellation up to 1.5 billion of its common shares through a modified Dutch auction and proportionate tender offer. The substantial issuer bid was completed on December 14, 2022, with the company taking up and paying for 20,689,655 common shares at a price of 72.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase of 1.5 billion and 3.4 percent of Imperial s issued and outstanding shares at the close of business on October 31, 2022. This included 14,399,985 shares purchased from Exxon Mobil Corporation by way of a proportionate tender to maintain its ownership percentage at approximately 69.6 percent. 

The company will continue to evaluate the renewal of its normal course issuer bid share purchase program in June 2023 in the context of its overall capital activities. 
 Purchase plans may be modified at any time without prior notice.

Frequently used terms 
 Listed below are definitions of several of Imperial s key business and financial performance measures. The definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and how they are calculated. Certain measures included in this document are not prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These measures constitute non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, and specified financial measures under National Instrument 52-112 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure of the Canadian Securities Administrators. 
 
 Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, and other information required by these regulations, have been provided. Non-GAAP financial measures and specified financial measures are not standardized financial measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized definition. As such, these measures may not be directly comparable to measures presented by other companies, and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Capital employed 
 Capital employed is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a measurement of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how capital is used by the business, it includes the company s property, plant and equipment and other assets, less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the company, it includes total debt and equity. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is total assets within the company s Consolidated balance sheet. Both of these views include the company s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the company believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measurement of capital employed.

Return on average capital employed (ROCE) 
 ROCE is a non-GAAP ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment net income divided by average business segment capital employed (an average of the beginning and end-of-year amounts). Segment net income includes Imperial s share of segment net income of equity companies, consistent with the definition used for capital employed, and excludes the cost of financing. Capital employed is a non-GAAP financial measure and is disclosed and reconciled above. The company s total ROCE is net income excluding the after-tax cost of financing divided by total average capital employed. The company has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity in a capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.

 Cash flows from operating activities and asset sales 
 Cash flows from operating activities and asset sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales reported in the Consolidated statement of cash flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash both from operating the company s assets and from the divesting of assets. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is cash flows from (used in) operating activities within the company s Consolidated statement of cash flows. The company employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the company s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they no longer meet these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, the company believes it is useful for investors to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Operating costs 
 Operating costs is a non-GAAP financial measure that are the costs during the period to produce, manufacture, and otherwise prepare the company s products for sale including energy costs, staffing and maintenance costs. It excludes the cost of raw materials, taxes and interest expense and are on a before-tax basis. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is total expenses within the company s Consolidated statement of income. While the company is responsible for all revenue and expense elements of net income, operating costs represent the expenses most directly under the company s control and therefore, are useful in evaluating the company s performance.

Net income (loss) excluding identified items 
 Net income (loss) excluding identified items is a non-GAAP financial measure that is total net income (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least 100 million in a given quarter. The net income (loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than 100 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is net income (loss) within the company s Consolidated statement of income. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The company believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Net income (loss) excluding identified items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All identified items are presented on an after-tax basis.

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 
 Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis of Imperial s financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Imperial Oil Limited. 
 The company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a variety of specialty products. 
 Imperial, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new Canadian energy supplies. The company s operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, Chemicals, and Corporate and other. The company s integrated business model generally reduces the company s risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, Imperial s investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in its long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities. The Corporate Plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting operating and capital objectives, in addition to providing the economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is ExxonMobil s Outlook for Energy , and Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Price ranges for crude oil, natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes and operating costs including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are based on Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually and are utilized for investment evaluation purposes. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. Once the company makes major investments, it completes a reappraisal process to ensure that it learns from the investment decision and incorporates the lessons into future projects. 
 The term project as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.

Business environment 
 Long-term business outlook 
 The Long-term business outlook is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation s Outlook for Energy (the Outlook), which combined with the near-term pathways, is used to help inform the company s long-term business strategies and investment plans. 
 The company s business planning is underpinned by a deep understanding of long-term market fundamentals. These fundamentals include supply and demand trends, the scale and variety of energy needs worldwide; capability, practicality and affordability of energy alternatives including low-carbon solutions; greenhouse gas emission-reduction technologies; and supportive government policies. The Outlook considers these fundamentals to form the basis for the company s long-term business planning, investment decisions, and research programs. The Outlook reflects the company s view of global energy demand and supply through 2050. It is a projection based on current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. 
 The Outlook uses projections and scenarios from reputable third parties such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IEA describes the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) as extremely challenging, requiring all stakeholders - governments, businesses, investors, and citizens - to take immediate, unprecedented action. The IEA acknowledges that society is not currently on the IEA NZE pathway. No single transition pathway can be reasonably predicted, given the wide range of uncertainties. Key unknowns include yet-to-be-developed government policies, market conditions, and advances in technology that may influence the cost, pace, and potential availability of certain pathways. Scenarios that employ a full complement of technology options are likely to provide the most economically efficient pathways. 
 By 2050, the world s population is projected at around 9.7 billion people, or about 2 billion more than in 2021. Coincident with this population increase, the Outlook projects worldwide economic growth to average close to 2.5 percent per year, with economic output growing by around 110 percent by 2050 compared to 2021. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by almost 15 percent from 2021 to 2050. This increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)). 
 As expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy-efficient technologies and practices, as well as lower-emission products, will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world s economy through 2050, affecting energy requirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs. 
 Under the Outlook, global electricity demand is expected to increase over 75 percent from 2021 to 2050, with developing countries likely to account for about 80 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. The share of coal-fired generation is expected to decline substantially and approach 15 percent of the world s electricity in 2050, versus nearly 35 percent in 2021, in part due to policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address risks related to climate change. From 2021 to 2050, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power and renewables is expected to more than double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and solar is expected to increase more than 550 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g., hydropower) to account for over 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2050. Total renewables are expected to reach about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2050. Natural gas and nuclear are expected to be about 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of global electricity supplies by 2050. Supplies of electricity by energy type will reflect significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy supplies and policy developments. 

48 

Under the Outlook, energy for transportation including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes is expected to increase by over 30 percent from 2021 to 2050. Transportation energy demand is expected to account for around 65 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak by around 2025, and then decline to levels seen in the early-2000s by 2050, as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe, and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of almost 70 percent. By 2050, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for around 15 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world s commercial transportation fleets are expected to continue to run on liquid fuels, including biofuels, which are expected to be widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes. 
 Almost half of the world s energy use is dedicated to industrial activity. As the global middle class continues to grow, demand for durable products, appliances, and consumable goods will increase. Industry uses energy products both as a fuel and as a feedstock for chemicals, asphalt, lubricants, waxes, and other specialty products. The Outlook anticipates technology advances, as well as the increasing shift toward cleaner forms of energy such as electricity and natural gas, with coal declining. Demand for oil will continue to grow as a feedstock for industry. 
 As populations grow and prosperity rises, more energy will be needed to power homes, offices, schools, shopping centers, hospitals, etc. Combined residential and commercial energy demand is projected to rise by around 15 percent through 2050. Led by the growing economies of developing nations, average worldwide household electricity use will rise about 75 percent between 2021 and 2050. 
 Liquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of transportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2050, global demand for liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 110 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of about 17 percent from 2021. The non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to nearly 70 percent by 2050, as liquid fuels demand in the OECD is expected to decline by around 20 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids, and biofuels are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world s resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2050 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of more economic and lower-carbon supply options. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies. 
 Natural gas is a lower-emission, versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from 2021 to 2050, meeting about 40 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand is expected to rise nearly 25 percent from 2021 to 2050, with around two thirds of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations will help meet these needs. In total, about 50 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting around two-thirds of worldwide demand in 2050. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about 50 percent of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific. 
 The world s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2050. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2050. Coal and natural gas are the next largest sources of energy today, with the share of natural gas growing to more than 25 percent by 2050, while the share of coal falls to about half that of natural gas. Nuclear power is projected to grow, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total renewable energy is expected to exceed 20 percent of global energy by 2050, with other renewables (e.g., biomass, hydropower, geothermal) contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind and solar is expected to increase rapidly, growing over 480 percent from 2021 to 2050, when they are projected to be around 10 percent of the world energy mix.

Decarbonization of industry activities will require a suite of nascent or future lower-carbon technologies and supporting policies. Lower-emission fuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and carbon capture and storage are three key lower-carbon solutions needed to support a lower-emission future, in addition to wind and solar. Along with electrification, lower-emission fuels are expected to play an important role in decarbonization of the transportation sector, particularly in hard-to-decarbonize areas, such as aviation. Low-carbon hydrogen will be a key enabler replacing traditional furnace fuel to decarbonize the industrial sector. Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia are also expected to make inroads into commercial transportation as technology improves to lower its cost and policy develops to support the needed infrastructure development. Carbon capture and storage on its own, or in combination with hydrogen production, is among the few proven technologies that could enable CO2 emission reductions from high-emitting and hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as power generation and heavy industries, including manufacturing, refining and petrochemicals. 
 To meet this projected demand under the Outlook and the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the company anticipates that the world s available oil and gas resource base will grow, not only from new discoveries, but also from increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The investments to develop and supply resources to meet global demand through 2050 will be significant, and would be needed to meet even the rapidly declining demand for oil and gas envisioned in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. 
 International accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. Imperial s estimates of potential costs related to greenhouse gas emissions align with applicable provincial and federal regulations. Additionally, Imperial uses the Outlook as a foundation for estimating energy supply and demand requirements from various energy sources and uses, and the Outlook takes into account policies established to reduce energy related greenhouse gas emissions. The climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the global aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted by the nations that are signatories to the Paris Agreement, as available at the end of 2021. The Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related government policies, which often target specific sectors. As people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The company continues to monitor the updates to the NDCs that nations provided around COP 27 in Egypt in November 2022 as well as other policy developments in light of net-zero ambitions formulated by some nations, including Canada. 
 The information provided in the Outlook includes ExxonMobil's internal estimates and projections based upon internal data and analyses, as well as publicly available information from external sources including the International Energy Agency. 
 
 Progress reducing emissions 
 Practical solutions to the world s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market competition in addition to well-informed, well-designed and transparent policy approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits. Such policies are likely to help manage the risks of climate change while also enabling societies to pursue other high priority goals around the world including clean air and water, access to reliable and affordable energy, and economic progress for all people. The company encourages sound policy solutions that reduce climate-related risks across the economy at the lowest societal cost. All practical and economically viable energy sources will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy needs, as well as the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people. 
 Imperial and its industry peers launched the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero alliance in 2021, with the goal of working collectively with the federal and Alberta governments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals. 

50 

As part of the company s efforts to provide solutions that lower the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of its operations and provide lower life-cycle emissions products to customers, Imperial has announced a company-wide goal to achieve net zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050 in its operated assets through collaboration with government and industry partners. Successful technology development and supportive fiscal and regulatory frameworks will be needed to achieve this goal. This work builds on Imperial s previously announced net-zero goal for operated oil sands as part of the Pathways Alliance initiative, as well as the company s emission intensity reduction goal of 30 percent by 2030 for operated oil sands facilities when compared to 2016 levels. The company plans to achieve its net zero goal by applying oil sands recovery technologies that use less steam, implementing carbon capture and storage and implementing efficiency projects including the use of lower carbon fuels at its operations.

Recent business environment 
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies in the industry invested below the levels needed to maintain or increase production capacity to meet anticipated demand. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this decline in investments accelerated as industry revenue collapsed, resulting in underinvestment and supply tightness as demand for petroleum and petrochemical products recovered. Across late 2021 and the first half of 2022, these reductions, along with supply chain constraints, and a continuation of demand recovery, led to a steady increase in oil and natural gas prices and refining margins. 
 Demand for petroleum and petrochemical products grew in 2022, with the company's financial results benefiting from stronger prices and margins. Commodity and product prices are expected to remain volatile given the current global economic uncertainty and geopolitical events affecting supply and demand, including Russia's military action in Ukraine that has impacted global crude oil and gas supply levels and prices. 
 The general rate of inflation in Canada and many other countries experienced a brief decline in the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, before starting to increase steadily in 2021, due to an imbalance in supply and demand, and continued to increase in 2022. The underlying factors include, but are not limited to, time cycle of capacity investments, supply chain disruptions, shipping bottlenecks, labour constraints, and side effects from monetary and fiscal expansions. The company closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments.

Upstream 
 Overview 
 Imperial produces crude oil and natural gas for sale predominantly into North American markets. Imperial s Upstream business strategies guide the company s exploration, development, production, research and gas marketing activities. These strategies include improving asset reliability, accelerating development and application of high impact technologies, maximizing value by capturing new business opportunities and managing the existing portfolio, as well as pursuing sustainable improvements in organizational efficiency and effectiveness. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operations integrity, commitment to innovative technologies, disciplined approach to investing and cost management, development of employees and investment in the communities within which the company operates. 
 Imperial has a significant oil and gas resource base and a large inventory of potential projects. The company s current investment strategy is to invest for value and select volume growth, with focus on optimization within existing assets, cost reduction opportunities and productivity enhancements that aim to deliver robust returns at a wide range of prices. The company also continues to evaluate opportunities to support long-term growth. Although actual volumes will vary from year to year, the focus is on value-add, long-term growth opportunities within the context of the factors described in Item 1A. Risk factors . Imperial continually evaluates opportunities, including crude shipments by rail and the pace of the development of its Aspen in-situ oil sands project, as economically justified. 
 Prices for most of the company's crude oil sold are referenced to Western Canada Select (WCS) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil markets. Additionally, the market price for WCS is typically lower than light and medium grades of oil, and price differentials between WCS and WTI can fluctuate. 
 Imperial believes prices over the long term will be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activity, alternative energy sources, levels of prosperity, technology advancements, consumer preference and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, logistics constraints, the actions of OPEC, governments, alternative energy sources, and other factors. To manage the risks associated with price, Imperial tests the resiliency of its annual plans and all major investments across a range of price scenarios. 
 
 Key events

Downstream 
 Overview 
 Imperial s Downstream serves predominantly Canadian markets with refining, trading, logistics and marketing activities. Imperial s Downstream business strategies competitively position the company across a range of market conditions. These strategies include targeting industry-leading performance in reliability, safety and operations integrity, as well as maximizing value from advanced technologies, capitalizing on integration across Imperial s businesses, selectively investing for resilient and advantaged returns, operating efficiently and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and services to customers. 
 Imperial owns and operates three refineries in Canada with aggregate distillation capacity of 433,000 barrels per day. Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel, fuel oil and asphalt). Crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for these commodities are determined by the global and regional marketplaces and are influenced by many factors, including global and regional supply / demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import / export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather and political considerations. While industry refining margins significantly impact earnings, strong operations performance, product mix optimization, and disciplined cost control are also critical to the company's strong financial performance. Imperial's integration across the value chain, from refining to marketing, enhances overall value across the fuels business. 
 
 Key events 
 Refining margins increased sharply in 2022 in the face of strengthening demand, low inventory levels, and supply uncertainty. While refining margins are anticipated to remain volatile in the near term, the company continues to closely monitor industry and global economic conditions. 
 
 The company progressed the Strathcona renewable diesel project in 2022, culminating in a final investment decision in January 2023 to construct the largest such facility in Canada, designed to produce more than one billion litres of renewable diesel annually. 
 As described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk factors , proposed carbon policy and other climate related regulations, as well as continued biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the downstream business. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products through Esso and Mobil-branded sites and independent marketers. At the end of 2022, there were about 2,400 sites operating under a branded wholesaler model, in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards, whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties.

Liquidity and capital resources 
 
 Sources and uses of cash 
 The company issues long-term debt from time to time and maintains a commercial paper program. However, internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements. Cash that may be temporarily surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality and investment guidelines to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements and to optimize returns. 
 Cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as petroleum and chemical product margins. In addition, to provide for cash flow in future periods, the company needs to continually find and develop new resources, and continue to develop and apply new technologies to existing fields in order to maintain or increase production. 
 The company s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Imperial s portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks for the company and its cash flows. Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for its operations and fixed commitments. 
 Funding of registered retirement plans complies with federal and provincial pension regulations, and the company makes contributions to the plans based on an independent actuarial valuation completed at least once every three years depending on funding status. The most recent valuation of the company s registered retirement plans was completed as at December 31, 2019. A valuation of the company s registered retirement plans as at December 31, 2022 is expected to be completed in 2023. The company contributed 174 million to the registered retirement plans in 2022. Future funding requirements are not expected to affect the company s existing capital investment plans or its ability to pursue new investment opportunities.

 16 19 19 (a) Debt, defined as the sum of Notes and loans payable and Long-term debt (page 76 ), divided by capital, defined as the sum of debt and Total shareholders equity (page 76 ). 
 
 Debt-related interest incurred in 2022, before capitalization of interest, was 111 million, up from 63 million in 2021. The weighted-average interest rate on the company s debt was 2.2 percent in 2022, up from 1.2 percent in 2021. 
 The company s financial strength represents a competitive advantage of strategic importance providing it the opportunity to readily access capital markets across a range of market conditions and enables the company to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value. 
 
 Contractual obligations 
 The company has contractual obligations involving commitments to third parties that impact its liquidity and capital resource needs. These contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, other long-term obligations, and firm capital commitments. Further information on this topic can be found in notes 4, 5, 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Other long-term purchase agreements are commitments that are non-cancelable, or cancelable only under certain conditions, as well as long-term commitments, other than unconditional purchase obligations. They include primarily transportation services agreements, raw material supply and community benefits agreements. The total obligation at year-end 2022 was 8.8 billion, of which 783 million is due in 2023, and 670 million is due in 2024. 
 61 

Litigation and other contingencies 
 As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements on page 97 , a variety of claims have been made against Imperial and its subsidiaries. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuits against the company will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. 
 Additionally, as discussed in note 9, Imperial was contingently liable at December 31, 2022, for guarantees relating to performance under contracts. These guarantees do not have a material effect on the company s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. 
 There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition. 
 
 Capital and exploration expenditures 
 Capital and exploration expenditures represent the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, additions to finance leases, additional investments and acquisitions; exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated statement of income; and the company s share of similar costs for equity companies. Capital and exploration expenditures exclude the purchase of carbon emission credits. While Imperial s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.

 For the Upstream segment, capital and exploration expenditures were primarily related to sustaining activity in support of the company s in-situ and oil sands assets. 
 For the Downstream segment, capital expenditures were primarily for enhancing the company s distribution network as well as refinery projects to improve environmental performance, reliability, feedstock flexibility, and energy efficiency. 
 Total capital and exploration expenditures are expected to be approximately 1.7 billion in 2023. 
 Expected capital and exploration expenditures for 2023 includes firm capital commitments of 407 million for the construction and purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. An additional 211 million of firm capital commitments have been made for years 2024 and beyond. 
 Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects.

Market risks 
 Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. 
 Imperial s earnings are influenced by North American crude oil benchmark prices as well as changes in the differentials between these benchmarks and western Canadian prices for light and heavy crude oil. Imperial s integrated business model reduces the company s risk from changes in commodity prices. For instance, when differentials between North American crude benchmarks and western Canadian prices widen, Imperial is able to mitigate the impact of widening differentials on the Upstream through integration with Downstream investments in refineries, pipeline commitments and the Edmonton rail terminal. 
 In the competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels on products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices, in turn, depend on global and regional supply / demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import / export balances and weather. 
 Industry crude oil commodity prices and petroleum and chemical product prices are commonly benchmarked in U.S. dollars. The majority of Imperial s sales and purchases are related to these industry U.S. dollar benchmarks. As the company records and reports its financial results in Canadian dollars, to the extent that the Canadian / U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, the company s earnings will be affected. 
 Imperial is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its debt which carries floating interest rates. The impact of a quarter percent change in interest rates affecting Imperial s debt would not be material to earnings or cash flow. Imperial has access to significant sources of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt as needed. 
 The company s potential exposure to commodity price and margin, and Canadian / U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations is summarized in the earnings sensitivities table, which shows the estimated annual effect, under current conditions, on the company s after-tax net income. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil and products, production and sales volumes, transportation capacity, costs and egress methods, and other factors. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and crude oil differentials, and other factors listed in the table following, only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period. 

Earnings sensitivities (a)

These sensitivities have been updated to reflect current market conditions. They may not apply proportionately to larger fluctuations. 
 (b) The 2-1-1 crack spread is an indicator of the refining margin generated by converting two barrels of crude oil into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of diesel. 
 
 The demand for crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products are generally linked closely with economic growth. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on the company s financial results. Although price levels of crude oil may rise and fall significantly over the short to medium-term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC, governments and other factors, industry economics over the long-term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. The company evaluates investments over a range of prices, including estimated greenhouse gas emission costs. 
 
 63 

The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the company s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of the company s projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the company s financial strength as a competitive advantage. 
 In general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and / or purchase products to / from other segments. Where such intersegment sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages from integrated business segments and refinery and chemical complexes. The company s intersegment sales include crude oil produced by the Upstream and sold to the Downstream, as well as sales between refineries and the chemical plant related to raw materials, feedstocks and finished products. All intersegment sales are at market based prices. Refer to note 2 for additional information on intersegment revenue. 
 The company has an active asset management program in which nonstrategic assets are considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure that assets are contributing to the company s strategic objectives. 
 
 Risk management 
 The company s size, strong capital structure and the complementary nature of its business segments reduces the company s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. In addition, the company may use commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. The company s derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. Credit risk associated with the company s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. No material market or credit risks to the company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in note 6 on page 94 . The company maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. 
 
 64 

Critical accounting estimates 
 The company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and lower-emission fuels. Imperial does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet. The company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 79 . 
 
 Oil and natural gas reserves 
 Evaluations of oil and natural gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream assets. They are an integral part of investment decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed. 
 The estimation of proved reserve volumes, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures, and development and production costs, and other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserves changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by qualified geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the reserves management group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors. Notably, the company does not use specific quantitative reserves targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserves estimation process are covered in Disclosure of reserves in Item 1. 
 Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. 
 
 Proved oil and natural gas reserves are determined in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. 
 Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells, facilities, or mining activities with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells, existing wells, facilities, or mining activities, where a relatively major capital expenditure is required. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized when a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years, unless specific circumstances support a longer period of time. 
 The company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced. However, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and natural gas price levels. 
 
 Unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 
 Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geologic, reservoir or production data; new geologic, reservoir or production data; or changes in the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity. 
 65 

In 2020, downward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were a result of low prices. The 2.2 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake no longer qualified as proved reserves under the SEC definition of proved reserves. Downward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of lower prices, offset by the addition of proved undeveloped reserves associated with future development at Syncrude. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were the result of updated development plans at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and the divestment of conventional properties. 
 In 2021, upward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were a result of improved prices. The 1.7 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake qualified as proved reserves under the SEC definition of proved reserves. Upward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of improved prices. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were the result of updated development plans and divestments at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 In 2022, downward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were driven by a decrease of 0.2 billion barrels at Kearl as a result of higher royalty obligations associated with pricing, and a decrease of 0.2 billion barrels at Cold Lake due to an updated development plan. An increase to the bitumen reserves of 0.1 billion barrels is associated with extensions at Cold Lake for the Grand Rapids Phase 1 SA-SAGD and Leming SAGD projects. Downward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of mine development plan updates and higher royalty obligations at Syncrude associated with pricing. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were primarily a result of the sale of the company s interest in the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to Imperial. The company s operating decisions and its outlook for future production volumes are not impacted by proved reserves as disclosed under the SEC definition. 
 
 Unit-of-production depreciation 
 Oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to actual production. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some variability. 
 In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the company uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life. 
 To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. This approach was applied in 2021, with the corresponding effect on depreciation expense being immaterial compared to prior periods. For 2022 and 2023, all properties have sufficient reserves at current SEC prices which will enable equitable allocation of cost over the economic lives of the Upstream assets. 

Impact of oil and gas reserves and prices and margins on testing for impairment 
 The company tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The company has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932 and relies, in part, on the company s planning and budgeting cycle. 

66 

Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the company s major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices, industry margins, and development and production costs. Significant reductions in the company s view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360 can be indicators of potential impairment as well. 
 In general, Imperial does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic activities, alternative energy sources and levels of prosperity. During the lifespan of its major assets, the company expects that oil and gas prices and industry margins will experience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the company considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins. 
 Outlook for Energy and cash flow assessment 
 The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the company plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses and people) are allocated across the company. The foundation for the energy supply and demand assumptions supporting the company plan begins with the Outlook, which contains demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. 
 Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world or the company, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and consequently, the company s business plans will be updated accordingly. 
 If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the company plan, which is reviewed and approved by the board of directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the company s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions of applicable provincial and federal governments. While third-party scenarios, such as the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions by 2050 , may be used to test the resiliency of company s businesses or strategies, they are not used as a basis for developing future cash flows for impairment assessments. 
 Fair value of impaired assets 
 An asset group is impaired if its estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based on the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs, and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group. 
 67 

Other impairment estimates 
 Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the company s future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the company expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period. 
 Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Judgment is required to determine if assets are held for sale, and to determine the fair value less cost to sell. 
 Investments accounted for by the equity method are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee s business segment or geographic region. If the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value, which requires significant judgment. 
 Recent impairments 
 In 2020, the company announced its decision to not further develop a significant portion of its unconventional portfolio in Alberta, resulting in a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of 1,171 million in the company s 2020 Upstream results. 
 Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the company s price or margin outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital or development plans, reduced long-term demand for the company s products and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price increases or margins. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices or margins, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the company s long-lived assets. 
 Supplemental information regarding oil and gas results of operations, capitalized costs and reserves is provided following the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Pension benefits 
 The company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third-party actuaries. Pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the discount rate for the benefit obligations, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long-term rate of future compensation increases. All pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management. These assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long-term changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets of 4.3 percent used in 2022 compares to actual returns of 5.6 percent and 6.5 percent achieved over the last 10- and 20-year periods respectively, ending December 31, 2022. If different assumptions are used, the obligation and expense could increase or decrease as a result. As an indication of the company s potential exposure to changes in the critical assumptions such as the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate for measuring the pension plan benefits obligation, a reduction of 1 percent in the discount rate would increase the benefits obligation by approximately 1 billion. Similarly, a reduction of 1 percent in the long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately 95 million before tax. At Imperial, differences between actual returns on plan assets and the long-term expected returns are not recorded in pension expense in the year the differences occur. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected average remaining service life of employees. Employee benefits expense represented about 1 percent of total expenses in 2022. 
 68 

Asset retirement obligations 
 The company is subject to retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the company uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. On page 93 , note 5 to the consolidated financial statements provides a three-year continuity table detailing the changes in asset retirement obligations. 
 
 Suspended exploratory well costs 
 The company continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when it has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Assessing whether the company is making sufficient progress on a project requires careful consideration of the facts and circumstances. The facts and circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements on page 104 . 

Tax contingencies 
 The operations of the company are complex, and related tax interpretations, regulations and legislation are continually changing. 
 The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. The company s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Imperial Oil Limited 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Imperial Oil Limited and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 The Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 
 As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s upstream property, plant and equipment (PP E), net balance was 26,949 million as of December 31, 2022, and the related depreciation and depletion expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,673 million. Management uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. As disclosed by management, proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures, and development and production costs, among other factors. As further disclosed by management, reserves changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by qualified geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the reserves management group (together management s specialists ). 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on upstream PP E, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes, as the reserve volumes are based on engineering assumptions and methods, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. 

72 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for using this work, management s specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with management s specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by management s specialists, tests of the data used by management s specialists, and an evaluation of management s specialists findings.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of Imperial Oil Limited. 
 The company s principal business involves exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals and a variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and lower-emission fuels. 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Prior years data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2022 presentation basis. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.

years and years respectively. Depreciation of other plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated service life of the asset. 
 To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. This approach was applied in 2021, with the corresponding effect on depreciation expense being immaterial compared to prior periods. For 2022 and 2023, all properties have sufficient reserves at current SEC prices which will enable equitable allocation of cost over the economic lives of the Upstream assets. 
 Investments in refinery and chemical process manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a -year life. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.

 The unrecognized tax benefit balances shown above are predominately related to tax positions that would reduce the company s effective tax rate if the positions are favourably resolved. Unfavourable resolution of these tax positions generally would not increase the effective tax rate. The 2022, 2021 and 2020 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the company s net income or cash flow. The company s tax filings from 2018 to 2022 are subject to examination by the tax authorities. Tax filings from 2007 to 2017 have open objections and therefore are also subject to examination by the tax authorities. The Canada Revenue Agency has made certain adjustments to the company s filings. Management has evaluated these adjustments and is formally disputing those matters to which the company disagrees. Many of these outstanding matters will not be resolved until after 2023. The impact on unrecognized tax benefits and the company s effective income tax rate from these matters is not expected to be material. 
 Resolution of the related tax positions could take many years to complete. It is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not entirely within the control of the company. 
 The company classifies interest on income tax related balances as interest expense or interest income and classifies tax related penalties as operating expense.

 The company establishes the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets by developing a forward-looking long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. The 2022 long-term expected return of percent used in the calculations of pension expense compares to an actual rate of return of percent and percent over the last 10- and 20-year periods respectively, ending December 31, 2022.

 The company s investment strategy for pension plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in plan assets and liabilities and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. The pension plan assets are primarily invested in passive global equity and domestic fixed income index funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The fixed income funds are largely invested in investment grade corporate and government debt securities with interest rate sensitivity designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of plan liabilities. The target asset allocation for the pension plan is reviewed periodically and set based on considerations such as risk, diversification and liquidity. The target asset allocation for equity securities is percent with the remainder in fixed-income securities. 
 The fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.

 Derivative instruments 
 The company s size, strong capital structure and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the company s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. In addition, the company uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated statement of income on a net basis in the line Revenues . The company does not designate derivative instruments as a hedge for hedge accounting purposes. 
 Credit risk associated with the company s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The company maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

As a result of an employee stock program expansion implemented in 2022, some new participants will be eligible for awards granted that vest percent after . The company may also issue units to the chairman, president and chief executive officer where percent of the units vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vest on the tenth anniversary of the grant date, except that for awards granted prior to 2020, the vesting of the tenth anniversary portion is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years. 
 The deferred share unit plan is made available to nonemployee directors. The nonemployee directors can elect to receive all or part of their eligible directors fees in units. The number of units granted is determined at the end of each calendar quarter by dividing the dollar amount of the nonemployee director s fees for that calendar quarter elected to be received as deferred share units by the average closing price of the company s shares for the five consecutive trading days average closing price immediately prior to the last day of the calendar quarter. Additional units are granted to represent dividends on unexercised units, and are calculated by dividing the cash dividend payable on the company s shares by the average closing price immediately prior to the payment date for that dividend and multiplying the resulting number by the number of deferred share units held by the recipient, as adjusted for any share splits. Deferred share units cannot be exercised until after termination of service as a director, including termination due to death, and must be exercised in their entirety in one election no later than December 31 of the year following the year of termination of service. On the exercise date, the cash value to be received for the units is determined based on the company s average closing price immediately prior to the date of exercise, as adjusted for any share splits. 
 All units require settlement by cash payments with the following exceptions. The restricted stock unit program provides that, for units granted to Canadian residents, the recipient may receive one common share of the company per unit or elect to receive the cash payment for the units that vest on the seventh year anniversary of the grant date. For units where percent vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vest on the tenth anniversary of grant, the recipient may receive one common share of the company per unit or elect to receive cash payment for all that vest. 
 The company accounts for all units by using the fair-value-based method. The fair value of awards in the form of restricted stock and deferred share units is the market price of the company s stock. Under this method, compensation expense related to the units of these programs is measured each reporting period based on the company s current stock price and is recorded in the Consolidated statement of income over the requisite service period of each award.

Standardized measure of discounted future cash flows 
 As required by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices, year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and remediation obligations. The company believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the company s expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions, including first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change.

 The information above describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2020, 2021 and 2022. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. 
 Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and other facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves. 
 
 109 

In accordance with SEC rules, the year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the proved reserves tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities were also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow. 
 Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of already available geologic, reservoir or production data; new geologic, reservoir or production data; or changes in the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity. 
 
 In 2020, downward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were a result of low prices. The 2.2 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake no longer qualified as proved reserves under the SEC definition of proved reserves. Downward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of lower prices, offset by the addition of proved undeveloped reserves associated with future development at Syncrude. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were the result of updated development plans at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and the divestment of conventional properties. 
 In 2021, upward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were a result of improved prices. The 1.7 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake qualified as proved reserves under the SEC definition of proved reserves. Upward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of improved prices. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were the result of updated development plans and divestments at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 In 2022, downward revisions of proved bitumen reserves were driven by a decrease of 0.2 billion barrels at Kearl as a result of higher royalty obligations associated with pricing, and a decrease of 0.2 billion barrels at Cold Lake due to an updated development plan. An increase to the bitumen reserves of 0.1 billion barrels is associated with extensions at Cold Lake for the Grand Rapids Phase 1 SA-SAGD and Leming SAGD projects. Downward revisions to proved synthetic crude oil reserves were a result of mine development plan updates and higher royalty obligations at Syncrude associated with pricing. Changes to the liquids and natural gas proved reserves were primarily a result of the sale of the company s interest in the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to Imperial. The company s operating decisions and its outlook for future production volumes are not impacted by proved reserves as disclosed under the SEC definition. 
 Net proved reserves are determined by deducting the estimated future share of mineral owners or governments or both. For liquids and natural gas, net proved reserves are based on estimated future royalty rates as of the date the estimate is made incorporating the applicable governments oil and gas royalty regimes. For bitumen, net proved reserves are based on the company s best estimate of average royalty rates over the remaining life of each of the Cold Lake and Kearl fields, and they incorporate the Alberta government s oil sands royalty regime. For synthetic crude oil, net proved reserves are based on the company s best estimate of average royalty rates over the remaining life of the project, and they incorporate the Alberta government s oil sands royalty regime. In all cases, actual future royalty rates may vary with production, price and costs. 
 Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells, facilities, or mining activities with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well or facility. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered as a result of future investments to drill new wells, to recomplete existing wells and / or to install facilities to collect and deliver the production from existing and future wells, facilities, or mining activities.

These amendments provide for the election of a director only if the number of for votes represents a majority of the votes cast both for and against the director. Following the implementation of these amendments, the company s existing majority voting policy was rendered redundant and was revoked by the board.

 Composition of our board nominees 

More information on diversity, including on the board and among executive officers of the company, can be found at page 148 . 
 
 119 

Tenure of our board nominees 
 The board charter provides that incumbent directors will not be re-nominated if they have attained the age of 72, except under exceptional circumstances and at the request of the chairman. The company does not have term limits for independent directors because it values the comprehensive knowledge of the company that long serving directors possess and independent directors are expected to remain qualified to serve for a minimum of five years. 
 
 K.T. Hoeg, J.M. Mintz and D.S. Sutherland are not standing for re-election in 2023 as they have reached the company s mandatory retirement age for directors. In anticipation of these retirements, the board undertook an extensive director recruitment process resulting in S.R. Driscoll, J. Floren and G.J. Goldberg being nominated for election to the board for the first time. 
 
 The following chart shows the current years of service of the nominees for the board of directors and the year they would normally be expected to retire from the board.

 Our directors bring a wide range of skills, diversity and experience. 
 
 The current directors and director nominees collectively have the experience and expertise required to ensure effective oversight, stewardship and governance of the company. The key areas of experience and skills for each of the nominees for election as directors can also be found in each of the nominees tables on pages 112 through 116 of this circular. 
 The table below sets out the diverse skill set required of the board and identifies the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each director and nominee that led the board to conclude that such person should serve as a director of the company.

 121 

Independence of our board members and nominees 

Five out of seven of the director nominees are independent. 

The board is currently composed of seven directors, four of whom will be standing for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders on May 2, 2023. K.T. Hoeg, J.M. Mintz and D.S. Sutherland will not stand for re-election in 2023 as they have reached the company's mandatory retirement age for directors. S.R. Driscoll, J. Floren and G.J. Goldberg are being nominated for election as directors at the annual meeting of shareholders and are not currently directors . The majority of the board and nominees (five out of seven) are independent. The independent directors and nominees are not employees of the company. 
 The board determines independence on the basis of the standards specified by National Instrument 52-110 Audit Committees (NI 52-110) , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the listing standards of the NYSE American LLC. The board has reviewed relevant relationships between the company and each nonemployee director and director nominee to determine compliance with these standards. 
 Based on the directors responses to an annual questionnaire, the board determined that none of the independent directors has any interest, business or other relationship that could or could reasonably be perceived to constitute a material relationship with the company. B.W. Corson is a director and chairman, president and chief executive officer of the company and not considered to be independent. The board believes that Mr. Corson s extensive knowledge of the business of the company and Exxon Mobil Corporation is beneficial to the other directors and his participation enhances the effectiveness of the board. 
 M.R. Crocker is also a non-independent director as he is an employee of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The company believes that Mr. Crocker, although deemed non-independent under the relevant standards by virtue of his employment, can be viewed as independent of the company s management and that his ability to reflect the perspective of the company s shareholders enhances the effectiveness of the board.

The special committees were chaired by D.W. Cornhill and consisted of the five independent directors. 
 
 Number of meetings 
 The chart below shows the number of board and standing committee meetings held in 2022. This includes seven regular meetings and one additional special meeting of the board.

Director qualification and selection process 
 The nominations and corporate governance committee is responsible for identifying and recommending new candidates for board nomination. The committee identifies candidates from a number of sources, including executive search firms and referrals from existing directors. The process for selection is described in paragraph 10 (a) of the Board of Directors Charter found in Appendix A of this circular. The committee will consider potential future candidates as required. 
 In considering the qualifications of potential nominees for election as directors, the nominations and corporate governance committee considers the work experience and other areas of expertise of the potential nominees, with the objective of providing for diversity among the nonemployee directors. The following key criteria are considered to be relevant to the work of the board of directors and its committees: 
 Work experience 
 Experience in leadership of businesses or other large organizations (Leadership of large organizations) 
 Operations/technical experience (Operations / technical) 
 Project management experience (Project management) 
 Experience in working in a global work environment (Global experience) 
 Experience in development of business strategy (Strategy development) 
 Experience with environmental, health, community relations and/or safety policy, practices and management (Environment and sustainability) 
 Other expertise 
 Audit committee financial expert (also see the financial expert section in the audit committee table starting on page 134 
 Expertise in financial matters (Financial expertise) 
 Expertise in managing relations with government (Government relations) 
 Expertise in information technology and cybersecurity oversight (Information technology / cybersecurity oversight) 
 Expertise in executive compensation policies and practices (Executive compensation) 
 Expertise in oversight of risk management policies and practices (Risk management) 
 The nominations and corporate governance committee may consider the following additional factors in assessing potential nominees: 
 possessing expertise in any of the following areas: law, science, marketing, administration, social/political environment or community and civic affairs; 
 individual competencies in business and other areas of endeavour in contributing to the collective experience of the directors; and 
 providing diversity of age, regional association, gender and other diversity elements (including Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities). 
 The nominations and corporate governance committee assesses the work experience and other expertise each existing director possesses and whether the candidate is able to fill any gaps in such experience, expertise and diversity of age, regional association, gender and other diversity elements. More detailed information on diversity of the board, including in connection with the director recruitment process in 2022, can be found at page 148 . Consideration is also given to whether candidates possess the ability to contribute to the broad range of issues with which the board and its committees must deal, are able to devote the necessary amount of time to prepare for and attend board and committee meetings and are free of any potential legal impediment or conflict of interest. 
 Candidates are expected to remain qualified to serve for a minimum of five years and independent directors are expected to achieve ownership of no less than 16,500 common shares, deferred share units and restricted share units within five years of becoming an independent director. 
 When the committee is recommending candidates for re-nomination, it assesses such candidates against the criteria for re-nomination as set out in paragraph 10 (b) of the Board of Directors Charter found in Appendix A of this circular. Candidates for re-nomination are expected not to change their principal position, the thrust of their involvement or their regional association in a way that would significantly detract from their value as a director of the corporation. They are also expected to continue to be compatible with the criteria that led to their selection as nominees. Under exceptional circumstances, the nominations and corporate governance committee, on the 
 126 

request of the chairman, may continue to support the nomination of a director who has attained the mandatory retirement age. 
 In anticipation of K.T. Hoeg, J.M. Mintz and D.S. Sutherland reaching mandatory retirement age, the board and nominations and corporate governance committee began an extensive director recruitment process in 2021, including engaging executive search firms to cultivate a diverse selection of potential nominees. The board reviewed the recruitment process on a regular basis, including discussing numerous candidates, conducting extensive interviews and ensuring that all board members had the opportunity to meet the candidates to ensure a strong fit for the board. This process has resulted in three new nominees for the 2023 annual meeting, S.R. Driscoll, J. Floren and G.J. Goldberg, to replace Ms. Hoeg, Mr. Mintz and Mr. Sutherland upon their retirement. 
 Ms. Driscoll brings extensive chief financial officer, chief executive officer and board experience through various roles at Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated, service as a director of Empire Company Limited and other corporate experience. Mr. Floren is the former president and chief executive officer of Methanex Corporation, with over 37 years experience in the chemicals industry and currently serving on the board of West Fraser Timber Co. Mr. Goldberg has more than 35 years of global experience including substantial chief executive officer experience in the mining industry, has served on various mining industry councils and organizations and is currently a nonemployee director of BHP Group Limited. The board is pleased to welcome these highly experienced and successful individuals as nominees, and looks forward to their leadership and oversight for the company. 
 
 Director orientation, education and development 

The company regularly provides in-depth presentations to the directors on relevant 
 and emerging issues and encourages continuing education opportunities. 

The corporate secretary organizes an orientation program for all new directors. In a series of meetings over several days, new directors are briefed by staff and functional managers on all significant areas of the company s operations, industry specific topics, risk oversight and regulatory issues. New directors are also briefed on significant company policies, organizational structure, security, information technology management and on critical planning and reserves processes. They also receive key governance and disclosure documents and a comprehensive board manual which contains a record of historical information about the company, by-laws, company policies, the charters of the board and its committees, other relevant company business information, information on directors duties and additional board related activities and calendars. With S.R. Driscoll, J. Floren and G.J. Goldberg being nominated for election for the first time this year, the corporate secretary plans to commence an extensive orientation program shortly after their election to the board. 
 Continuing education is provided to board and committee members through regular presentations by management, which focus on providing more in-depth information about key aspects of the business. Subject to exceptional circumstances, each year the board has an extended meeting that focuses on a particular area of the company s operations and includes a visit to one or more of the company s operating sites or a site of relevance. These site visits help directors better understand the strengths and business opportunities unique to various operations and markets across the country, and enhance the board s perspective of the integrated nature of the company s business. In September 2022, the board visited the Sarnia refinery, chemical plant and research centre for a tour of the facilities and presentations specific to the operations and research at Sarnia. 
 Throughout 2022, the board and its committees received regular presentations and updates that focused on performance, strategy and opportunities for the business. Some of these presentations included ongoing reviews of upstream and downstream performance, plans and strategies, internal audit reviews, a pension management review, a review of harassment in workplace policy stewardship, community engagement strategy, litigation reviews, conflict of interest and ethics reviews and a competition and anti-corruption review. Recognizing the importance of cybersecurity oversight for the company, the board was also provided an information technology and cybersecurity update including strategic cybersecurity priorities, key security initiatives and mitigation efforts and system improvements throughout the year. The board continued to engage with management on pandemic specific topics throughout 2022, such as response and mitigation plans and actions, health and safety initiatives, strategic business actions and the company s response to the gradual lessening of restrictions across Canada over the year. 
 
 127 

With strong market conditions and business performance throughout the year, the board focused on strategic direction, operational priorities, capital allocation and prioritizing shareholder returns. This included reviews and approval of the acceleration of the company's normal course issuer bid and the completion of two substantial issuer bids during the year, as well as the sale of the company s interests in XTO Energy Canada with proceeds used to reduce the company s outstanding debt. 
 The board also reviewed and discussed the company s various environmental, social and governance initiatives throughout the year, including the publication of the company s advancing climate solutions and sustainability reports. There was a continued focus by the board on the company s progress with emissions reduction initiatives, including the company s founding membership in the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative and setting and tracking emissions reduction goals. The board also undertook reviews of disclosure and emissions performance, safety performance and Canada climate policy updates. More information on the board s role in relation to the environment can be found in the Risk oversight section starting on page 130 . 
 Members of ExxonMobil s management also provide reviews of various aspects of ExxonMobil s global business. In 2022, the directors received a presentation on ExxonMobil s cybersecurity update, as well as an overview of ExxonMobil s corporate strategy and the ExxonMobil Outlook for Energy. 
 Members of the board receive an extensive package of materials prior to each board meeting that provides a comprehensive summary on each agenda item to be discussed. Similarly, the committee members also receive a comprehensive summary on each agenda item to be discussed by that particular committee. Informational communications and other written publications or reports of interest to the directors are also forwarded routinely. 
 The board members are canvassed as to whether there are any additional topics relevant to the board or to a specific committee that they would like to see addressed, and management schedules presentations covering these areas. In addition, at every meeting the board receives an extensive update from the chairman, president and chief executive officer on business environment trends, relevant geopolitical activities, federal government priorities, key provincial issues and competitor activities, as appropriate. Directors are encouraged to participate in other continuing education programs and events to ensure their skills and knowledge remain current. 
 
 Board performance assessment 
 The board and its committees, as well as the performance of the directors, are assessed on an annual basis. For 2022, the directors engaged in a performance assessment with the chairman, president and chief executive officer, which includes discussion and evaluation of the board and each committee s effectiveness in various areas. The chairman, president and chief executive officer also meets regularly with directors individually to discuss any outstanding issues. The nominations and corporate governance committee discuss a summary of these assessment outcomes in the first quarter of each year. 
 
 Board and committee structure 
 Leadership structure 
 The company has chosen to combine the positions of chairman, president and chief executive officer. The board believes the interests of all shareholders are best served at the present time through a leadership model with a combined chairman and chief executive officer position. Through more than 39 years of experience with ExxonMobil and Imperial, the current chief executive officer possesses an in-depth knowledge of the evolving energy industry supply and demand fundamentals and the array of challenges to be faced by the company. The board believes that the extensive experience and other insights put the chief executive officer in the best position to provide broad leadership for the board as it considers strategy and exercises its fiduciary responsibilities. Further, the board has demonstrated its commitment and ability to provide independent oversight of management. 
 The company does not have a lead director. While the chairman of the board is not an independent director, K.T. Hoeg, chair of the executive sessions of the board, provides leadership for the independent directors. The duties of the chair of the executive sessions include presiding at executive sessions, reviewing and modifying, if necessary, the agenda of the meetings of the board in advance to ensure that the board may successfully carry out its duties, and acting as a liaison with the chairman of the board, including the provision of feedback, as appropriate, from the executive sessions. The position description of the chair of the executive sessions, as well as the purpose of those executive sessions, are fully described in paragraphs 9 (c) and (d) of the Board of Directors Charter attached as Appendix A. 
 128 

Independent director executive sessions 
 The executive sessions of the board are in camera meetings of the independent directors and are held in conjunction with every board meeting. These meetings are held in the absence of management. The independent directors held eight executive sessions in 2022. The purposes of the executive sessions of the board include the following: 
 
 raising substantive issues that are more appropriately discussed in the absence of management; 
 
 discussing the need to communicate to the chairman of the board any matter of concern raised by any committee or director; 
 
 addressing issues raised but not resolved at meetings of the board and assessing any follow-up needs with the chairman of the board; 
 
 discussing the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of information from management that is necessary for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and advising the chairman of the board of any changes required; and 
 
 seeking feedback about board processes. 
 
 In camera sessions of the board committees 
 Various committees also regularly hold in camera sessions without management present. The audit committee regularly holds private sessions of the committee members as well as private meetings of the committee with each of the external auditor, the internal auditor and senior management as part of every regularly scheduled committee meeting. 
 Committee structure 
 The board has created five standing committees to help carry out its duties. Each committee is chaired by a different independent director and all of the independent directors are members of each committee. M.R. Crocker is also a member of each committee, with the exception of the audit committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors. B.W. Corson is also a member of the community collaboration and engagement committee. In 2023, the name of the public policy and corporate responsibility committee was changed to the safety and sustainability committee. 

Board committees work on key issues in greater detail than would be possible at full board meetings, allowing directors to more effectively discharge their stewardship responsibilities. The independent chairs of the five committees are able to take a leadership role in executing the board s responsibility with respect to a specific area of the company s operations falling within the responsibility of the committee he or she chairs. The board and each committee have a written charter that can be found in Appendix A of this circular. The charters set out the purpose, structure, position description for the chair, and the responsibility and authority of that committee, and are reviewed and approved by the board annually. 
 In addition to its standing committees, the board may establish ad hoc committees or special committees from time to time. 

129 

Risk oversight 
 The company is governed by a comprehensive and well-established risk management system, and the company s success in managing risk over time has been achieved through emphasis on execution of this disciplined management framework. 

The company s risk management system includes a process for identifying, prioritizing, measuring, and managing the principal risks across the company, as well as assessing the company s response to these risks. The system is implemented at multiple levels of the business through various policies, guidelines, processes and systems, including: 
 energy outlook scenarios; 
 strategic planning; 
 risk management guidelines; 
 code of ethics and standards of business conduct; 
 delegation of authority guidelines; 
 credit risk assessment guidelines; 
 controls and operations integrity management systems; 
 capital project management systems; 
 IT risk management (including information technology, systems and cybersecurity); 
 guidelines for the management and protection of information; and 
 business continuity plans. 
 For a discussion on the company s risk management in relation to executive compensation, see the Compensation discussion and analysis section starting on page 156 . 
 
 130 

The chairman, president and chief executive officer is charged with identifying the company s principal risks and ensuring appropriate systems are in place to manage these risks. The board of directors is responsible for reviewing the principal risks and overseeing the implementation of the risk management system, with the various committees assisting in risk oversight for issues that fall under their responsibility. This integrated risk management approach facilitates recognition and oversight of risk. For example, the audit committee oversees the company s system of internal accounting and financial controls, and the executive resources committee oversees the compensation programs and practices in relation to risk management. 
 The safety and sustainability committee oversees the policies and practices that manage environment, health, safety and security risk. This includes reviews of compliance with legislation and the assessment of public policy impacts on corporate performance, health and safety systems and performance, and the risks, actions and disclosure associated with climate change and the energy transition. As part of this assessment, the committee reviews the company s commitments to environmental sustainability priorities such as progressive reclamation, decommissioning and remediation, water conservation and use, air quality improvement, waste management and land use and biodiversity. Additionally, the committee and board provides oversight over the company's emission reduction goals, including the company's announcement in 2022 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity (Scope 1, 2) for its operated oil sands facilities by 30 percent by 2030 relative to 2016 levels. As part of the company s efforts to provide solutions that lower the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of its operations and to provide lower life-cycle emission products to its customers, Imperial has also implemented a company-wide goal to achieve net-zero emissions (Scope 1, 2) by 2050 in its operated assets through collaboration with government and other industry partners. The board of directors evaluates climate change risk in the context of overall enterprise risk, including other operational, strategic, and financial risks. Imperial's board is actively engaged and committed to overseeing the company's efforts as it pursues a strategy that is resilient to a wide range of potential pathways for society s energy transition while continuing to grow shareholder value. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and market conditions within the energy industry starting in 2020 has placed a significant emphasis on the board s role in risk oversight. Throughout 2022, the board remained fully engaged on the company s business and emergency response plans, health and safety protocols, market conditions and the company s response to the gradual lessening of restrictions across Canada over the year.

The board and its committees carry out their risk oversight responsibility through regular reviews and assessments. Topic-specific assessments, such as for compliance programs, controls, stewardship of business performance, regulatory changes, the company s energy outlook, and climate risk and sustainability are conducted regularly and as necessary. The board carefully considers various factors and risks in connection with specific proposals for capital expenditures, budget additions and strategic initiatives, as well as in evaluating strategic plans. Members of the board ask questions of management to ensure risks are identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored. Each typical year, the board also visits one or more of the company s operating sites or locations of importance for the company to better understand issues associated with the company s business. 
 In the annual planning process, consideration is given to a diverse set of risks and other factors that may influence future energy supply and demand trends, including technological advancements, regulation and government policies, climate change, greenhouse gas restrictions, and other general economic conditions. It also takes into account emerging industry and economic conditions and market and government policy uncertainties in developing its strategic plans and longer-term price views. Further, the board is responsible for ensuring the company s strategic planning process is effective, and in doing so regularly reviews the process, key issues and various alternatives for future strategy development to inform updates. Business plans and strategies are reviewed on an annual basis and approved by the board. 
 The tables on the following pages provides additional oversight and other information about the board and its five standing committees:

Director compensation 
 Director compensation discussion and analysis 

Directors compensation is intended to align the long-term 
 financial interests of the directors with those of the shareholders. 

Nonemployee director compensation levels are reviewed by the nominations and corporate governance committee each year, and resulting recommendations are presented to the full board for approval. The committee relied on an internally-led assessment to provide competitive compensation and market data for directors compensation, which assisted the committee in making a compensation recommendation for the company s directors. The internally-led assessment included a review of industry survey data, with this data being provided by an independent external consultant. The internal assessment maintained the compensation design philosophy, objectives and principles, and was consistent with previous methodology used in this analysis. 
 Employees of the company or Exxon Mobil Corporation receive no extra pay for serving as directors. Nonemployee directors receive compensation consisting of cash and restricted stock units. Since 1999, the nonemployee directors have been able to receive all or part of their cash directors fees in the form of deferred share units. The purpose of the deferred share unit plan for nonemployee directors is to provide them with additional motivation to promote sustained improvement in the company s business performance and shareholder value by allowing them to have all or part of their directors fees tied to the future growth in value of the company s common shares. The deferred share unit plan is described in more detail on page 141 . 

139 

Compensation decision making process and considerations 
 The nominations and corporate governance committee relies on market comparisons with a group of major Canadian companies with national and international scope and complexity. The company draws its nonemployee directors from a wide variety of industrial sectors and, as such, a broad sample is appropriate for this purpose. The nominations and corporate governance committee does not target any specific percentile among comparator companies at which to align compensation for this group. 
 The comparator companies included in the benchmark sample are as follows: 
 
 Energy 
 Non-energy 
 Canadian Natural Resources Limited 
 Air Canada 
 Cenovus Energy Inc. 
 Bank of Nova Scotia 
 Enbridge Inc. 
 BCE Inc. Ovintiv Inc. 
 Canadian National Railway Company Parkland Fuel Corporation 
 Nutrien Ltd. Suncor Energy Inc. 
 Royal Bank of Canada TC Energy Corporation 
 Sun Life Financial Inc. Teck Resources Limited 
 TELUS Corporation 
 Thomson Reuters Corporation 
 The Toronto-Dominion Bank 
 
 Hedging policy 
 Company policy prohibits all employees, including executives, and directors, from being a party to derivative or similar financial instruments, including puts, calls, or other options, future or forward contracts, or equity swaps or collars, with respect to the company or Exxon Mobil Corporation stock. 
 For a discussion on the process by which the compensation of the company s executive officers is determined, see the Compensation discussion and analysis section starting on page 156 . 
 Compensation details 
 Board retainer 
 The compensation of the nonemployee directors is assessed annually, and currently consists of a cash retainer for board membership and a grant of restricted stock units. 
 In 2021, the nominations and corporate governance committee reviewed and recommended a change to the annual grant of restricted stock units, increasing the grant from 3,000 to 3,300, with the annual retainer for board membership remaining at 110,000 per year. The board subsequently approved this recommendation. During 2022, the committee recommended and the board approved no changes to nonemployee director compensation. 
 
 140 

The following table summarizes the compensation terms for the nonemployee directors in 2022: 
 
 Director compensation Annual retainer terms: (a) Cash retainer: Board membership 110,000 annually 
 Committee chair None Equity based compensation: Restricted stock units 3,300 units 
 (50 vests on each of the 5 th and 10 th anniversary dates of the grant) 

(a) The nonemployee directors may elect to take all or a portion of the cash retainer in the form of deferred share units. Nonemployee directors who are appointed to the board during any given year receive the full restricted stock unit grant and a prorated cash retainer based on the date of appointment. 
 In addition to compensation for board membership, the board determines the compensation for special committee membership when the committee is established. For the special committee established in September, 2021, the board approved a 2022 cash retainer of 15,000 for the chair and 10,000 for members. There was no cash retainer in connection with the special committee established in September, 2022. 
 Equity based compensation 
 Deferred share units 
 In 1999, an additional form of long-term incentive compensation deferred share units was made available to nonemployee directors. Nonemployee directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of deferred share units. 
 The following table shows the portion of the retainer each nonemployee director elected to receive in cash and deferred share units in 2022.

 D.W. Cornhill 0 100 K.T. Hoeg 0 100 M.C. Hubbs 0 100 J.M. Mintz 50 50 D.S. Sutherland 0 100 
 The number of deferred share units granted to a nonemployee director is determined at the end of each calendar quarter for that year, according to the following calculation: 
 (i) the dollar amount of the nonemployee director s fees for that calendar quarter that the director elected to receive as deferred share units; 
 divided by 
 (ii) the average of the closing price of the company s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the five consecutive trading days average closing price immediately prior to the last day of that calendar quarter. 
 
 Those deferred share units are granted effective the last day of that calendar quarter. 
 
 141 

A nonemployee director is also granted additional deferred share units to represent dividends on unexercised deferred share units. These additional units are granted on the dividend payment dates for the company s common shares, according to the following calculation: 
 (i) the cash dividend payable for a common share of the company divided by the average closing price immediately prior to the payment date for that dividend; 
 multiplied by 
 (ii) the number of unexercised deferred share units held by the nonemployee directors on the dividend record date. 
 A nonemployee director may only exercise deferred share units by the end of the calendar year following the year of termination of service as a director of the company, including termination of service due to death. No deferred share units may be exercised unless all of the deferred share units are exercised on the same date. On the exercise date, the cash value to be received for the units is determined based on the company s average closing price immediately prior to the date of exercise. 
 Restricted stock units 
 In addition to the cash fees described above, the company pays a significant portion of director compensation in restricted stock units to align director compensation with the long-term interests of shareholders. The restricted stock unit plan is described in more detail beginning on page 163 . 
 The number of restricted stock units granted annually was increased in 2016 from 2,000 units to 2,600 units, in 2018 to 3,000 units, and in 2021 to 3,300 units. Up until 2015, the vesting period for restricted stock units was 50 percent vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date (received in cash) and the remaining 50 percent vesting on the seventh anniversary of the grant date (with an option to receive in cash or common shares). In 2016, in order to better align the long-term financial interests of the directors with those of the shareholders, the vesting period was increased such that 50 percent vests on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50 percent vests on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. For all the units to be vested, directors may elect to receive one common share for each unit or a cash payment for the units. The vesting periods are not accelerated upon separation or retirement from the board, except in the event of death. 
 In contrast to the forfeiture provisions for restricted stock units held by employees of the company, the restricted stock units awarded to nonemployee directors are not subject to risk of forfeiture at the time a director leaves the company s board. This provision is designed to reinforce the independence of these board members. However, while on the board and for a 24-month period after leaving the company s board, restricted stock units may be forfeited if the nonemployee director engages in direct competition with the company or otherwise engages in any activity detrimental to the company. The board agreed that the word detrimental shall not include any actions taken by a nonemployee director or former nonemployee director who acted in good faith and in the best interest of the company. 
 Prior to vesting of the restricted stock units, the nonemployee directors receive amounts equivalent to the cash dividends paid to holders of common shares. The amount is determined for each cash dividend payment date by the following calculation: 
 (i) the cash dividend payable for a common share divided by the average closing price immediately prior to the payment date for that dividend; 
 multiplied by 
 (ii) the number of unvested restricted stock units held by the nonemployee directors on the dividend record date. 
 Other reimbursement 
 Nonemployee directors are also reimbursed for travel and other expenses incurred for attendance at board and committee meetings.

Share ownership guidelines of independent directors and chairman, president and chief executive officer 
 Independent directors are required to hold the equivalent of at least 16,500 shares of Imperial Oil Limited, including common shares, deferred share units and restricted stock units within five years from the date of appointment to the board. 
 The chairman, president and chief executive officer has separate share ownership requirements and must, within three years of his appointment, acquire shares of the company, including common shares and restricted stock units, of a value of no less than five times his base salary. 
 The board of directors believes that these share ownership guidelines will result in an alignment of the interests of board members with the interests of all other shareholders. As of the date of this circular, the independent directors currently have holdings of 335,484 shares which is more than three times the required guideline.

Ethical business conduct 
 
 The company is committed to high ethical standards through its policies and practices. 
 
 The company s directors, officers and employees are responsible for developing, approving and implementing plans and actions designed to achieve corporate objectives. In doing so, they are expected to observe the highest standards of integrity in the conduct of the company s business, with the methods employed to attain results being as important as the results themselves. 
 The board has adopted a written code of ethics and business conduct (the Code which can be found on the company s website at www.imperialoil.ca/en-CA/Investors/Investor-relations , including any applicable amendments. The Code applies to each of the company s directors, officers and employees, and consists of the ethics policy, the conflicts of interest policy, the corporate assets policy, the directorships policy and the procedures and open door communication. No person in the company has the authority to make exceptions or grant waivers with respect to its foundational policies. There have been no material change reports filed in the past 12 months pertaining to conduct of a director or executive officer that constitute a departure from the Code. In addition, the directors of the company must comply with the conflict of interest provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act, as well as the relevant securities regulatory instruments, in order to ensure that the directors exercise independent judgment in considering transactions and agreements in respect of which such director has a material interest. 
 Under the company s procedures and open door communication, employees are encouraged and expected to refer suspected violations of the law, company policy or internal controls and procedures by various means, including to their supervisors or the company s ethics advisor, controller or general auditor. Imperial also has an ethics hotline that is operated by a third-party service provider and offers confidential, anonymous reporting 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Suspected violations involving a director or executive officer, as well as any concern regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters are to be referred directly to the internal auditor. The audit committee initially reviews all issues involving directors or executive officers, and then refers all issues to the board of directors. In the alternative, employees may also address concerns to individual nonemployee directors or to nonemployee directors as a group. No action may be taken or threatened against employees for asking questions, voicing concerns, or making complaints or suggestions in good faith. 
 Management provides the board of directors with a review of corporate ethics and conflicts of interest on an annual basis. The company s internal auditors audit each business line s compliance with the program and report to the audit committee. Directors, officers and employees review the company s standards of business conduct (which includes the Code) on an annual basis, with independent directors and all employees being required to sign a declaration confirming that they have read and are familiar with the standards of business conduct. In addition, every four years a business practices review is conducted in which managers review the standards of business conduct with all employees in their respective work units. 
 The board, through its audit committee, examines the effectiveness of the company s internal control processes and management information systems. The board consults with the external auditor, the internal auditor and the management of the company to ensure the integrity of the systems. 
 There are a number of structures and processes in place to facilitate the functioning of the board independently of management. The board has a majority of independent directors. Each committee is chaired by a different independent director and all of the independent directors are members of each committee. The audit committee is composed entirely of independent directors. Each other committee (except the community collaboration and engagement committee) is composed entirely of the independent directors and M.R. Crocker, who is an employee of Exxon Mobil Corporation and although deemed non-independent under the relevant standards by virtue of his employment, is viewed as independent of the company s management. The agendas of each of the board and its committees are not set by management alone, but by the board as a whole and by each committee. A significant number of agenda items are mandatory and recurring. Board meetings are scheduled at least one full year in advance. Any director may call a meeting of the board or a meeting of a committee of which the director is a member. There is a board-prescribed flow of financial, operating and other corporate information to all directors. The board may also utilize ad hoc or special committees when considering various matters. 
 147 

The independent directors conduct executive sessions in the absence of members of management. These meetings are chaired by K.T. Hoeg, the independent director designated by the independent directors to chair and lead these discussions. Eight executive sessions were held in 2022. 
 The company s delegation of authority guide provides that certain matters of the company are reviewed by functional contacts within ExxonMobil. The company s employees are regularly reminded that they are expected to act in the best interests of the company, and are reminded of their obligation to identify any instances where the company s general interest may not be consistent with ExxonMobil s priorities. If such situations occur, employees are expected to escalate such issues with successive levels of the company s management. Final resolution of any such issues is made by the company s chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
 
 Restrictions on insider trading 
 
 Commitment to stringent safeguards with trading restrictions and reporting for company insiders. 
 
 Structures and processes are in place to caution, track and monitor reporting insiders, nonemployee directors and key employees with access to sensitive information with respect to personal trading in the company s shares. The company has guidelines regarding insider trading prohibitions and trading bans that are applicable to all directors, officers and employees. 
 Nonemployee directors are required to pre-clear any trades in the company s shares. Reporting insiders are required to give advance notice to the company of any sale of the company s shares and advise the company within five days of any purchase of the company s shares. Reporting insiders are required, under securities regulations, to publically disclose all transactions in the company s shares on the System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI). 
 From time to time, the company advises its directors and officers, and those of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and employees in certain positions not to trade in the company s shares. Trading bans occur in connection with the directors pending consideration of the financial statements of the company, including the unaudited financial statements for each quarter, and in connection with undisclosed pending events that constitute material information about the business affairs of the company. 

Diversity 
 
 The company has a long history of valuing diversity on the board and in its executive management. 
 
 Board diversity 
 The company has a longstanding commitment to diversity amongst its directors. Imperial has had at least one woman on its board continuously since 1977, and 40 percent of the independent directors of the current board and nominees for election at the annual meeting are women. 
 
 The company does not have a formal written policy relating to the identification and nomination of directors who are women, Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities or members of visible minorities (the designated groups , as defined under the Canada Business Corporations Regulations, 2001), and has not adopted a target regarding members of the designated groups on its board. With the objective of fostering a diversity of expertise, viewpoint and competencies, the board charter provides that the nominations and corporate governance committee may consider a number of factors, including gender and membership in other designated groups, in assessing potential nominees. 
 The nominations and corporate governance committee assesses the work experience, other expertise, individual competencies and diversity of age, regional association and the designated groups that each existing director possesses and whether each nominee is able to fill any gaps amongst the existing directors. Additionally, the committee may consider any other factors that it believes to be relevant. The company does not believe that any one of these dimensions should be considered in isolation and without due regard to all of the other factors, in determining the ability of potential directors to contribute to the work of the board of directors. 
 148 

The board considers diversity through the annual nomination process, board assessment and other discussions. The board and nominations and corporate governance committee also specifically consider diversity through targeted director recruitment processes. With three of the company s current directors retiring in 2023, the board and nominations and corporate governance committee has been engaged in an extensive director recruitment process since 2021. Diversity and the composition of the board has been a key consideration throughout this process and the review of potential candidates, with the company instructing executive search firms to cultivate a diverse selection of potential nominees. The result of this process is the nomination of three new directors, S.R. Driscoll, J. Floren and G.J. Goldberg, bringing further experience and diverse perspectives to the board and maintaining 40 percent of the independent directors being women.

 The above diversity disclosure relies on voluntary self-identification by directors and nominees, and therefore only represents the information of individuals who have chosen to self-identify. The information has not been independently verified by the company. The board nominee composition charts on page 119 show the diversity of our board nominees with respect to gender, experience and regional association, but do not reflect membership in other designated groups. 
 Executive officer diversity 
 The company believes inclusion and diversity are key competitive strengths that are critical to maintaining the company s position as an industry leader. To ensure commitment at all levels of the company, inclusion and diversity, anti-harassment and equal employment opportunity performance is stewarded annually to the company s senior management. There is an in-depth succession planning process, which includes the consideration of various aspects of diversity as well as plans to address gaps, if any, for key positions. 
 The company s internal training programs emphasize the value of collaboration, appreciating differences and sustaining an inclusive work environment, keeping inclusion and diversity top-of-mind with all employees. Imperial also values external perspective and expertise. The company supports educational development and recruiting practices that facilitate the employment of Indigenous peoples, and in 2021 achieved Silver Certification in the Progressive Aboriginal Relations (PAR) program managed by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. Imperial maintains a supportive work environment though a range of development and networking programs, including employee-led diversity networks that are focused on common interests. These programs are conducted in both virtual and in-person formats to reach a broad range of employees. 
 In considering potential nominees for executive officer appointments, the executive resources committee considers diversity of gender and the other designated groups, work experience, other expertise, individual competencies and other dimensions of diversity in addition to the other factors described on page 160 . The company has not adopted a target regarding members of the designated groups in executive officer positions. The company does not believe that any one of these dimensions should be considered, without due regard to all of these other factors, in determining the ability of potential nominees to fill executive officers positions.

 Shareholder engagement 
 
 Shareholder engagement strategy focuses on wide-ranging dialogue between shareholders and management. 
 
 The company s senior management regularly meet with institutional investors and shareholders through industry conferences, roadshows and company hosted investor events. In response to COVID-19 and to ensure the health and safety of our employees, investors and shareholders, these meetings were held predominantly in a virtual format for the balance of 2021. In 2022, these shifted in large part, back to in-person engagements. Pertinent materials from these conferences and hosted events are available on the company s website. 
 Also in response to COVID-19 and to ensure the health and safety of its shareholders, directors, officers and stakeholders, the company took a number of steps to ensure active engagement through the annual meeting that was held in a virtual only format. Shareholders were given the opportunity to register a proxyholder to attend and ask questions in real time, and the company encouraged engagement from shareholders prior to the event. This format also allowed shareholders who may not otherwise have been able to attend in person to log in as a guest and follow the meeting. The webcast is available on the company website along with speeches and presentations from the annual general meeting and the outcome of the voting on each resolution. 
 The company also hosts regular quarterly earnings calls in connection with earnings releases, and archives of these calls (including transcripts) are available on Imperial s website for one year after each call. These calls allow the company to provide more insight and context regarding the company s performance, as well as directly address questions from the investment community. 
 The company annually solicits questions and comments from shareholders through the annual meeting of shareholders. The comments received are reviewed by senior management providing them with an indication of areas of interest to our shareholders, and those requiring a response are answered individually. In addition, the company s Investor Relations team proactively reaches out to shareholders to obtain their views on matters identified broadly by shareholders, including with respect to environment, social and governance topics, as well as optimal engagement approaches. The Investor Relations team is available to respond to shareholder and investor queries throughout the year.

 To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the company, the only shareholder who, as of February 8, 2023, owned beneficially, or exercised control or direction over, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the outstanding common shares of the company is Exxon Mobil Corporation, 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039-2298, which owns beneficially 406,569,870 common shares, representing approximately 69.6 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the company. As a consequence, the company is a controlled company for purposes of the listing standards of the NYSE American LLC and a majority controlled company for purposes of the TSX Company Manual. 
 
 Transactions with Exxon Mobil Corporation 
 The company has written procedures and controls that require any transactions between the company and ExxonMobil and its subsidiaries to be reviewed by controllers, tax, treasurers and legal to ensure that each agreement meets the company s policies and procedures, is fair, and complies with legal and tax requirements. These agreements may also be subject to review by the chairman, president, and chief executive officer. Annual training is provided for key individuals to ensure awareness of the requirements for identifying related party transactions, and procedures are in place to ensure reporting of these transactions is complete and accurate. Related party transactions with ExxonMobil and its subsidiaries are analyzed and reviewed by management on a quarterly basis to understand any significant variances from period to period, and reviewed with the board of directors on an annual basis. 
 
 The company undertook a number of issuer bid transactions during 2022 that involved ExxonMobil. On June 29, 2021, the company implemented a 12-month normal course share purchase program, allowing the company to purchase up to five percent of its outstanding common shares as of June 15, 2021, or a maximum of 35,583,671 shares. The program ended on January 31, 2022 upon the company purchasing the maximum allowable number of shares, with 10,822,142 common shares purchased on the open market and a corresponding 24,761,529 common shares purchased from ExxonMobil concurrent with, but outside of the program to maintain its shareholding at approximately 69.6 percent. 
 
 On May 6, 2022, the company commenced a substantial issuer bid that offered to purchase up to 2.5 billion of its common shares through a modified Dutch auction and proportionate tender offer. The substantial issuer bid was completed on June 15, 2022, with the company purchasing 32,467,532 common shares at a price of 77.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase of 2.5 billion and 4.9 percent of Imperial s issued and outstanding shares (as of the close of business on May 2, 2022).

 On June 29, 2022, a further normal course issuer bid was implemented, enabling the company to purchase up to five percent of its outstanding common shares as of June 15, 2022, or a maximum of 31,833,809 common shares. Purchases under the program were accelerated and the program ended on October 21, 2022 upon the company purchasing the maximum allowable number of shares, with 9,677,500 common shares purchased on the open market and a corresponding 22,156,309 common shares purchased from ExxonMobil concurrent with, but outside of the program to maintain its shareholding at approximately 69.6 percent. 
 
 On November 4, 2022, the company commenced a second substantial issuer bid in 2022 which offered to purchase up to 1.5 billion of its common shares through a modified Dutch auction and proportionate tender offer. The substantial issuer bid was completed on December 14, 2022, with the company purchasing 20,689,655 common shares at a price of 72.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase of 1.5 billion and 3.4 percent of Imperial s issued and outstanding shares (as of the close of business on October 31, 2022).

151 

The amounts of purchases and revenues by the company and its subsidiaries for other transactions in 2022 with ExxonMobil and its affiliates were 3,719 million and 17,042 million, respectively. These transactions were conducted on terms as favourable as they would have been with unrelated parties, and primarily consisted of the purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products, as well as technical, engineering and research and development costs. Transactions with ExxonMobil also included amounts paid and received in connection with the company s participation in a number of upstream activities conducted jointly in Canada. In addition, the company has existing agreements with affiliates of ExxonMobil to provide information technology and customer support services to the company and to share common business and operational support services to allow the companies to consolidate duplicate work and systems. The company has a contractual agreement with an affiliate of ExxonMobil in Canada to operate certain western Canada production properties owned by ExxonMobil. There are no asset ownership changes. 
 The company and that affiliate also have a contractual agreement to provide for equal participation in new upstream opportunities. The company had an existing agreement with ExxonMobil to provide for the delivery of management, business and technical services to Syncrude Canada Ltd. by ExxonMobil, which was terminated in connection with the transfer of operatorship of Syncrude on September 30, 2021. 
 As at December 31, 2022, the company had an outstanding loan of 3,447 million under an existing agreement with an affiliated company of ExxonMobil that provides for a long term, variable rate loan from ExxonMobil to the company of up to 7.75 billion (Canadian) at market interest rates.

 Business Perspective 
 Imperial's business involves investments that create shareholder value over long periods of time, requiring executives to maintain a long-term view when making decisions across a broad range of business investments. 
 
 In 2022, Imperial delivered exceptional business results across a wide range of performance dimensions. The company has remained focused on delivering long-term shareholder value and laying the foundation for future success with strong financial and operating performance, and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability. For more information on the 2022 key business results see page 167 . 
 Compensation Decisions The committee exercises oversight of a compensation program that aligns executives' pay with the results of their decisions and the returns of our shareholders over the long term. The program design is aligned with the core elements of the majority shareholder's compensation program, and is designed to drive long-term accountability, reward the highest standard of performance, and promote retention. 
 The compensation discussion and analysis ("CD A") section that follows describes the compensation program for the company's named executive officers and how the program supports the business goals of the company. 
 Key decisions approved by the committee, reflective of strong business results in 2022, are as follows: 
 The committee granted base salary increases to named executive officers, consistent with the salary program for all executives. 
 The 2022 bonus program awards were approved at higher levels than 2021, reflective of strong business performance. 
 The committee granted restricted stock unit awards in keeping with program design, with the value of awards having increased year-over-year in line with increases in stock price. 
 The committee has reviewed and discussed the CD A with management of the company and has recommended to the board that the CD A be included in the company s management proxy circular for the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders and annual report of Form 10-K. On behalf of the committee, I encourage you to read the comprehensive disclosure in the CD A that follows. The committee is committed to overseeing all aspects of the executive compensation program in the best interests of the company and all shareholders.

Overview 
 
 The company takes a long-term view to managing its business. 
 
 Our objective is to meet society s needs with the products that are essential for modern life while playing a key role in addressing the challenges of climate change. The company takes a long-term view in managing its business rather than reacting to short-term business cycles. The company s strategies provide the framework to deliver on its commitments, create shareholder value throughout the commodity price cycle, and address the dual challenge of meeting growing energy demand while reducing environmental impacts. 
 
 The compensation program design aligns with the long-term sustainability of the business and supports key business strategies to maximize shareholder value: 
 
 Canadian business environment 
 Large, accessible upstream resources; 
 Mature, competitive downstream markets; 
 Evolving environmental, fiscal, and energy policies impacting global competitiveness; and 
 Market access limitations and uncertainties. 
 
 Business model 
 Long-life, competitively advantaged assets; 
 Disciplined investment and cost management; 
 Value-chain integration and synergies; 
 High-impact technologies and innovation; and 
 Operational excellence and responsible growth. 
 
 Key business strategies 
 Deliver industry-leading performance in safety, emissions reductions, environmental performance and reliability; 
 Grow profitable production and sales volumes; 
 Disciplined and long-term focus on improving the productivity of the company s asset mix; and 
 Best-in-class cost structure to support industry-leading returns on capital and cash flow.

 The above programs are underpinned by our pension and savings plans which provides for financial security after employment. 
 
 Risk and governance 
 The company is governed by a comprehensive and well-established risk management system, and the company s success in managing risk over time has been achieved through emphasis on execution of this disciplined management framework. The company operates in an industry in which effective risk management is critical. The company s risk management framework includes a process for identifying, prioritizing, measuring, and managing the principal risks across the company, as well as assessing the company s response to these risks. For further discussion on the company s risk management system and oversight, see Risk oversight within the Statement of corporate governance practice on page 130 . 
 The company s long-term orientation and compensation program design encourage the highest performance standards and discourage inappropriate risk taking. The compensation program design features described below are designed to incent effective management of current and future operating and financial risks associated with the company s business, including risks related to climate change, in order to: 
 158 

protect the safety and security of our employees, the communities, and the environment in which we operate; 
 manage risk and operate the business with effective business controls; 
 create sustainable value for shareholders by increasing shareholder return, net income, and return on average capital employed ; while positioning the company for long-term success in a lower-emission future; and 
 advance the long-term strategic direction of the company. 
 
 non-GAAP financial measure see Frequently used terms section on page 171 for definition. 
 
 The table below outlines the design features of our compensation programs that discourage inappropriate risk taking: 
 
 Design feature 
 Risk management 
 Common programs All executives employed by the company, including the named executive officers, participate in common programs (the same salary, incentive, and retirement programs). Similar compensation design features and allocation of awards within the programs discourage inappropriate risk taking. Compensation is differentiated based on individual performance assessment, experience and pay grade. 
 All executives on assignment from an affiliate of the company, including the named executive officers on assignment from Exxon Mobil Corporation and Esso Australia Pty Ltd., also participate in common programs that are administered by Exxon Mobil Corporation or such affiliates. The named executive officers on assignment receive restricted stock units from Imperial. 
 T he executive resources committee ("committee") reviews and approves annual compensation recommendations for each named executive officer prior to implementation. 
 Executive stock ownership Long holding periods on restricted stock units (RSUs) results in executives maintaining significant stock ownership during employment and for 7 years into retirement, with a longer holding period for the chairman, president and chief executive officer up to 10 years into retirement. 
 Significant pay at risk Uniquely long restriction periods on RSUs substantially increase the percentage of career compensation at risk well into retirement. 
 Unvested RSUs cannot be used as collateral for any purpose. 
 Strong forfeiture provisions Unvested RSUs are at risk of forfeiture for resignation or detrimental activity, even if such detrimental activity occurs or is discovered after resignation or retirement. 
 Clawback policy The entire annual bonus is subject to recoupment (clawback) in the event of a material negative restatement of the company's reported financial or operating results. This reinforces the importance of the company's financial controls and compliance programs. Clawback provisions also apply if an executive resigns or engages in detrimental activity. 
 No guaranteed bonuses Bonus is subject to year-on-year changes in business performance; remains at risk 
 Demonstrated by bonus program suspension in 2020; no award granted. 
 No additional stock grants to balance losses in value The committee does not support a practice of offsetting a loss or gain in the value of prior restricted share units by the value of current year grants. 
 Such a practice would minimize the risk/reward profile of stock-based awards and undermine the long-term view that executives are expected to adopt. 
 No accelerated vesting at retirement RSUs are not subject to acceleration, not even at retirement, except in the case of death. 
 Unvested RSUs cannot be used as collateral for any purpose. 
 
 For more details about the aforementioned compensation components, see the Compensation program design section. 
 159 

Other supporting compensation and staffing practices 
 The company's defined benefit pension plan and supplemental pension arrangements are highly dependent on executives remaining with the company for a career and performing at the highest levels until retirement. This dimension of total compensation encourages executives to take a long-term view when making business decisions and to focus on achieving sustainable growth for shareholders. 
 The use of perquisites at the company is very limited, and mainly composed of financial planning for senior executives and the selective use of club memberships which are largely tied to building business relationships. 
 Tax assistance is provided for employees on expatriate assignment. This assistance consists primarily of a tax equalization component designed to maintain the employees overall income tax burden at approximately the same level had they remained in their home country. The expatriate relocation program is broad-based and applies to all executive, management, professional and technical transferred employees. 
 The company does not have written employment contracts or any other agreement with its named executive officers providing for payments on change of control or termination of employment. 

Hedging policy 
 Company policy prohibits all employees, including executives, and directors, from being a party to derivative or similar financial instruments, including puts, calls, or other options, future or forward contracts, or equity swaps or collars, with respect to the company or Exxon Mobil Corporation stock. 
 
 Business performance and basis for compensation 
 The assessment of employee performance is conducted through the company s annual performance assessment program. The process assesses performance against relevant business performance measures and objectives, including the means by which performance is achieved. These business performance measures include: 
 
 safety, health, and environmental performance; 
 risk management; 
 total shareholder return; 
 net income; 
 return on average capital employed ; 
 cash flow from operations and asset sales ; 
 operating performance of the upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses; and 
 progress on advancing government relations and long-term strategic interests. 
 
 non-GAAP financial measure see Frequently used terms section on page 171 for definition. 
 The performance assessment program includes a comparative assessment of employee performance using a standard approach throughout the organization and at all levels. It is integrated with the compensation program, which results in significant pay differentiation based on performance. The performance assessment program is also integrated with the executive development process. Both have been in place for many years and are the basis for planning individual development and succession for management positions. 
 
 Succession planning 
 A long established program of management development and succession planning is in place to reinforce a career orientation and ensure continuity of leadership. The committee is responsible for approving specific succession plans for the position of chairman, president and chief executive officer, and key senior executive positions, including all officers of the company. It considers candidates for these positions from within the company and certain candidates from Exxon Mobil Corporation and its affiliates. This in-depth review of succession plans includes the consideration of various aspects of diversity as well as plans to address gaps, if any, for key executives. The company has a long-standing practice of reviewing with senior management the diversity of the organization with focus on women, Indigenous people, persons with disabilities, and visible minorities. These reviews include recruitment, attrition, training and development. For more information regarding executive officer diversity see page 149 . 
 The chairman, president and chief executive officer also discusses the strengths, progress, and development needs of key succession candidates regularly. This provides the board an opportunity to confirm a pipeline of highly skilled and diverse talent exists to enable achievement of long-term strategic objectives. The committee makes recommendations to the board of directors for selection of all officers of the company, as well as other key senior executive positions reporting to the chairman, president and chief executive officer.

Compensation program design 
 
 The company s compensation program is designed to reward performance, promote retention, and encourage long-term business decisions. 
 
 Approach to executive compensation 
 The decisions that the company s executives make and the risks they manage play out over multi-year time horizons. Executives are required to carefully consider current and future risks, such as those related to climate change, and to make decisions across a broad range of business investments that generate sustainable shareholder value over the long term. 
 
 The company's executive compensation program design aligns executives' pay with the results of their decisions and shareholder returns over the long term. The program is designed to drive long-term accountability, reward the highest standard of performance, and promote retention. 
 
 Drive long-term accountability The company's strategic objectives have been established to drive sustainable value while positioning the company for long-term success in a lower-emissions future. These objectives are translated into annual plan goals, which are reviewed and approved by the Board and provides the framework for the company's commitments. 
 
 Reward outstanding performance Performance is foundational to the company's executive compensation program design. The extent to which executives achieve pre-established goals, assessed over near- and long-term horizons, is a key differentiating factor in executives' pay deliberations. Performance evaluation directly impacts level of base salary, bonus, and long-term incentive awards. 
 Promote retention This long-term orientation also underpins how the company develops talent. It begins with recruiting exceptional people, and continues with individually planned experiences and training, which leads to broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. 
 The compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent for a career through compensation that is market competitive, highly differentiated by individual performance, and with long restriction periods that promote retention. Career orientation among a dedicated and highly skilled workforce, combined with the highest performance standards, contributes to the company's leadership in the industry and serves the interests of shareholders in the long term. The average service of the named executive officers is 32 years which reflects this on-going career orientation strategy. 
 The company s executive compensation program is composed of base salaries, as well as near-term cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. 
 
 Base salary 
 Base salary represents 10 to 30 percent of total direct compensation, and is intended to provide competitive base pay. It also directly affects the level of retirement benefits. 
 The company s overall salary program is determined by annual benchmarking. Individual salary increases are the result of individual performance, experience, and changes to pay grade, and reflects market analysis and competitiveness at the time of the decision. 
 2022 decisions 
 For 2022, the executive resources committee ("committee") granted salary increases to named executive officers consistent with the salary program for all executives. 

161 

Annual bonus 
 The company s annual bonus program represents 10 to 25 percent of total direct compensation, and is intended to link executive pay to annual company earnings performance. The bonus program is established annually by the committee based on earnings, and can be highly variable depending on these results. 
 In establishing the annual bonus program, the committee: 
 considers input from the chairman, president and chief executive officer on performance of the company and from the company s internal compensation advisors regarding compensation trends as obtained from external consultants; 
 considers the linkage to the majority shareholder s bonus program given the company s working interest is included in Exxon Mobil Corporation earnings; 
 considers annual net income of the company; and 
 uses judgment to manage the overall size of the annual bonus program taking into consideration the cyclical nature and long-term orientation of the business. 
 2022 decisions 
 2022 bonus program awards were approved at higher levels than 2021, reflective of strong business performance. 
 This resulted in 53 executives receiving an annual bonus in 2022. 
 The cost of the 2022 annual bonus program was 8.5 million versus 4.2 million in 2021 and 0 in 2020. 
 Starting in 2021, bonus awards are paid in full in the year of grant, rather than as a combination of cash and earnings bonus units, consistent with market practice and resulting in a stronger link to earnings performance and individual performance differentiation. While no earnings bonus units were granted in 2022, the company s executives, including the named executive officers, had outstanding earnings bonus units that vested in 2022. 
 Earnings bonus units are cash awards that are tied to future cumulative earnings per share. 
 Earnings bonus units pay out when a specified level of cumulative earnings per share (or trigger) is achieved or in three years at a reduced level. The trigger is intentionally set at a level that is expected to be achieved within the three-year period and reinforces the company s principle of sustained improvement in the company s business performance and aligns the interests of executives with those of long-term shareholders; and 
 If cumulative earnings per share do not reach the trigger within three years, the payment with respect to the earnings bonus units will be reduced to an amount equal to the number of units multiplied by the actual cumulative earnings per share over the three-year period. The amount of the award, once vested, will never exceed the original grant value. The delayed payout of the earnings bonus units puts part of the annual bonus at risk of forfeiture and thus reinforces the performance basis of the annual bonus grant. 
 Forfeiture and claw-back The annual bonus, including earnings bonus units, are subject to forfeiture and claw-back if: 
 An executive retires before normal retirement time. 
 The company has indicated its intention not to forfeit outstanding awards of employees who retire at age 65. In other circumstances, where a recipient retires before age 65, the company may determine that awards shall not be forfeited. 
 An executive s employment with the company terminates (for any reason, whether at initiative of employee, the company or otherwise), with forfeiture and claw-back at the company's discretion. 
 An executive, without the consent of the company, engages in any activity, during employment or after retirement or termination of employment, which is detrimental to the company, including working for a competitor; or 
 There is a material negative restatement of the company s reported financial or operating results. For executive officers of the company, some or all of any unvested earnings bonus units granted in the three years prior to the restatement are subject to forfeiture. In addition, any cash amounts received from bonus or earnings bonus units that were paid out up to five years prior to the restatement are subject to claw-back. 

162 

Restricted stock units 
 The vesting periods of the company s long-term incentive program are greater than those in use by comparator companies. 
 Restricted stock units represent over 50 percent of total direct compensation, and are intended to link executive pay to the returns of long-term shareholders and encourage a long-term view through the commodity price cycle. Restricted stock units are granted to select employees of the company, select employees of a designated affiliate, and nonemployee directors of the company. 
 
 Employee group Vesting 
 On the anniversary of the date of grant 
 For the chairman, president and chief executive officer 50 percent in 5 years and 50 percent in 10 years 
 For all other executives 50 percent in 3 years and 50 percent in 7 years 
 
 The vesting periods, which are typically greater than those in use by other companies, reinforce the company s focus on growing shareholder value over the long term by linking a large percentage of executive compensation and the shareholding net worth of executives to the value of the company s stock. The long vesting periods ensure that a substantial portion of the compensation received by the chairman, president and chief executive officer, as well as other key senior executives, will be received after retirement. The value of this compensation is at risk in the event that their decisions prior to retirement negatively impact share market value after retirement, with the objective to hold senior executives accountable for many years into the future, and even into retirement, for investment and operating decisions made today. The design of our program removes employee discretion in the timing of exercising restricted stock units, reinforces retention objectives, and supports alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
 The basis for the grant includes an annual assessment of individual performance including a review of business performance results as noted on page 167 . The amount granted is intended to provide an incentive to promote individual contribution to the company s performance and to retain employees. Grants may be adjusted periodically based on an assessment of the program s competitive orientation. An individual s grant amount may be reduced at time of grant, if recent performance is deemed to have changed significantly at that time. As a matter of principle, the company does not offset losses on prior grants with higher share awards in subsequent grants, nor does the company re-price restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are not included in pension calculations. Restricted stock units cannot be assigned. 
 The number of common shares of the company issuable under the plan to any insiders (as defined by the Toronto Stock Exchange) cannot exceed 10 percent of the issued and outstanding common shares, whether at any time or as issued in any one year. 
 The company s directors and officers as a group hold approximately 16 percent of the unvested restricted stock units that give the recipient the right to receive common shares that represent about 0.05 percent of the company s outstanding common shares. Currently, the maximum number of common shares that any one person may receive from the vesting of restricted stock units is 345,250 common shares, which is about 0.06 percent of the outstanding common shares. 
 Consistent with the program documentation, the board of directors may amend the plan without shareholder approval for RSUs previously issued or to be issued in the future, unless the amendment is with respect to: 
 increasing the shares served for issuance; 
 increasing the vesting price; 
 extending eligibility to participate in the plan to persons not included in the plan; 
 extending the right of a grantee to transfer or assign RSUs; or 
 adjusting the vesting date for any RSUs previously granted. 
 
 163 

2022 decisions 
 The committee granted awards in keeping with program design. 
 The value of long-term awards increased year-over-year, in line with increases in stock price; changes in award grants for named executive officers reflect individual performance and/or change in pay grade. 
 In 2022, 1,020 recipients, including 62 executives, were granted 867,640 restricted stock units. 
 Exxon Mobil Corporation has a plan similar to the company s restricted stock unit plan, under which grantees may receive restricted stock or restricted stock units, both of which are referred to herein as Exxon Mobil Corporation restricted stock. B.W. Corson holds Exxon Mobil Corporation restricted stock granted in 2018 and previous years, as well as the company s restricted stock units granted since 2019. D.E. Lyons holds Exxon Mobil Corporation restricted stock granted in 2017 and previous years, as well as the company s restricted stock units granted since 2018. S.P. Younger holds Exxon Mobil Corporation restricted stock granted in 2019 and previous years, as well as the company s restricted stock units granted in 2020. 
 Forfeiture and claw-back Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture and claw-back if: 
 A recipient retires before normal retirement time. 
 The company has indicated its intention not to forfeit restricted stock units of employees who retire at age 65. In other circumstances where a recipient retires before age 65, the company may determine that restricted stock units shall not be forfeited. 
 A recipient s employment with the company terminates (for any reason, whether at initiative of employee, the company or otherwise), with forfeiture and claw-back at the company's discretion. 
 A recipient, without the consent of the company, engages in any activity, during employment or after retirement or termination of employment, which is detrimental to the company, including working for a competitor. 
 With respect to executives, at any time prior to vesting of the outstanding awards. 
 With respect to all other employees, for a period of up to three years after retirement or the termination of employment. 
 
 Vesting of restricted stock units 
 The vesting period for restricted stock unit awards is not subject to acceleration, except in the case of death. Upon vesting, each restricted stock unit entitles the recipient the right to receive an amount equal to the value of one common share of the company, based on the five day average closing price of the company s shares on the vesting date and the four preceding trading days. For units granted to senior executives other than the chairman, president and chief executive officer, 50 percent of the units vest as a cash payment on the third and seventh anniversary of the grant date, except that for units vesting on the seventh anniversary that were granted to Canadian residents, the recipient may receive one common share per unit or elect to receive a cash payment for the units. For all units granted to the chairman, president and chief executive officer, upon vesting, the recipient may receive one common share of the company per unit or elect to receive a cash payment for the units. During the restricted period, the recipient will also receive cash payments equivalent to the cash dividends paid to holders of regular common stock. 
 In the case of any subdivision, consolidation, or reclassification of the shares of the company or other relevant change in the capitalization of the company, the company, in its discretion, may make appropriate adjustments in the number of common shares to be issued and the calculation of the cash amount payable per restricted stock unit. 

Amendments to the restricted stock unit plan 
 In 2016, the restricted stock unit plan was amended to update provisions regarding forfeiture of restricted stock units in the event of detrimental activity, extending the period from two years to the current periods noted above. Further, the amendments provided a new vesting option in addition to the existing vesting options previously described, such that the second 50 percent of the restricted stock units may vest on the tenth anniversary following the grant date. 
 In 2020, the restricted stock unit plan was amended to update provisions regarding the vesting periods for the units granted in 2020 and onwards to the chairman, president and chief executive officer such that 50 percent of restricted stock units vest on the fifth anniversary and remaining 50 percent on the tenth anniversary. For awards granted prior to 2020, the vesting of the tenth anniversary portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years. 
 164 

As a result of an employee stock program expansion implemented in 2022, the restricted stock unit plan was amended to include an additional vesting schedule, in which some new non-executive participants will be eligible for awards granted that vest 100 percent after 3 years. 
 
 Retirement plans 
 The company's approach to talent development stems from the need to develop future leaders broadly and deeply given the complexity and long-term nature of the business. Retirement plans support the company's talent management approach and are designed to attract and retain talent for a career. Retirement plans include: 
 
 A company savings plan that is attractive to new hires who can begin building an account balance immediately upon achieving eligibility; and 
 Defined benefit plans, such as the company's pension plans, that help retain mid- and late-career employees until retirement eligibility. These are viewed as the primary vehicle for retirement planning. 
 
 Named executive officers participate in the same pension plan, including supplemental pension arrangements outside the registered plan, as other employees, except for B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons and S.P. Younger who participate in Exxon Mobil Corporation or respective affiliates pension plans. 
 
 Below are brief descriptions of the company's plans. 
 
 Plan Description Savings plan Employees with more than one year of service may contribute between 1 and 30 percent of normal earnings via payroll deductions. 
 The company provides matching contributions up to 6 which vary depending on the amount of employee contributions and which defined benefit pension arrangement the employee participates 
 Employee and company contributions can be allocated in any combination to a non-registered (tax-paid) account, or a registered (tax-deferred) group retirement savings plan (RRSP), subject to contribution limits under the Income Tax Act. 
 Registered pension plan The company provides a registered defined pension benefit when leaving the company if age, service, and other provisions under the plan are met. 
 Pension is subject to income tax regulations that impose limits on the amounts that can be paid from a registered plan. 
 The pension plan provides for pension benefits accrual only until December 1st in the year the employee reaches the age of 71. 
 The company does not grant additional pension service credit. 
 Supplemental pension arrangement (SPA) 
 SPA addresses any portions of the defined benefit that cannot be paid from the registered plan due to income tax regulations. 
 For executive officers who receive an annual bonus, the company's SPA can also provide an annual benefit tied to annual bonus. 
 SPA may be taken as a lump sum or an annuity. 
 No SPA amounts are payable if an employee resigns or is terminated with cause before reaching retirement eligibility. 

The estimated benefits that would be payable upon retirement to each named executive officer under the company s pension plan and the supplemental pension arrangements can be found in the pension plan benefits table starting on page 177 . 
 
 165 

B.A. Jolly and J.R. Wetmore participate in the 1.6 percent provision of the company s pension plan. Key features of this plan for these executives include: 
 An annual benefit equal to 1.6 percent multiplied by final average earnings multiplied by years of service, with a partial offset for applicable government pension benefits. Final average earnings consists of base salary over the highest 36 consecutive months in the 10 years of service prior to retirement. 
 An option to forego a portion of the company s matching contributions to the savings plan in order to receive an additional 0.4 percent of final average earnings. 
 
 Key features of the SPA plan for the 1.6 percent provision of the pension plan include: 
 Executive officers who receive an annual bonus, and meet the criteria of the SPA, can also receive an annual benefit of 1.6 percent of final average bonus earnings multiplied by years of service. 
 Final average bonus earnings include the average bonus for the three highest grants of the last five bonus years awarded prior to retirement for eligible executives. 
 Annual bonus could include the cash amounts that are paid at grant and the maximum settlement value of any earnings bonus units received, as described starting on page 162 . The value of the earnings bonus units is expected to pay out, subject to forfeiture provisions, and are therefore included for supplemental pension arrangement purposes in the year of grant rather than the year of payment. 
 
 B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons and S.P. Younger are not participants in the company s pension plan, but are participants in the Exxon Mobil Corporation or respective affiliates pension and savings plans: 
 Mr. Corson and Mr. Lyons participate in the Exxon Mobil Pension Plan (EMPP). Under this plan, the pension is payable in U.S. dollars and is calculated based on final average base salary over the highest 36 consecutive months in the 10 years of service prior to retirement. They are also eligible for the ExxonMobil Supplemental Pension Plan (SPP) for pension benefits that cannot be paid from the EMPP due to IRS limitations. The ExxonMobil Additional Payment Plan (APP) provides a pension based on the average annual bonus for the three highest grants of the last five awarded prior to retirement. The SPP and APP are paid as a lump sum. 
 Mr. Younger participates in the Esso Australia Pty Ltd. defined benefit plan. Under this plan, the pension is payable in Australian dollars and is calculated based on final average base salary over the highest 12 consecutive months in the 10 years of service prior to retirement.

 In addition to the assessment of business and individual performance, the executive resources committee ("committee") relies on market comparisons to a group of major Canadian companies. 
 
 Comparator companies 
 The following criteria are used to select comparator companies: 
 Canadian companies or Canadian affiliates; 
 large operating scope and complexity; 
 capital intensive; and 
 proven sustainability over time. 
 List of comparator companies: 
 Energy: Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy Inc., CNOOC International, ConocoPhillips Canada, Crescent Point Energy, Enbridge Inc., Gibson Energy, Irving Oil Ltd., MEG Energy, NOVA Chemicals Corporation, Nutrien Ltd., Ovintiv Inc., Parkland Corporation, Repsol Oil Gas Canada Inc., Shell Canada Limited, Suncor Energy Inc., TC Energy Corporation, Valero Energy 
 Non-energy : BCE Inc., Canadian Pacific Railway Limited, Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited, General Electric Canada, IBM Canada Ltd., Proctor Gamble Inc., Royal Bank of Canada, Teck Resources

The company is a national employer drawing from a wide range of disciplines. Compensation trends based on survey data are prepared annually by an independent external consultant with additional analysis and recommendation provided by the company s internal compensation advisors. Rather than targeting a specific percentile, the committee applies well-informed judgment, using a broader and more flexible orientation, generally a range around the median of the comparator energy companies compensation. This approach applies to salaries and the annual incentive program that includes annual bonus and restricted stock units, which are also considered in relation to the majority shareholder program. 
 This overall approach provides the company with the ability to: 
 better respond to changing business conditions; 
 manage salaries based on a career orientation; 
 minimize potential for automatic increasing of salaries, which could occur with an inflexible and narrow target among benchmarked companies; and 
 differentiate executives salaries based on performance and experience levels. 
 The elements of Exxon Mobil Corporation and respective affiliates compensation programs for B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons and S.P. Younger, including salary, annual bonus and restricted stock units (long-term) compensation considerations, are generally similar to those of the company. 
 
 Business performance results for consideration 
 The operating and financial performance results listed below and the company s continued maintenance of sound business controls and a strong corporate governance environment formed the basis for the salary and incentive award decisions made by the committee in 2022. The committee considered the results over multiple years, relative to the company s proven business model and strategies, to deliver long-term shareholder value.

Performance assessment considerations 
 The company's business results form the context in which the committee assesses the individual performance of each senior executive. Annually, the chairman, president, and chief executive officer reviews the performance of the senior executives with the committee. Performance is evaluated based on accomplishments versus plan goals and objectives, with performance results informing level of pay, including salary, bonus, and long-term incentive awards. 
 The same long-term key business strategies noted on page 157 and the company s business performance results are key elements in the assessment of the chairman, president, and chief executive officer s performance by the executive resources committee. 
 In addition to the formal annual evaluation, the performance of all named executive officers is assessed by the board of directors throughout the year during specific business reviews and board committee meetings that provide information on strategy development, operating and financial results, safety, health, and environmental results, business controls, and other areas pertinent to the general performance of the company. 
 The committee does not use quantitative targets or formulae to assess individual executive performance or determine compensation. The committee does not assign weights to the factors considered. Formula-based performance assessments and compensation typically require emphasis on two or three business metrics. For the company to be an industry leader and effectively manage the technical complexity and integrated scope of 
 168 

its operations, senior executives must advance multiple strategies and objectives in parallel, versus emphasizing one or two at the expense of others that require equal attention. 
 Senior executives and officers are expected to perform at the highest level or they are replaced. If it is determined that another executive is ready and would make a stronger contribution than one of the current incumbents, a replacement plan is implemented. 
 
 2022 chief executive officer compensation assessment 
 B.W. Corson was appointed to the board and as president of the company on September 17, 2019 and assumed the additional roles of chairman and chief executive officer on January 1, 2020. Mr. Corson worked for Exxon Mobil Corporation and its predecessor companies since 1983. His level of salary in 2022 was determined by the committee based on his individual performance and to align with that of his peers in ExxonMobil. For 2022, the committee approved an increase of 31,000 U.S. to 804,000 U.S. For 2023, the committee approved a salary increase of 80,000 U.S. to 884,000 U.S. effective January 1, 2023. 
 Mr. Corson s 2022 annual bonus was based on his performance as assessed by the committee. His long-term incentive award was granted in the form of Imperial restricted stock units, not Exxon Mobil Corporation restricted stock, to reinforce alignment of his interests with that of the company s shareholders. His company restricted stock units are subject to vesting periods longer than those applied by most companies. The purpose of these long vesting periods is to reinforce the long investment lead times in the business and to link a substantial portion of Mr. Corson s shareholding net worth to the performance of the company. As such, the realized value of the long-term incentive grants may differ from the amounts shown in the summary compensation table, depending on company performance at time of future vesting. During these vesting periods, the awards are subject to risk of forfeiture based on detrimental activity even after retirement. 
 The committee has determined that the total compensation of Mr. Corson was appropriate based on the company s financial and operating performance, and its assessment of his effectiveness in leading the organization relative to the business performance measures outlined on page 160 . Taking all factors into consideration, the committee s decisions on compensation of the chief executive officer reflect judgment, rather than the application of formulae or targets. 

Pay awarded to other named executive officers 
 Within the context of the compensation program structure and performance assessment processes previously described, the value of 2022 incentive awards and salary adjustments align with: 
 performance of the company; 
 individual performance; 
 long-term strategic plan of the business; and 
 annual compensation of comparator companies. 
 Taking all factors into consideration, the committee s decisions on pay awarded to other named executive officers reflect judgment, rather than the application of formulae or targets. The committee approved the individual elements of compensation and the total compensation as shown in the summary compensation table on page 172 . 
 
 Independent consultant 
 In fulfilling its responsibilities during 2022, the committee did not retain an independent consultant or advisor in determining compensation for any of the company s officers or any other senior executives. The company s management retained an independent consultant to provide an assessment of competitive compensation and market data for all salaried levels of employees of the company. While providing this data, they did not provide individual compensation recommendations or advice for the compensation of the chairman, president and chief executive officer or other senior executives.

Performance graph 
 The following graph shows changes over the past 5 years in the value of 100 invested in (i) Imperial Oil Limited common shares, (ii) the S P/TSX Composite Index, and (iii) the S P/TSX Composite Energy Index. The S P/TSX Composite Energy Index is currently made up of share performance data for 39 oil and gas companies including integrated oil companies, oil and gas producers, and oil and gas service companies. 
 The year-end values in the graph represent appreciation in share price and the value of dividends paid and reinvested. The calculations exclude trading commissions and taxes. Total shareholder returns from each investment, whether measured in dollars or percent, can be calculated from the year-end investment values shown beneath the graph. 
 During the past 5 years, the company s cumulative total shareholder return was 92 percent, for an average annual return of 14 percent. Total direct compensation for named executive officers generally reflects the trend in total shareholder returns as the largest single component of executive compensation is awarded in the form of restricted stock units with long holding periods. This design reinforces the long-term linkage between executive compensation and the shareholding net worth of executives to the return on the company s stock realized by shareholders. Total direct compensation includes salary, the annual bonus grant, and the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit award which is equal to the price of the company s common shares on the date of grant.

Frequently used terms 
 The term total direct compensation is compensation granted during the year, including salary, the annual bonus, and the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit award which is equal to the price of the company s common shares on the date of grant. 
 The following definitions are used in the compensation discussion and analysis as several of Imperial s business and financial performance measures. These measures are not prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These measures constitute non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, and specified financial measures under National Instrument 52-112 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure of the Canadian Securities Administrators. Non-GAAP financial measures and specified financial measures are not standardized financial measures under GAAP and do not have standardized definitions. As such, these measures may not be directly comparable to measures presented by other companies, and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For additional information and reconciliation with respect to the terms, see the Frequently used terms section of the company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities and asset sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 Return on average capital employed is a non-GAAP financial measure that is a measure of capital productivity, and equals net income excluding the after-tax cost of financing divided by total average capital employed. Capital employed is property, plant and equipment, and other assets, less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt, plus the company s share of equity company debt. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is cash flows from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment and equity company investments plus proceeds from asset sales. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is cash flows from (used in) operating activities within the company s consolidated statement of cash flows. This measure is used to evaluate cash available for financing activities (including but not limited to dividends and share purchases) after investment in the business.

Footnotes to the Summary compensation table for named executive officers 
 
 (a) The compensation for B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons, and S.P. Younger is paid directly by Exxon Mobil Corporation and respective affiliates, with the exception of the compensation related to the vesting of the company s restricted stock units and dividend equivalents on outstanding restricted stock units. They also receive employee benefits under their respective affiliates employee benefit plans, and not under the company s employee benefit plans. The company reimburses the respective affiliates for applicable compensation paid and employee benefits provided to them. The company does not reimburse Exxon Mobil Corporation for the cost of incentive awards granted by Exxon Mobil Corporation. 
 (b) The amounts listed in the Salary column for each named executive officer on expatriate assignment (B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons and S.P. Younger) are paid in their local currency, but disclosed in Canadian dollars. Mr. Corson s and Mr. Lyons salaries are paid in U.S. dollars and were converted to Canadian dollars at the average 2022 exchange rate of 1.3013. In 2021 and 2020, the average exchange rate was 1.2535 and 1.3415 respectively. Mr. Younger s salary is paid in Australian dollars and was converted to Canadian dollars at the average 2022 exchange rate 0.9032. In 2021 and 2020, the average exchange rate was 0.9421 and 0.9247. 
 (c) The grant date fair value equals the number of restricted stock units multiplied by the closing price of the company s shares on the date of grant. The closing price of the company s shares on the grant date in 2022 was 72.62, which is the same as the accounting fair value for the restricted stock units on the date of grant. The closing price of the company s shares on the grant date in 2021 was 44.08 and in 2020 was 24.26, which is the same as the accounting fair value for the restricted stock units on the date of grant. The company chose this method of valuation as it believes it results in the most accurate representation of fair value. 
 (d) The company has not granted stock options since 2002. The stock option plan expired in 2012. 
 (e) The amounts listed in the Annual incentive plans column for each named executive officer represent their cash bonus. In 2021 and 2022, the bonus award was paid in full as a cash bonus in the year of grant rather than a combination of cash and earnings bonus units. In 2020, the company suspended the annual cash bonus program, and therefore no cash payment was made. B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons, and S.P. Younger participate in Exxon Mobil Corporation s annual cash bonus program, which is similar to the company s plan, and is paid in U.S. dollars, but disclosed in Canadian dollars. In 2021 and 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation s bonus award was also paid in full as a cash bonus in the year of grant rather than a combination of cash and earnings bonus units. In 2020, Exxon Mobil Corporation s annual bonus program was also suspended. For amounts paid in 2022 and 2021 in U.S. dollars, they were converted to Canadian dollars at the average exchange rate of 1.3013 and 1.2535 respectively. 
 (f) The amounts listed in the Long-term incentive plans column represent earnings bonus units related to prior year grants that paid out in year. In 2020 and 2021, the maximum settlement value (trigger) or cumulative earnings per share was not achieved, therefore no payments were made. B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons, and S.P. Younger participate in Exxon Mobil Corporation s program, which is similar to the company s program, and is paid in U.S. dollars, but disclosed in Canadian dollars. Under the Exxon Mobil Corporation s program, the maximum settlement value (trigger) or cumulative earnings per share was not achieved, therefore no payments were made in 2020 and 2021. For amounts paid in 2022 in U.S. dollars, they were converted to Canadian dollars at the average exchange rate of 1.3013. 
 (g) Pension value is the Compensatory change in pensions as of December 31, 2022 as set out in the Pension plan benefits table on page 177 . 
 (h) The amounts listed in the All other compensation column include dividend equivalent payments on restricted stock units granted, savings plans contributions, expatriate assignment costs, parking and the cost of perquisites including financial planning and business club memberships, as well as security costs and costs associated with participation in Exxon Mobil Corporation s executive life insurance benefit plan, as applicable. 
 In 2022, B.W. Corson received 33,039 of senior executive life insurance premiums, 14,185 for financial planning services, and 3,372 for club membership. For all other named executive officers, the aggregate value of perquisites received in 2022 was not greater than 50,000 or 10 percent of the named executive officer s base salary. 
 It is noted that in 2022, the actual dividend equivalent payments on the company restricted stock units were 281,520 for B.W. Corson, 96,084 for D.E. Lyons, 37,422 for S.P. Younger, 87,023 for B.A. Jolly, and 72,578 for J.R. Wetmore. The dividend equivalent payments on Exxon Mobil Corporation s restricted stock were 406,526 for Mr. Corson, 66,522 for Mr. Lyons and 91,930 for Mr. Younger; these amounts were paid in U.S. dollars and converted to Canadian dollars at the average 2022 exchange rate of 1.3013. 
 For the named executive officers on expatriate assignment (B.W. Corson, D.E. Lyons and S.P. Younger), All other compensation also includes expatriate assignment costs which consist of expatriate allowances and the net effect of tax equalization costs in the year. Tax equalization costs include the net effect of taxes paid by the companies to local taxing authorities on behalf of the named executive officer offset by a withholding from their income that approximates the amount of tax they would pay if they had not gone on expatriate assignment. Tax equalization is an integral part of the expatriate relocation program and is designed to maintain an individual s overall tax burden at approximately the same level it would have otherwise been, had they remained in their home country. Tax equalization amounts vary from one year to the next and the net impact may be positive or negative in the year. 
 (i) Total compensation consists of the total dollar value of Salary , Share-based awards , Option-based awards , Non-equity incentive plan compensation , Pension value and All other compensation .

For S.P Younger, this is not applicable as his age is under 55 years, and therefore he is not currently entitled to pension if leaving service. 
 (c) For members of the company s pension plan, the annual benefits include the amount of the accrued annual lifetime pension from the company s registered pension plan and supplemental pension arrangement that would be earned to age 65 assuming final average earnings as at December 31, 2022. Benefits under the supplemental pension arrangement can be paid as a lump-sum equivalent upon retirement. For members of the Exxon Mobil Corporation s pension plan, the annual benefits include the annual lifetime pension from the tax-qualified and the annual amount calculated under the non-qualified plans that would be earned to age 65 assuming final average earnings as at December 31, 2022.

The value is calculated based on estimated earnings eligible for pension as described previously and Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) as defined by the Canada Revenue Agency, projected to retirement and pro-rated on service to the date of valuation.

For members of the Exxon Mobil Corporation and Esso Australia Pty Ltd. pension plan respectively, the opening and closing defined benefit obligation is defined under GAAP and values are consistent with the valuation performed for accounting purposes for the applicable affiliate plan.

For members of the Exxon Mobil Corporation and Esso Australia Pty Ltd., the value for Non-compensatory change includes the impact of experience not related to earnings or service.
