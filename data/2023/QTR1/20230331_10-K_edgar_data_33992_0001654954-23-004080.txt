BUSINESS . (a) Business Development General As used in this Annual Report, references to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Kingstone Companies, Inc. Kingstone and its subsidiaries. We offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company KICO ), domiciled in the state of New York. KICO is a licensed property and casualty insurance company in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire. KICO is currently offering its property and casualty insurance products in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. In addition, through our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. Cosi ), a multi-state licensed general agency, we access alternative distribution channels. See Distribution below for a discussion of our distribution channels. Cosi receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense paid. Net Cosi revenue is deducted against commission expense and Cosi-related expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, its expenses are not included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below. Recent Developments Developments During 2022 Debt Exchange On December 9, 2022, we entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with several holders (the Exchanging Noteholders of our outstanding 5.50 Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2017 Notes ). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 21,545,000 of the 30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes then outstanding. At the closing of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for, among other things, new 12.0 Senior Notes due December 30, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of 19,950,000 (the 2022 Notes ). Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage Effective July 1, 2022, KICO decreased the top limit of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage from 500,000,000 to 345,000,000, which, at the time, equated to more than a 1-in-100 year storm event according to the primary industry catastrophe model that we follow. 4 Table of Contents A.M. Best Rating In July 2022, A.M. Best downgraded KICO s financial strength rating from B+ (Good) to B (Fair) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from bbb- (Good) to bb (Fair) due to a significant deterioration in KICO s risk-adjusted capitalization. Such deterioration was driven by a sizeable increase in KICO s net probable maximum loss (PML) as a result of its latest reinsurance renewal and a decline in surplus from weather-related losses and dividend payments by KICO in 2022. The outlook for each of these credit ratings was revised to negative from stable . Concurrently, A.M. Best s public rating for Kingstone Companies, Inc. was withdrawn. Developments During 2021 Quota Share Reinsurance Effective December 31, 2021, KICO entered into a 30 quota share reinsurance treaty for its personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023. Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage Effective July 1, 2021, KICO increased the top limit of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage from 485,000,000 to 500,000,000, which, at the time, equated to more than a 1-in-130 year storm event according to the primary industry catastrophe model that we follow. Additionally, effective October 20, 2021, KICO purchased stub coverage to reduce its retention from a catastrophe to 5 million covering the period October 20, 2021 through December 31, 2021. A.M. Best Rating In August 2021, A.M. Best downgraded KICO s financial strength rating from B++ (Good) to B+ (Good) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from bbb (Good) to bbb- (Good) due to a revision of operating performance to adequate from strong which reflects volatility from underwriting results caused by weather-related losses and loss reserve strengthening. The outlook for each of these credit ratings was revised from negative to stable . (b) Business Property and Casualty Insurance Overview Property and casualty insurance companies provide policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the insureds ). An insurance policy is a contract between the insurance company and its insureds where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses that are covered under the contract. Such contracts are subject to legal interpretation by courts, sometimes involving legislative rulings and/or arbitration. Property insurance generally covers the financial consequences of accidental losses to the insured s property, such as a home and the personal property in it, or a business owner s building, inventory and equipment. Casualty insurance (also referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences related to the legal liability of an individual or an organization resulting from negligent acts and omissions that cause bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Claims for property coverage generally are reported and settled in a relatively short period of time, whereas those for casualty coverage may take many years to settle. 5 Table of Contents We generate revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from our investment portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. We also collect a variety of policy fees including installment fees, reinstatement fees, and non-sufficient fund fees related to situations involving extended premium payment plans. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the life of the policy). All of our policies are 12 month policies; therefore, a significant period of time can elapse between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earning investment income and generating net realized and unrealized gains and losses on associated investments. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from insured losses, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling insured losses, various loss adjustment expenses LAE are incurred such as insurance adjusters fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition expenses, such as commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including their employees compensation and benefits. The key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company s combined ratio is calculated by taking the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the loss and LAE ratio and adding it to the ratio of policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses to earned premiums (the expense ratio ). A combined ratio under 100 indicates that an insurance company is generating an underwriting profit prior to the impact of investment income. After considering investment income and investment gains or losses, insurance companies operating at a combined ratio of greater than 100 can also be profitable. Business; Strategy We are a multi-line regional property and casualty insurance company writing business exclusively through retail and wholesale agents and brokers producers appointed by our wholly owned subsidiary, KICO. We are licensed to write insurance policies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. We are actively writing business in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Additionally, our subsidiary, Cosi, a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. We seek to deliver an attractive return on capital and to provide consistent earnings growth through underwriting profits and income from our investment portfolio. Our goal is to allocate capital efficiently to those lines of business that generate sustainable underwriting profits and to avoid lines of business for which an underwriting profit is not likely. Our strategy is to be the preferred multi-line property and casualty insurance company for selected producers in the geographic markets in which we operate. We believe producers place profitable business with us because we provide excellent, consistent service to insureds and claimants. Producers also value our financial stability coupled with competitive rate and commission structures. 6 Table of Contents Our principal objectives are to grow profitably while managing risk through prudent use of reinsurance in order to strengthen our capital base. We generate underwriting income through adequate pricing of insurance policies and by effectively managing our other underwriting and operating expenses. We are pursuing profitable growth through existing producers in existing markets, by developing new geographic markets and producer relationships, and by introducing niche products that are relevant to our producers and insureds. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our gross written premiums totaled 201.2 million, an increase of 10.8 from the 181.7 million in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2021. Product Lines Our product lines include the following: Personal lines - Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners and dwelling fire multi-peril, cooperative/condominiums, renters, and personal umbrella policies. Personal lines policies accounted for 93.5 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. Livery physical damage - We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs, primarily based in New York City. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included. These policies accounted for 6.4 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other - We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations. These policies accounted for 0.1 of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our Competitive Strengths Long History of Operations KICO has been in operation in the State of New York for over 135 years. We have consistently sought to grow the amount of profitable business that we write by introducing new products, increasing volume written with our Select producers in existing markets, and developing new producer relationships and markets. KICO has earned an underwriting profit in six of the past ten years, including in 2012 and 2013 when our financial results were adversely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The extensive heritage of our insurance company subsidiary and our commitment to the markets in which we operate is a competitive advantage with producers and insureds. Strong Producer Relationships Within our producers offices, we compete with other property and casualty insurance carriers available to those producers. We carefully select the producers that distribute our insurance policies and continuously monitor and evaluate their performance. We believe our insurance producers value their relationships with us because we provide excellent, consistent personal service coupled with competitive rates and commission levels. We have consistently been rated by insurance producers as above average in the important areas of underwriting, claims handling and service. 7 Table of Contents We offer our Select producers access to a variety of personal lines and specialty products, including some that are unique to us. We provide a multi-policy discount on homeowners policies in order to attract and retain more of this multi-line business. We have had a consistent presence in the New York market and our producers value the longevity of the relationship. We believe that the excellent service provided to our Select producers, our broad product offerings, our competitive prices and our financial stability provide a strong foundation for profitable growth. Sophisticated Pricing, Underwriting and Risk Management Practices We believe that a significant underwriting advantage exists due to our local market presence and expertise. Our underwriting process evaluates and screens out certain risks based on their prior loss experience, cost of reinsurance, property condition, insurance scoring and driving record, and then is augmented by information collected from physical property inspections. We maintain certain policy exclusions that reduce our exposure to risks that can create severe losses. We target a preferred risk profile in order to reduce adverse selection from risks seeking the lowest premiums and minimal coverage levels. Our underwriting procedures, premiums and policy terms support the goal of underwriting profitability of our personal lines policies. We adhere to a quarterly indication process and perform a rate review in each state and for each product at least annually. In 2022, we introduced our new Select homeowners, condo/tenant and dwelling fire programs in New York. This product incorporates by-peril rating and a host of new data sources to better match rate to risk. We have also updated property replacement costs to address inflation. We manage coastal risk exposure through the use of individual catastrophe risk scoring, the inclusion of hurricane deductibles, non-renewals and the prudent use of reinsurance. We measure our risk exposure regularly and adjust our underwriting to manage growth in our probable maximum loss (PML). Effective Utilization of Reinsurance Our reinsurance treaties allow us to limit our exposure to the financial impact of catastrophe losses and to reduce our net liability on individual risks. Our reinsurance program is structured to enable us to grow our premium volume while maintaining regulatory capital and other financial ratios within thresholds used for regulatory oversight purposes. Our reinsurance program also provides income from ceding commissions earned pursuant to quota share reinsurance contracts. The income we earn from ceding commissions subsidizes our fixed operating costs, which consist of other underwriting expenses. Quota share reinsurance treaties transfer a portion of the profit (or loss) associated with the subject insurance policies to the reinsurers. Scalable, Low-Cost Operations We focus on efficiently managing our expenses, and invest in tools and processes that improve the effectiveness of underwriting risks and processing claims. We evaluate the costs and benefits of each new tool or process in order to achieve optimal results. While the majority of our policies are written for risks in downstate New York, our Kingston, New York location provides a low-cost operating environment. We continue to invest in improving our online application and quoting systems for our personal lines products. We have leveraged a paperless workflow management and document storage tool that has improved efficiency and reduced costs. We provide an online payment portal that allows producers and insureds to make payments and to view policy information for all of our products in one location. Our ability to control the growth of operating and other expenses while expanding our operations and growing revenue is a key component of our business model and is important to our financial success. 8 Table of Contents In 2022, we completed the implementation of Kingstone 2.0, an effort to modernize the Company. Kingstone 2.0 included the establishment of a new claims system, the introduction of a new interface for our Select producers and the conversion of all personal lines policies to our new policy management system, among many other initiatives. Underwriting and Claims Management Philosophy Our underwriting philosophy is to target niche segments for which we have detailed expertise and can take advantage of market conditions. We monitor results on a regular basis and our Select producers are reviewed by management on at least a quarterly basis. We believe that our rates are appropriately competitive with other carriers in our target markets. We do not seek to grow by competing based solely upon price. We seek to develop long-term relationships with our Select producers who understand and appreciate the path we have chosen. We carefully underwrite our business utilizing industry claims databases, insurance scoring reports, physical inspection of risks and other individual risk underwriting tools. We write homeowners and dwelling fire business in coastal markets and are cognizant of our exposure to hurricanes. We have mitigated this risk through appropriate catastrophe reinsurance and application of hurricane deductibles. We handle claims fairly while ensuring that coverage provisions and exclusions are properly applied. Our claims and underwriting expertise supports our ability to grow our profitable business. Distribution We generate business through our relationships with over 700 producers. We carefully select our producers by evaluating numerous factors such as their need for our products, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent, product and market knowledge, and agency size. We only distribute through agents and have never sought to distribute our products direct to the consumer. We monitor and evaluate the performance of our producers through periodic reviews of volume and profitability. Our senior executives are actively involved in managing our producer relationships. Each producer is assigned to a staff underwriter and the producer can call that underwriter directly on any matter. We believe that the close relationship and personal service received from their underwriters is a principal reason producers place their business with us. Our producers have access to a KICO producer interface and website portal that provides them the ability to quote risks for various products and to review policy forms and underwriting guidelines for all lines of business. We send out frequent Producer Grams in order to inform our producers of updates at KICO. Competition; Market The insurance industry is highly competitive. We constantly assess and make projections of market conditions and appropriate prices for our products, but we cannot fully know our profitability until all claims have been reported and settled. Our policyholders are located primarily in the downstate regions of New York State, but we have grown into other Northeast markets, including New Jersey and Rhode Island during 2017 followed by Massachusetts in 2018 and Connecticut in 2019. In addition, we are licensed to write insurance policies in Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. In 2022, we made the decision to reduce our footprint outside New York due to profitability concerns. We entered these states to diversify Kingstone s footprint starting in 2017, and they have had a disproportionate impact on our underwriting results, especially in 2022. We have attempted to address these challenges and achieve profitability with a series of rate and underwriting actions, but the impact we have worked towards was largely nullified by inflation. In addition to a new business moratorium in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island, we have been actively non-renewing policies subject to regulatory constraints and have materially lowered commission rates to our producers. These actions should reduce the size of our portfolio outside New York materially. 9 Table of Contents In 2022, KICO was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in the State of New York, according to data compiled by S P Capital IQ. Based on the same data, in 2022, we had a 1.6 market share for this business. We compete with large national carriers as well as regional and local carriers in the property and casualty marketplace in New York and other states. We believe that many national and regional carriers have chosen to limit their rate of premium growth or to decrease their presence in Northeastern states due to the relatively high coastal population and associated catastrophe risk that exists in the region. Additionally, some of our largest competitors historically have stopped writing business this year. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves We are required to establish reserves for unpaid losses, including reserves for claims loss adjustment expenses LAE ), which represent the expenses of settling and adjusting those claims. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. We establish these reserves after considering all information known to us as of the date they are recorded. Loss reserves fall into two categories: case reserves for reported losses and LAE associated with specific reported claims, and reserves for losses and LAE that are incurred but not reported. We establish these two categories of loss reserves as follows: Reserves for reported losses - When a claim is received, we establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of its ultimate settlement and its estimated loss expenses. We establish case reserves based upon the known facts about each claim at the time it is received and we may subsequently adjust case reserves as additional facts and information about the claim develops. IBNR reserves - We also estimate reserves for loss and LAE amounts incurred but not reported IBNR ). IBNR reserves are calculated in bulk as an estimate of ultimate losses and LAE less reported losses and LAE. There are two types of IBNR; the first is a provision for claims that have occurred but are not yet reported or known. We refer to this as Pure IBNR, and due to the fact that we write primarily quickly reported property lines of business, this type of IBNR does not make up a large portion of KICO s total IBNR. The second type of IBNR is a provision for expected future development on known claims, from the evaluation date until the time claims are settled and closed. We refer to this as Case Development IBNR and it makes up the majority of the IBNR that KICO records. Ultimate losses driving the determination of appropriate IBNR levels are projected by using generally accepted actuarial techniques. The liability for loss and LAE represents our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses that are unpaid as of the balance sheet evaluation date. The liability for loss and LAE is estimated on an undiscounted basis, using individual case-based valuations, statistical analyses, and various actuarial procedures. The projection of future claim payments and reporting patterns is based on an analysis of our historical experience, supplemented by analyses of industry loss data. We believe that the reserves for loss and LAE are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims to date. However, because of uncertainty from various sources, including changes in claims settlement patterns and handling procedures, litigation trends, judicial decisions, and economic conditions, actual loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liabilities at the balance sheet date. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reflected in the period in which the estimates are changed. Because of the nature of the business historically written, we believe that we have limited exposure to asbestos and environmental claim liabilities. 10 Table of Contents We engage an independent external actuarial specialist (the Appointed Actuary to opine on our recorded statutory reserves. The Appointed Actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a range and recommended central estimate of IBNR reserve amounts. Our carried IBNR reserves are based on an internal actuarial analysis and reflect management s best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE liabilities, and fall within the range of those determined as reasonable by the Appointed Actuary. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Principal Revenue and Expense Items in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 2 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information and details regarding loss and LAE reserves. Reconciliation of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses The table below shows the reconciliation of loss and LAE on a gross and net basis, reflecting changes in losses incurred and paid losses: Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of period 94,948,745 82,801,228 Less reinsurance recoverables (10,637,679 (20,154,251 Net balance, beginning of period 84,311,066 62,646,977 Incurred related to: Current year 85,690,180 101,987,855 Prior years 2,699,862 (15,259 Total incurred 88,390,042 101,972,596 Paid related to: Current year 49,602,585 60,171,695 Prior years 32,418,510 20,136,812 Total paid 82,021,095 80,308,507 Net balance at end of period 90,680,013 84,311,066 Add reinsurance recoverables 27,659,500 10,637,679 Balance at end of period 118,339,513 94,948,745 Our claims reserving practices are designed to set reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate to pay all claims at their ultimate settlement value. Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development The table below shows the net loss development of reserves held as of each calendar year-end from 2012 through 2022. The first section of the table reflects the changes in our loss and LAE reserves after each subsequent calendar year of development. The table displays the re-estimated values of incurred losses and LAE at each succeeding calendar year-end, including payments made during the years indicated. The second section of the table shows by year the cumulative amounts of loss and LAE payments, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, as of the end of each succeeding year. An example with respect to the net loss and LAE reserves of 12,065,000 as of December 31, 2012 is as follows. By December 31, 2014 (two years later), 8,833,000 had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of December 31, 2012. The re-estimated ultimate reserves two years later for those claims as of December 31, 2012 had grown to 16,875,000. 11 Table of Contents The cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents, as of December 31, 2022, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate. A deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

Participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Our reinsurance program is structured to reflect our obligations and goals. Reinsurance via quota share allows a carrier to write business without increasing its underwriting leverage above a level determined by management. The business written under a quota share reinsurance structure obligates a reinsurer to assume some portion of the risks involved, and gives the reinsurer the profit (or loss) associated with such in exchange for a ceding commission. Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 2021/2023 Treaty ). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 2023/2024 Treaty ). Excess of loss contracts provide coverage for individual loss occurrences exceeding a certain threshold. The quota share reinsurance treaties inure to the benefit of our excess of loss treaties, as the maximum net retention on any single risk occurrence is first limited through the excess of loss treaty, and then that loss is shared again through the quota share reinsurance treaty. Our maximum net retention under the quota share and excess of loss treaties for any one personal lines occurrence for dates of loss on or after December 31, 2020 through December 30, 2021 was 1,000,000. Effective December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023, our maximum net retention under the 2021/2023 Treaty decreased to 700,000. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty Underlying XOL Treaty covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying XOL Treaty provides 50 reinsurance coverage for losses, other than from a named storm, of 400,000 in excess of 600,000. Our maximum net retention for any one personal lines occurrence is further reduced from 700,000 to 500,000. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. Our maximum net retention under the excess of loss treaties for any one commercial general liability occurrence for dates of loss on or after July 1, 2020 is 750,000. We previously earned ceding commission revenue under the quota share reinsurance treaties based on a provisional commission rate on all premiums ceded to the reinsurers as adjusted by a sliding scale based on the ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each agreement. The sliding scale provided minimum and maximum ceding commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. Under the 2021/2023 Treaty, KICO received a fixed provisional rate with no adjustment for sliding scale contingent commissions. Under the 2023/2024 Treaty, KICO will receive a fixed provisional rate with no adjustment for sliding scale contingent commissions. The 2021/2023 Treaty and 2023/2024 Treaty are on a net of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the gross arrangement that existed in prior treaties. Under a net arrangement, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased directly by us. Since we pay for all of the catastrophe coverage, none of the losses covered under a catastrophic event will be included in the quota share ceded amounts. In 2022, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance to provide coverage of up to 345,000,000 for losses associated with a single event. One of the most commonly used catastrophe forecasting models prepared for us indicates that the catastrophe reinsurance treaties provide coverage in excess of our estimated probable maximum loss associated with a single more than one-in-100 year storm event. Effective October 18, 2021, we entered into a stub catastrophe reinsurance treaty Stub Treaty covering the period from October 18, 2021 through December 31, 2021. The Stub Treaty provided reinsurance coverage for catastrophe losses of 5,000,000 in excess of 5,000,000. The Stub Treaty reduced direct retention to 5,000,000 during the period it was in effect. Effective December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023, losses on personal lines policies are subject to the 2021/2023 Treaty, which covered 26 of catastrophe losses and resulted in a net retention by us of 7,400,000 of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. Effective January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024, losses on personal lines policies are subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty, which will cover 12.5 of catastrophe losses and will result in a net retention by us of 8,750,000 of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, we had reinstatement premium protection on the first 70,000,000 layer of catastrophe coverage in excess of 10,000,000. Effective July 1, 2022 and through June 30, 2023, we have reinstatement premium protection for 9,800,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of 10,000,000. This protects us from having to pay an additional premium to reinstate catastrophe coverage for an event up to this level. 13 Table of Contents See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Principal Revenue and Expense Items in Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 2 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Ratings Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business and from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. A.M. Best financial strength ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company s balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company s capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. A.M. Best financial strength ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors. KICO has a financial strength rating from A.M. Best of B (Fair). The Company s previous ratings from A.M. Best (for Kingstone Companies, Inc.) and Kroll Rating Agency were withdrawn at the request of the Company. Other ratings assigned to KICO and previously assigned to Kingstone by A.M. Best and Kroll Bond Rating Agency were as follows: Kingstone KICO Companies A.M. Best Long-Term issuer credit rating (ICR) bb (negative outlook) b- (negative outlook) A.M. Best Long-Term issue credit rating (IR) 30.0 million, 5.50 senior unsecured notes due Dec. 30, 2022 n/a bb- (stable outlook) Kroll Bond Rating Agency insurance financial strength rating (IFSR) BBB+ (negative outlook) n/a Kroll Bond Rating Agency issuer rating n/a BB+ (negative outlook) Catastrophe Losses In 2022 we had catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than 25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers. Our predominant market, downstate New York, was affected by several events during 2022, none of which were named storms. The effects of catastrophes during 2022 increased our net loss ratio by 6.7 percentage points in such year. Our predominant market, downstate New York, was affected by several events during 2021, including three named storms. The remnants of Hurricane Ida, included as one of the named storms, increased our loss ratio by 7.1 percentage points. The effects of this catastrophe and other catastrophes during 2021 increased our net loss ratio by 10.3 percentage points in such year. 14 Table of Contents Government Regulation Holding Company Regulation We, as the parent of KICO, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of New York. These laws generally require an insurance company to register with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the DFS and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within our holding company system. Generally, under these laws, all material transactions among companies in the holding company system to which KICO is a party must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or acknowledgement (absence of disapproval) by the DFS. Change of Control The insurance holding company laws of the state of New York require approval by the DFS for any change of control of an insurer. Control is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10 or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company; however, the ownership of less than 10 of such voting securities could constitute control under certain circumstances. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of KICO, including a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the approval of the DFS (and in any other state in which KICO may operate). Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. State Insurance Regulation Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates, and in some instances to regulate unfair trade and claims practices. KICO is required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which it is licensed to transact business. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the insurance regulators. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the insurance regulatory authority. The state regulator may reject a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations, including those in New York, that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of KICO to exit unprofitable markets. Such laws did not affect KICO s ability to withdraw from the commercial liability market in New York State in 2019 and the commercial auto market in New York State in 2015. 15 Table of Contents Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that either have been or are being considered are the possible introduction of Federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers, and proposals in various state legislatures. Some of these proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the NAIC ). In 2017, the DFS implemented new comprehensive cybersecurity regulations, which became effective on March 1, 2017, with transitional implementation periods. The regulations require covered entities, including KICO, to establish a cybersecurity policy, a chief information security officer CISO ), oversight over third party service providers, penetration and vulnerability assessments, secure systems to maintain an audit trail, risk assessments to include access privileges to nonpublic information, use of multi-factor authentication, and an incident response plan, among other provisions. KICO must annually certify compliance to the DFS with the applicable cybersecurity regulatory provisions. Annual certifications are due April 15. Recently, the DFS has provided additional guidance on ransomware, and potential cyber-attacks from Russia s invasion of Ukraine. In October 2022, the DFS issued proposed amendments updating the 2017 cyber regulations. The amendments would require all covered entities written cybersecurity policy be approved at least annually by the body s directors or committee thereof, require that a covered entity s CISO have sufficient authority to ensure that cybersecurity risks are appropriately managed, and require the CISO to report material cybersecurity issues. Covered entities would be further required under the amendments to implement asset inventory management, develop and implement a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, and maintain backups protected from unauthorized alterations or destruction. The proposed regulation updates certain cybersecurity event reporting requirements, including notice and explanation of extortion payments, and amends the April 15 annual reporting requirement to include a written acknowledgment of any areas of noncompliance and remediation plans signed by the entity s highest-ranking executive and CISO. Finally, the proposed regulation updates the factors the Superintendent may consider in assessing violations. In 2010 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act became law. It established a Federal Insurance Office (the FIO within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO is initially charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. In December 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States , which stated that, given the uneven progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, Congress should strongly consider direct federal involvement. The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers.) In its September 2022 Annual Report on the Insurance Industry (the Report ), the FIO provided an overview of its statutory responsibilities and its role. The Report then summarized the FIO s key activities since those described in its prior Annual Report on the Insurance Industry. The Report observed that, in 2021, the property/casualty sector direct premium written was 798 billion, a 9 growth over 2020 levels, the highest annual growth in the past decade. In September 2021, the FIO issued a Preemption Report. This document noted that during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, FIO did not take any action regarding the preemption of any state insurance measures that were inconsistent with a covered agreement. In addition to reviewing the financial status of the property/casualty industry, the Report includes Topical Updates and FIO activities, climate change, mitigation and resilience and Cyber Risks, Ransomware, and Cyber Insurance. 16 Table of Contents On December 20, 2020, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 was enacted and is now scheduled to expire on December 31, 2027. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program serves as a federal backstop for insurance claims related to acts of terrorism. On November 15, 2021, the DFS issued its final Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers On Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change. On June 15, 2022, the DFS released its 2021 annual report. The report references the creation of a standalone Climate Division, which was the source of the aforementioned guidance. In 2021, the Governor of the State of New York signed into law, effective January 28, 2022 and subsequently clarified by law taking effect March 15, 2023, legislation that seeks to prevent homeowner insurers from discriminating solely on the basis of breed of dog. In 2021, the Comprehensive Insurance Disclosure Act was enacted in New York State. This law, as amended by a subsequent chapter amendment, requires any defendant to provide to the plaintiff, within a limited timeframe, proof of existence and the contents of any insurance agreement under which any person or entity may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment and details what the information and documentation includes. The new law applies to actions commenced on or after December 31, 2021. In 2022, the New York legislature passed legislation to greatly expand wrongful death actions. This bill sought to expand the categories of claimants and scope of losses for which a wrongful death lawsuit could be brought. The bill was vetoed in January 2023, but observers suspect the substance of the bill may reappear for future consideration. State Regulatory Examinations As part of their regulatory oversight process, state regulatory authorities conduct periodic detailed examinations of the financial reporting of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance regulators of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. The DFS has notified KICO that it will commence an examination of KICO in 2023 for the years 2019 through 2022. Risk-Based Capital Regulations State regulatory authorities impose risk-based capital RBC requirements on insurance enterprises. The RBC Model serves as a benchmark for the regulation of insurance companies. RBC provides for targeted surplus levels based on formulas, which specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk, and are set forth in the RBC requirements. Such formulas focus on four general types of risk: (a) the risk with respect to the company s assets (asset or default risk); (b) the risk of default on amounts due from reinsurers, policyholders, or other creditors (credit risk); (c) the risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the coming year (underwriting risk); and (d) the risk associated with items such as excessive premium growth, contingent liabilities, and other items not reflected on the balance sheet (off-balance sheet risk). The amount determined under such formulas is called the authorized control level RBC ACL ). 17 Table of Contents The RBC guidelines define specific capital levels based on a company s ACL that are determined by the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital TAC to its ACL. TAC is equal to statutory capital, plus or minus certain other specified adjustments. KICO s TAC is above the ACL and is in compliance with New York s RBC requirements as of December 31, 2022. Dividend Limitations Our ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Dividends may be paid, without the need for DFS approval, from unassigned surplus and are restricted to the lesser of 10 of surplus or 100 of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends by KICO paid during such period. See Item 5 Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividends of this Annual Report for a further discussion as to KICO s ability to pay dividends to us. Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios The Insurance Regulatory Information System IRIS was developed by the NAIC and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in meeting their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business. As of December 31, 2022, KICO had three ratios outside the usual range. Accounting Principles Statutory accounting principles SAP are a basis of accounting developed by the NAIC. They are used to prepare the statutory financial statements of insurance companies and to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s policyholder surplus. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state. Generally accepted accounting principles GAAP are concerned with a company s solvency, but are also concerned with other financial measurements, principally results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different types and amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP. Statutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted in part by New York insurance regulators determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of KICO and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available for KICO to pay dividends to Kingstone Companies, Inc. 18 Table of Contents Legal Structure We were incorporated in 1961 and assumed the name DCAP Group, Inc. in 1999. On July 1, 2009, we changed our name to Kingstone Companies, Inc. Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had 95 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

The inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this Annual Report. ITEM 1A . RISK FACTORS . Based upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Risks Related to Our Business The impact of pandemics and other public health issues (like COVID-19) and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. Beginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to COVID-19 began to impact the global economy and our results of operations. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include, among others, the following: Investments. The disruption in the financial markets related to COVID-19 has contributed to net investment losses, primarily due to the impact of changes in fair value on our equity investments and in our fixed-income investment portfolio. Our corporate fixed income portfolio may be adversely impacted by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in distressed industries. In addition, in recent years, many state and local governments have been operating under deficits or projected deficits. These deficits may be exacerbated by the costs of responding to COVID-19 and reduced tax revenues due to adverse economic conditions. The severity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio. Our investment portfolio also includes mortgage-backed securities which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption. Further disruptions in global financial markets could adversely impact our net investment income in future periods. 19 Table of Contents Adverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of pandemic and other public health issues (like COVID-19) may adversely affect us. For example, we may be subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses which our insurance policies were not designed or priced to cover. Currently, in some states there is proposed legislation to require insurers to cover business interruption claims irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in the policies that would otherwise preclude coverage. Regulatory restrictions or requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel or non-renew policies and our right to collect premiums. Operational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our producers are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, the interruption of our or their system capabilities could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. Having shifted to remote working arrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events. Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events and other severe weather events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We currently have catastrophe reinsurance coverage with regard to losses of up to 345,000,000 335,000,000 in excess of 10,000,000). Effective January 1, 2023, 10,000,000 of losses in a catastrophe are subject to a quota share reinsurance treaty, which covers 12.5 of catastrophe losses such that we retain 8,750,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With respect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to 335,000,000, we are 100 reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred, (ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage limits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions of future reinsurance treaties. In addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur. 20 Table of Contents Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car prices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to enforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The financial strength rating assigned to our insurance subsidiary will impact our revenues and earnings. Financial strength ratings are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies. The objective of the rating agencies rating systems is to provide an opinion as to an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. The ratings of Kingstone Insurance Company KICO ), our insurance subsidiary, reflect the rating agencies opinion as to its financial strength and are not evaluations directed to investors in our securities, nor are they recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Our ratings are subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, the rating agencies. In July 2022, A.M. Best lowered the financial strength rating of KICO from B+ (Good) to B (Fair). The outlook of A.M. Best s credit rating is negative. Concurrently, A.M. Best s public rating for Kingstone Companies, Inc. was withdrawn. Management believes that A.M. Best s financial strength rating is more significant with regard to commercial liability insurance, as opposed to personal lines business. Since we have discontinued our commercial lines business, we believe that A.M. Best s rating action will not result in a material decrease in the amount of business that KICO will be able to write. Also, KICO has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional) which generally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance from highly-rated carriers. However, the prior A.M Best ratings downgrade has resulted in a material decrease in the business of our subsidiary, Cosi, a multi-state licensed general agency that had partnered with name-brand carriers which require an A.M. Best A- rating from its partners. The failure to comply with certain financial covenants could result in a default with regard to our debt due on December 30, 2024. On December 9, 2022, we entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with several holders (the Exchanging Noteholders of our outstanding 5.50 Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2017 Notes ). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 21,545,000 of the 30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes then outstanding. 21 Table of Contents At the closing of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for, among other things, new 12.0 Senior Notes due December 30, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of 19,950,000 (the 2022 Notes ). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we are required to satisfy certain financial covenants, among other covenants, related to our performance. In the event we do not satisfy such covenants, the holders of the 2022 Notes could declare a default and seek to accelerate the due date for payment, among other remedies. We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period. We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic conditions, the performance of the economy in general, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions. Reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business. We purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to protect against possible catastrophes, to remain within a target ratio of net premiums written to policyholders surplus and to expand our underwriting capacity. Participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us on terms and rates that are commercially reasonable. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives. 22 Table of Contents Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Applicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider desirable. We are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc. would require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our stockholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar regulations may apply in other states in which we may operate. The insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes, prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk or delay or prevent our entry into new states. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. Because the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even in the absence of any change to a particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and/or to improve the profitability of our business. 23 Table of Contents While the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets. The New York State Department of Financial Services (the DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting and off-balance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping existing business. Similar regulations apply in other states in which we operate. Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows. We recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance. Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Because substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state. Approximately 81 of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the State of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it costlier or difficult for us to conduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 24 Table of Contents We are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues. We market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 38 brokers provided a total of 40 of our total gross premiums written. The nature of our dependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of the underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these brokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition . Recorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and contractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. As a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary, KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO. We are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations of our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to repay debts, pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our stockholders. State insurance laws limit the ability of KICO to pay dividends from unassigned surplus and require KICO to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. Maximum allowable dividends by KICO to us are restricted to the lesser of 10 of surplus or 100 of net investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2022, KICO could not pay any dividends to us without prior regulatory approval due to negative unassigned surplus of approximately 5,069,000. The aggregate maximum amount of dividends permitted by law to be paid by an insurance company does not necessarily define an insurance company s actual ability to pay dividends. The actual ability to pay dividends may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, by our competitive position and by the amount of premiums that we can write. State insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies. Our ability to pay interest and principal on the 2022 Notes as they come due may be limited by these regulatory constraints. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including the 2022 Notes. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 2022 Notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flows from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. 25 Table of Contents Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive. The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers, agents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Barry Goldstein, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, and Meryl Golden, our Chief Operating Officer and KICO s President. The loss of Mr. Goldstein or Ms. Golden or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Mr. Goldstein and we are parties to an employment agreement which expires on December 31, 2024. Ms. Golden and we are parties to an employment agreement which also expires on December 31, 2024. Difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results. As with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose to purchase lower levels of insurance. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition. Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. Our business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors. Our business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data. Some of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties systems. In the course of our operations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. 26 Table of Contents All of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. While we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber insurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results. We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business. Our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for stockholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business. Stock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock. 27 Table of Contents The trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, stockholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our common stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive. Our common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq ). Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, stockholders have reduced liquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire. There may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Subject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders. We have effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), covering an aggregate of 1,400,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the 2014 Plan ). As of December 31, 2022, options to purchase 107,201 shares of our common stock, and 366,597 shares subject to unvested restricted stock grants, were outstanding under the 2014 Plan and 351,445 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. The shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by our affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, there were also outstanding warrants for the purchase of 969,525 shares of our common stock. The shares issuable pursuant to an exercise of the warrants may be freely tradeable in the public market under certain circumstances. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us, by selling stockholders in future offerings or by our existing stockholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all. In addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, to maintain our capital ratios, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards. 28 Table of Contents Our executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As of March 21, 2023, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 1,119,165 shares of our common stock, representing 10.4 of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other stockholders, and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other stockholders. Anti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our stockholders.

Market Information Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol KINS. Holders As of March 21, 2023, there were 243 record holders of our common stock. Dividends Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We paid a cash dividend in each quarter from September 2011 through September 2022. On November 11, 2022, our Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends in connection with the 2017 Notes refinancing and the need to retain cash to pay a portion of 2017 Notes due on December 30, 2022. Future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that future dividends of any kind will be paid to holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay dividends depends, in part, on the ability of KICO to pay dividends to us. KICO, as an insurance subsidiary, is subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting its ability to declare and pay dividends. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Without the prior approval of the DFS, dividends may be paid from unassigned surplus and are restricted to the lesser of 10 of surplus or 100 of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2022, KICO had a negative unassigned surplus of 5,069,000 and will not be able pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . Overview We offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company KICO ). KICO s insureds are located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, although we are actively writing business in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. We are licensed in the States of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maine, and New Hampshire. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 80.6 of KICO s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. In addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. Cosi ), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense paid Net Cosi Revenue ). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue and Cosi-related operating expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, Cosi s expenses are not included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below. We derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO s insurance policies are written for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums to the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings and may also generate net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on future investments. Our expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses LAE are incurred such as insurance adjusters fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs include commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees compensation and benefits. Other operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company and operating expenses of Cosi. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive employment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company. Cosi operating expenses primarily include employment, occupancy and consulting costs. Principal Revenue and Expense Items Net premiums earned: Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have a term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2022, we would earn half of the premiums in 2022 and the other half in 2023. 31 Table of Contents Ceding commission revenue: Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded to quota share treaties are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. Net investment income and net gains (losses) on investments: We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and equity securities, and other investments. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify our fixed-maturity securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on our balance sheet while our equity securities and other investments report changes in fair value through earnings. See Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our accounting policies following Item 16 of this Annual Report. Other income: We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment. Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred: Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on such claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability. Commission expenses and other underwriting expenses: Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to the underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance business and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy costs, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees. Other operating expenses: Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc., and operating expenses of Cosi. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public company. Cosi operating expenses primarily include employment costs, occupancy costs and consulting costs. 32 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation: Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and amortization of stock options issued to the same. Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO, depreciation of the real estate used in KICO s operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment and furniture. Interest expense: Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the applicable interest rates. Interest expense also includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Income tax expense: We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations as well as state income tax expense for our non-insurance underwriting subsidiaries. Product Lines Our product lines include the following: Personal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and personal umbrella policies. Commercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition, we wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we offered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies. In May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions while we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite commercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of December 31, 2022, these expired policies represent approximately 17.9 of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under Additional Financial Information . Livery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included. Other: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations. Key Measures We utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business: 33 Table of Contents Net loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned. Net underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned. Net combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient. Underwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It excludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not materialize. Application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of similar companies. We believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred income taxes, the impairment of investment securities, and the valuation of warrants. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements following Item 16 of this Annual Report. 34 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Percent Revenues Direct written premiums 201,255 181,665 19,590 10.8 Assumed written premiums - - - na 201,255 181,665 19,590 10.8 Ceded written premiums Ceded to quota share treaties (1) 47,409 23,510 23,899 101.7 Ceded to excess of loss treaties 3,880 2,613 1,267 48.5 Ceded to catastrophe treaties 27,906 26,787 1,119 4.2 Total ceded written premiums 79,195 52,910 26,285 49.7 Net written premiums 122,060 128,755 (6,695 (5.2 Change in unearned premiums Direct and assumed (9,733 (7,750 (1,983 (25.6 Ceded to quota share treaties (1) 2,058 22,877 (20,819 (91.0 Change in net unearned premiums (7,675 15,127 (22,802 150.7 Premiums earned Direct and assumed 191,522 173,915 17,607 10.1 Ceded to reinsurance treaties (77,137 (30,033 (47,104 (156.8 Net premiums earned 114,385 143,882 (29,497 (20.5 Ceding commission revenue (1) 19,319 90 19,229 21,365.6 Net investment income 4,937 6,621 (1,684 (25.4 Net (losses) gains on investments (9,392 9,787 (19,179 na Other income 910 851 59 6.9 Total revenues 130,159 161,231 (31,072 (19.3 Expenses Loss and loss adjustment expenses Direct and assumed: Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 114,943 87,308 27,635 31.7 Losses from catastrophes (2) 13,106 15,632 (2,526 (16.2 Total direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 128,048 102,940 25,109 24.4 Ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses: Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 34,185 155 34,030 21,954.8 Losses from catastrophes (2) 5,474 813 4,661 573.3 Total ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 39,658 968 38,691 3,996.9 Net loss and loss adjustment expenses: Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 80,758 87,153 (6,395 (7.3 Losses from catastrophes (2) 7,632 14,819 (7,187 (48.5 Net loss and loss adjustment expenses 88,390 101,973 (13,582 (13.3 Commission expense 34,582 33,114 1,468 4.4 Other underwriting expenses 26,697 26,254 443 1.7 Other operating expenses 3,113 4,183 (1,070 (25.6 Depreciation and amortization 3,300 3,290 10 0.3 Interest expense 2,019 1,826 193 10.6 Total expenses 158,102 170,640 (12,538 (7.3 Loss before taxes (27,942 (9,409 (18,533 (197.0 Income tax benefit (5,418 (2,031 (3,387 (166.8 Net loss (22,525 (7,378 (15,147 (205.3 (Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding) (1) Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a 30 personal lines quota share treaty. (2) The years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than 25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers. 35 Table of Contents Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Percentage Point Change Percent Change Key ratios: Net loss ratio 77.3 70.9 6.4 9.0 Net underwriting expense ratio 36.0 40.6 (4.6 (11.3 Net combined ratio 113.3 111.5 1.8 1.6 Direct Written Premiums Direct written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended 2022 were 201,255,000 compared to 181,665,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended 2021 ). The increase of 19,590,000, or 10.8 , was primarily due an increase in premiums from our personal lines business. Direct written premiums from our personal lines business for Year Ended 2022 were 188,105,000, an increase of 16,385,000, or 9.5 , from 171,720,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to rate increases, offset by a modest decrease in policies in force as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Direct written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Year Ended 2022 were 12,993,000, an increase of 3,276,000, or 33.7 , from 9,717,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to the declining effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in our geographic area. Beginning in 2017 we started writing homeowners policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. We refer to our New York business as our Core business and the business outside of New York as our Expansion business. Direct written premiums from our Core business were 162,255,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 144,449,000 in Year Ended 2021. Direct written premiums from our Expansion business were 39,000,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 37,216,000 in Year Ended 2021. Net Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 2021/2023 Treaty ). There was no quota share reinsurance treaty in effect in Year Ended 2021. Net written premiums decreased 6,695,000, or 5.2 , to 122,060,000 in Year Ended 2022 from 128,755,000 in Year Ended 2021. Net written premiums include direct and assumed premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). In Year Ended 2022, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties increased by 23,899,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Year Ended 2021 (see table above). Our personal lines business was subject to the 2021/2023 Treaty in Year Ended 2022, compared to no personal lines quota share treaty in Year Ended 2021. 36 Table of Contents Excess of loss reinsurance treaties An increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Year Ended 2022, our ceded excess of loss reinsurance premiums increased by 1,267,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Year Ended 2021. The increase was due to an increase in subject premiums and additional coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50 reinsurance coverage for losses of 400,000 in excess of 600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the treaty. Catastrophe reinsurance treaties Most of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase. This results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties provided that reinsurance rates are stable or are increasing. In Year Ended 2022, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties increased by 1,119,000 over the comparable ceded premiums in Year Ended 2021. Effective July 1, 2020, and continuing through June 30, 2021, our ceded catastrophe premiums were paid based on the total insured value of our risks calculated as of August 31, 2020. Effective July 1, 2021, and continuing through June 30, 2022, our ceded catastrophe premiums were paid based on the total insured value of our risks as of August 31, 2021. Effective July 1, 2022, and continuing through June 30, 2023, our ceded catastrophe premiums will be paid based on the total insured value of our risks as of August 31, 2022. Net premiums earned Net premiums earned decreased 29,497,000, or 20.5 , to 114,385,000 in Year Ended 2022 from 143,882,000 in Year Ended 2021. The decrease was due to the inception of the 2021/2023 Treaty on December 31, 2021. The decrease resulting from the 2021/2023 Treaty in Year Ended 2022 was partially offset by an increase in direct written premiums. Ceding Commission Revenue The following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Percent Provisional ceding commissions earned 19,106 234 18,872 8,065.0 Contingent ceding commissions earned 214 (144 358 n/a Total ceding commission revenue 19,319 90 19,229 21,365.6 (Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding) Ceding commission revenue was 19,319,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 90,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase of 19,229,000 was due to an increase in both provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned. 37 Table of Contents Provisional Ceding Commissions Earned In Year Ended 2022 we earned provisional ceding commissions from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023 Treaty which was effective as of December 31, 2021. There was no personal lines quota share in effect in Year Ended 2021. Contingent Ceding Commissions Earned The structure of the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional contingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to the losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received. Net Investment Income Net investment income was 4,937,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 6,621,000 in Year Ended 2021, a decrease of 1,684,000, or 25.4 . The decrease in investment income is partially attributable to a 766,000 reversal of prior years estimated accrued interest income stemming from an error in third party investment reporting. The decline of investment income is also attributable to the disposal of income bearing equity securities. The average yield on invested assets was 3.42 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 3.25 as of December 31, 2021. Cash and invested assets were 191,046,000 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 237,885,000 as of December 31, 2021. The 46,839,000 decrease in cash and invested assets was primarily attributable to cash paid to reinsurers at the inception of the 2021/2023 Treaty, losses paid in connection with catastrophe losses incurred in 2021 and 2022 and unrealized losses on our investment portfolio. Net (Losses) Gains on Investments Net losses on investments were (9,392,000) in Year Ended 2022 compared to net gains of 9,787,000 in Year Ended 2021. Unrealized losses on our equity securities and other investments in Year Ended 2022 were (9,252,000), compared to net unrealized gains of 2,469,000 in Year Ended 2021. Realized losses on sales of investments were (140,000) in Year Ended 2022 compared to realized gains of 7,318,000 in Year Ended 2021. Other Income Other income was 910,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 851,000 in Year Ended 2021, an increase of 59,000, or 6.9 . Net Loss and LAE Net loss and LAE was 88,390,000 for Year Ended 2022 compared to 101,973,000 for Year Ended 2021. The net loss ratio was 77.3 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 70.9 in Year Ended 2021, an increase of 6.4 percentage points. 38 Table of Contents The following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components excluding commercial lines business: (Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding) The loss ratio for Year Ended 2022 was higher than Year Ended 2021 due to two factors. The predominant reason was the impact from climbing inflation leading to higher severity of claim settlements. A slightly elevated frequency of water damage claims was also observed, partially driven by winter-related claims resulting from freezing temperatures. The estimated net catastrophe losses were 7,632,000 for Year Ended 2022, which contributed 6.7 points to the loss ratio. This was mostly driven by two winter events in the first quarter and one winter event (Winter Storm Elliott) in the fourth quarter. There were also another seven minor wind catastrophe events for Year Ended 2022, but the impact was not significant. As a comparison, catastrophe events had a loss ratio impact of 10.3 points for Year Ended 2021 due to a more active hurricane season including the named storm, Ida. Prior years in total have unfavorable development of 2,700,000 for Year Ended 2022, driven mostly by large fire losses which occurred in 2021 and the volatility of liability claim settlements from the discontinued commercial multi-peril line. This contributed 2.4 points to the loss ratio. See table below under Additional Financial Information summarizing net loss ratios by line of business. 39 Table of Contents Commission Expense Commission expense was 34,582,000 in Year Ended 2022 or 18.1 of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was 33,114,000 in Year Ended 2021 or 19.0 of direct earned premiums. The increase of 1,468,000 was primarily due to an increase in direct earned premiums of 17,607,000 to 191,522,000 offset in part by a reduction of commission rate on our Select products and the reduction to contingent commissions, which the producers now earn only if KICO has an operating profit. Other Underwriting Expenses Other underwriting expenses were 26,697,000, or 13.9 of direct earned premiums, in Year Ended 2022 compared to 26,254,000, or 15.1 of direct earned premiums, in Year Ended 2021. The increase of 443,000, or 1.7 , was primarily due to increases in expenses related to our growth in direct earned premiums, salaries, and our continuing initiative to reduce expenses with the use of technology, partially offset by decreases in professional fees, state insurance department fees, and policy management system fees as result of the completion of customized efficient policy management software which allowed us to eliminate multiple legacy systems. Our largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of 10,799,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 10,189,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase of 610,000, or 6.0 , compares favorably with the 10.8 increase in direct written premiums. In the periods following Year Ended 2021, we invested in the hiring of higher-level managers and staff to implement our goals of modernization and efficiency, which we refer to as Kingstone 2.0. Our net underwriting expense ratio in Year Ended 2022 was 36.0 compared to 40.6 in Year Ended 2021. The following table shows the individual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, Percentage 2022 2021 Point Change Other underwriting expenses Employment costs 9.4 7.1 2.3 Underwriting fees (inspections/surveys) 1.7 1.3 0.4 IT expenses 3.9 3.2 0.7 Professional fees 1.3 1.2 0.1 Other expenses 7.0 5.5 1.5 Total other underwriting expenses 23.3 18.3 5.0 Commission expense 30.2 23.0 7.2 Ceding commission revenue Provisional (16.7 (0.2 (16.5 Contingent (0.2 0.1 (0.3 Total ceding commission revenue (16.9 (0.1 (16.8 Other income (0.7 (0.6 (0.1 Net underwriting expense ratio 36.0 40.6 (4.6 (Components may not sum to totals due to rounding) 40 Table of Contents The overall 16.8 percentage point increase in the benefit from ceding commissions in Year Ended 2022 was driven by the increase in provisional ceding commission revenue due to the inception of the 2021/2023 Treaty on December 31, 2021. The components of our net underwriting expense ratio related to other underwriting expenses and commissions increased due to a higher percentage of our direct earned premiums in Year Ended 2022 being ceded due to the inception of the 2021/2023 Treaty. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company and Cosi, were 3,113,000 for Year Ended 2022 compared to 4,183,000 for Year Ended 2021. The following table shows a breakdown of the significant components of other operating expenses for the periods indicated: Years ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Change Percent Other operating expenses Employment costs (24 795 (819 na Bonuses - - - na Equity compensation 1,393 1,905 (512 (26.9 Professional 411 348 63 18.1 Professional fees related to a previously contemplated acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Kingstone 354 - 354 na Directors fees 327 327 - - Insurance 154 212 (58 (27.4 Other expenses 499 597 (98 (16.4 Total other operating expenses 3,114 4,183 (1,069 (25.6 (Components may not sum to totals due to rounding) 41 Table of Contents The decrease in Year Ended 2022 of 1,069,000, or 25.6 , as compared to Year Ended 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in employment costs. The decrease in employment costs was due to staff reductions and fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio. The decrease in employment costs was partially offset by an increase in professional fees attributable to a non-binding indication of interest from a third party related to a then contemplated acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of our company. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization was 3,300,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 3,290,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase of 10,000, or 0.3 , in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to assets previously put into service that are currently being utilized and being fully depreciated. The increase was partially offset by the completion of customized policy management software, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system. In the last quarter of 2021, due to the extended useful life of assets related to our system platforms, Management determined that such systems, currently put into service, should be depreciated over five years reflecting their expected useful lives as compared to the previous three years. Interest Expense Interest expense in Year Ended 2022 was 2,019,000 compared to 1,826,000 in Year Ended 2021, an increase of 193,000 or 10.6 . In Years Ended 2022 and 2021 we incurred interest expense in connection with the 2017 Notes, our 30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017. In Year Ended 2022, as disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we also incurred debt in the fourth quarter of 2022 with respect to the 2022 Notes and an equipment financing. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit in Year Ended 2022 was 5,418,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 19.4 . Income tax benefit in Year Ended 2021 was 2,031,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6 . Loss before taxes was 27,942,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 9,409,000 in Year Ended 2021. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Year Ended 2022 compared to Year Ended 2021. 42 Table of Contents Net Loss Net loss was 22,525,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 7,378,000 in Year Ended 2021. The increase in net loss of 15,147,000 was due to the circumstances described above. Additional Financial Information We operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable unobservable inputs ). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority Level 1 ), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities Level 2 ), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority Level 3 ). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 65 and 62 , respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices. 51 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: December 31, 2022 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Estimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Category Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses Fixed-Maturity Securities: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies 18,918,196 (6,928 3 - - - 18,918,196 (6,928 Political subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions 7,970,633 (2,195,273 9 5,170,753 (1,771,494 5 13,141,386 (3,966,767 Corporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 56,910,104 (5,796,994 75 15,172,381 (2,458,985 15 72,082,485 (8,255,979 Residential mortgage and other asset backed securities 10,145,880 (882,664 22 34,753,178 (7,150,803 26 44,899,058 (8,033,467 Total fixed-maturity securities 93,944,813 (8,881,859 109 55,096,312 (11,381,282 46 149,041,125 (20,263,141 December 31, 2021 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Estimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Category Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses Fixed-Maturity Securities: U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and agencies - - - - - - - - Political subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions 6,768,123 (197,984 5 - - - 6,768,123 (197,984 Corporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 17,593,707 (126,926 15 - - - 17,593,707 (126,926 Residential mortgage and other asset backed securities 45,399,451 (489,258 26 2,923,182 (120,344 2 48,322,633 (609,602 Total fixed-maturity securities 69,761,281 (814,168 46 2,923,182 (120,344 2 72,684,463 (934,512 52 Table of Contents There were 155 securities at December 31, 2022 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds are used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the primary source of cash flow for our holding company was the dividends received from KICO, subject to statutory restrictions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, KICO paid dividends of 5,250,000 to us. On October 27, 2022, KICO entered a sale-leaseback transaction whereby KICO sold substantially all its information technology assets for approximately 8,100,000. Subsequent to the closing of the sale-leaseback transaction, KICO paid a dividend of 3,000,000 to us. In addition, on October 17, 2022 we entered into a seven year loan agreement with KICO with regard to a loan from KICO to us in the amount of 6,450,000. As of December 31, 2022, KICO had a negative unassigned surplus of 5,069,000 and will not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. KICO is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY ), which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 Investments to our consolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5 of KICO s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is September 30, 2022, and are due and payable within 90 days of borrowing. The maximum allowable advance as of December 31, 2022, based on the net admitted assets as of September 30, 2022, was approximately 13,192,000. Available collateral as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 12,228,000. Advances are limited to 85 of the amount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. 53 Table of Contents On December 15, 2022, we issued 19,950,000 of our 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. We are required to make a mandatory redemption of 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023 as discussed in Note 9 Debt of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing of reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments. Cash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are shown in the following table: Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash flows (used in) provided by: Operating activities (915,521 24,346,237 Investing activities (5,905,779 (15,947,862 Financing activities (5,511,070 (3,571,519 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (12,332,370 4,826,856 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 24,290,598 19,463,742 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 11,958,228 24,290,598 Net cash used in operating activities was 916,000 in Year Ended 2022 as compared to 24,346,000 provided by operating activities in Year Ended 2021. The 25,262,000 decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in Year Ended 2022 as compared to Year Ended 2021 was primarily the result of a decrease in cash arising from net fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of 4,073,000. The increase in cash used in operating activities is also attributable to the payment of 13,245,000 to reinsurers in Year Ended 2022 pursuant to the inception of our quota share reinsurance treaty, effective December 31, 2021. In addition, the increase of reinsurance recoverables by 26,173,000 also contributed to the increase in cash used during Year Ended 2022. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations, payments on claims and other changes, which are described above. Net cash used investing activities was 5,906,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 15,948,000 used in investing activities in Year Ended 2021. In Year Ended 2022, we had net investing activity used in our investment portfolio of 1,355,000, compared to 11,449,000 used in Year Ended 2021 resulting in a 10,094,000 decrease in net cash used investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was 5,511,000 in Year Ended 2022 compared to 3,572,000 used in Year Ended 2021. The 1,939,000 increase in net cash used in financing activities was attributable to a 10,050,000 principal payment on the 2017 Notes and 1,758,000 of bond issue costs, both paid in connection with the Exchange Agreement. In addition, we paid 192,000 of principal payments on our equipment financing in connection with KICO s sale-leaseback transaction and there was a 186,000 increase in the amount of withholding taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock awards. The increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by 8,097,000 of proceeds from equipment financing in connection with KICO s sale-leaseback transaction and a decrease of 1,672,000 in the purchase of treasury stock. 54 Table of Contents Reinsurance The following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10 of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2022: Amount Recoverable in thousands) A.M.

Inflation Premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts. We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings. 57 Table of Contents Fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation. Year Ended 2022 included elevated economic inflation, which resulted in a significant increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower public equity valuations, and significant financial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads reduced the value of our fixed income securities, which lowered our stockholders equity materially for Year Ended 2022. The higher economic inflation impacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively impact our profitability. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, or liquidity that are material to investors. Outlook The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant financial market volatility, economic uncertainty, and interruptions to normal business activities. As of the date of this Annual Report, we expect the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on claims currently under our coverages to be manageable, based on the information presently available. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variant strains, continue to evolve and we cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital position, the value of investments we hold in our investment portfolio, the premiums we charge, the demand for our products, our ability to collect premiums or any requirement to return premiums to our policyholders will ultimately be impacted. The impact of COVID-19 on our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 may not be indicative of its impact on our future results. For additional information on the risks posed by COVID-19, see The impact of pandemics and other public health issues (like COVID-19) and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity included in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report. Our net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written premiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. As a result of COVID-19, economic conditions in the United States rapidly deteriorated. The decreased levels of economic activity negatively impacted premium volumes generated by new business. We began to experience this impact in March 2020 and it became more significant in the second and third quarters of 2020. While we are now seeing a reversal of this impact, it may resume in the future, but the degree of any new impact will depend on the extent and duration of any economic contraction and could be material. We have also made underwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return. This action has led, and may continue to lead, to a slowdown in premium growth, particularly in new business. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A .

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter to which this Annual Report relates that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Inherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 59 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kingstone Companies, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. F-2 Table of Contents Evaluation of the Estimate of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense LAE Reserves As discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements, the loss and LAE reserves represent the Company s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses. These reserves are based on facts and circumstances then known and include provisions for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported IBNR ). The projection of future claim payments and reporting is based on analyses of the Company s historical experience, supplemented by analyses of industry loss data. At December 31, 2022, the Company s loss and LAE reserves balance was approximately 118.3 million. Due to the significance of the reserves to the Company s financial statements and the inherent judgment necessary to estimate reserves, we determined that the liability for loss and LAE reserves was a critical audit matter, which required significant auditor judgment and specialized skill and knowledge. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit The primary procedures we performed to address the Company s loss and LAE reserves included, but were not limited to, testing the Company s reserving process, including the actuarial analyses and the determination of the Company s estimate of the loss and LAE reserves as follows: Utilizing consulting actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to analyze the appropriateness of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate reserves and to determine the reasonableness of the gross and net loss and LAE reserves recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2022. Having consulting actuarial professionals also analyze the approach, methodology, assumptions, and ultimate losses and LAE documented in the actuarial reports prepared by the independent actuarial firm engaged by the Company. Analyzing the consistency of the Company s recorded reserves relative to the central estimates of the reserve range determined by the Company s independent actuarial firm at December 31, 2022 in comparison to December 31, 2021. Performing hindsight analysis to determine the completeness and accuracy of reserves recorded in the prior year and performing analytical procedures on current year reserves. Analyzing the 2022 quarterly actuarial reports prepared by the Company s Chief Actuary. Analyzing the 2022 quarterly reports on claims quality assurance prepared by the Company s external claims consultant and the December 31, 2022 reports on unpaid claim liabilities prepared by the independent actuarial firm engaged by the Company. Testing the claims handling process, including the establishment of individual case reserves and the settlement of claims. Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the data provided to the independent actuarial firm engaged by the Company for the purpose of preparing the actuarial report at December 31, 2022. /s/ Marcum llp March 31, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2012 .

The Company reviews its real estate assets used as its headquarters to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for market changes due to declines in the estimated fair value of the property. In evaluating potential impairment, management considers the current estimated fair value compared to the carrying value of the asset.

The collateral is held in a hold-in-custody arrangement with a third party who maintains physical possession of the collateral on behalf of the bank. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding premiums receivable balance is generally diversified due to the large number of individual insureds comprising the Company s customer base. The Company also has receivables from its reinsurers. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company of its obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company periodically evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. See Note 7- Reinsurance for reinsurance recoverables on unpaid and paid losses by reinsurer. Management s policy is to review all outstanding receivables quarterly as well as the bad debt write-offs experienced in the past and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts, if deemed necessary.

The Company regularly reviews its fixed-maturity securities to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in the estimated fair value of investments. In evaluating potential impairment, GAAP specifies (i) if the Company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (ii) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment OTTI of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in comprehensive (loss) income. The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security based on cash flow projections. For held-to-maturity fixed-maturity securities, the amount of OTTI recorded in comprehensive (loss) income for the noncredit portion of a previous OTTI is amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security based on timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.

Prior year incurred loss and LAE development is based upon estimates by line of business and accident year. Prior year loss and LAE development incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was unfavorable and favorable, respectively. Loss and LAE reserves The reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses and LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred but that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity and frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level tail factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external factors that are beyond the Company s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces carried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business, accident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the case reserve is determined by the claims department and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a review of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and development on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions. Since this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in the carried loss reserves. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are recomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods. Several methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the following: Paid Loss Development historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves. Incurred Loss Development historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project future incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves. Paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson BF an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident year claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where an unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.

Stock Options Effective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the 2014 Plan pursuant to which a maximum of shares of Common Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses.

Such amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other operating expenses. No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of stock options at the grant date are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company s stock options. A summary of stock option activity under the Company s 2014 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: - Granted - - - Exercised - - - Expired/Forfeited - - - Outstanding at December 31, 2022 - Vested and Exercisable at December 31, 2022 - The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2022 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of the Company s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on December 31, 2022. No options were exercised, forfeited or expired during the year ended December 31, 2022. The total intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture. The total intrinsic value of options when expired are determined as of the date of expiration. Participants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised, or by exchanging a number of shares owned for a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised.
