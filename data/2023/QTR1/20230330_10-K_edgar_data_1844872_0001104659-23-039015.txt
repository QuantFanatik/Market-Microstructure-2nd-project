Exhibit 34.1 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the Board of Directors of New Holland
Credit Company, LLC 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that New Holland Credit
Company, LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s
Regulation AB for the asset backed securities transactions related to the trusts listed on Appendix A (the Platform as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122 (d)(1)(iv), 1122 (d)(2)(ii), 1122 (d)(2)(iii), 1122
(d)(2)(vi), 1122 (d)(4)(x), 1122 (d)(4)(xi), 1122 (d)(4)(xii), 1122 (d)(4)(xiii), and 1122 (d)(4)(xv), (the Criteria which
the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this
report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations
of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that
may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected
transactions or any other transactions. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of
New Holland Credit Company, LLC, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements
related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As described in management s assertion,
for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) and 1122 (d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required
by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in
Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it
has policies 

and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect
to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, management s assertion
that the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation
AB, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) and 1122 (d)(4)(i) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described
above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed
transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and
determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the
Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the
Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated,
in all material respects.
