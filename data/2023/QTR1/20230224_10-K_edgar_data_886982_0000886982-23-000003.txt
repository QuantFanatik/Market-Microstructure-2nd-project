 Introduction

Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas. 
 When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, we, us and our, we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term our subsidiaries, we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc. References to this Form 10-K are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. All references to 2022, 2021 and 2020 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
 Group Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank. 
 Our Business Segments 
 We manage and report our activities in three business segments: Global Banking Markets, Asset Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Global Banking Markets generates revenues from investment banking fees, including advisory, and equity and debt underwriting fees, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) intermediation and financing activities and Equities intermediation and financing activities, as well as relationship lending and acquisition financing (and related hedges) and investing activities related to our Global Banking Markets activities. Asset Wealth Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, equity investments and debt investments. Platform Solutions generates revenues from consumer platforms, and transaction banking and other platform businesses. 

The chart below presents our three business segments and their revenue sources. 

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2022, we managed and reported our activities in the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer Wealth Management. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, consistent with our previously announced organizational changes, we began managing and reporting our activities in new segments: Global Banking Markets, Asset Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Our new segments reflect the following primary changes: 
 Global Banking Markets is a new segment that includes the results previously reported in Investment Banking and Global Markets, and additionally includes the results from equity and debt investments related to our Global Banking Markets activities, previously reported in Asset Management. 
 Asset Wealth Management is a new segment that includes the results previously reported in Asset Management and Wealth Management (previously included in Consumer Wealth Management), and additionally includes the results from our direct-to-consumer banking business, which includes lending, deposit-taking and investing, previously reported in Consumer Wealth Management, as well as the results from middle-market lending related to our asset management activities, previously reported in Investment Banking. 
 Platform Solutions is a new segment that includes the results from our consumer platforms, such as partnerships offering credit cards and point-of-sale financing, previously reported in Consumer Wealth Management, and the results from our transaction banking business, previously reported in Investment Banking.

Global Banking Markets 
 Global Banking Markets serves public and private sector clients and we seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with our advisory and underwriting activities serving as the main initial point of contact. We make markets and facilitate client transactions in fixed income, currency, commodity and equity products and offer market expertise on a global basis. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Our clients include companies that raise capital and funding to grow and strengthen their businesses, and engage in mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense, restructurings and spin-offs, as well as companies that are professional market participants, who buy and sell financial products and manage risk, and investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash. 
 As a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). 
 We execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs, as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities. 

Through our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including Marquee , and operates globally where markets are open for trading. Marquee provides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes. 
 Our businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research business, which, as of December 2022, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and on approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities. 
 Our activities are organized by asset class and include both cash and derivative instruments. Cash refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). Derivative refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa). 
 Global Banking Markets generates revenues from the following: 
 Investment banking fees. We provide advisory and underwriting services to our clients. 
 Investment banking fees includes the following: 
 Advisory. We have been a leader for many years in providing advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital. 
 Underwriting. We help companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing. Underwriting consists of the following:

In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities.

FICC financing. Includes secured lending to our clients through structured credit and asset-backed lending, including warehouse loans backed by mortgages (including residential and commercial mortgage loans), corporate loans and consumer loans (including auto loans and private student loans). We also provide financing to clients through securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements). 
 Equities. Equities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. 
 Equities intermediation. We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including ETFs, convertible securities, options, futures and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments. As a principal, we facilitate client transactions by providing liquidity to our clients, including by transacting in large blocks of stocks or derivatives, requiring the commitment of our capital. 
 We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information about portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions for our clients. We also work with our clients to create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to establish or liquidate investment positions or undertake hedging strategies. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. 
 Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. 
 We generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. We provide our clients with access to a broad spectrum of equity execution services, including electronic low-touch access and more complex high-touch execution through both traditional and electronic platforms, including Marquee . 
 Equities financing. Includes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. 
 We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting that enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.

 Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s or a separately managed account's return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns.

 Our Business Continuity Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or of our systems, and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

Human Capital Management 
 Our people are our greatest asset. We believe that a major strength and principal reason for our success is the quality, dedication, determination and collaboration of our people, which enables us to serve our clients, generate long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader community. We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 The strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management, as well as the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) is essential to our sustainability. As of December 2022, approximately 57 of our Board was diverse by race, gender or sexual orientation. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we have Inclusion and Diversity Committees across regions, which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people. 
 We believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring and representation goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues. 
 Diverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. For example, we are focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs, such as our Vice President Sponsorship Initiative focused on high-performing women, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian and LGBTQ+ vice presidents across the globe. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analyst Initiative and the Women s Career Strategies Initiative. Our global and regional Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity. 

Progress Toward Aspirational Goals. Reflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 29 women professionals, 24 Asian professionals, 9 Black professionals, 3 Hispanic/Latinx professionals, 3 LGBTQ+ professionals and 3 professionals who are military/veterans. The composition of our most recent managing director class was 30 women professionals, 28 Asian professionals, 5 Black professionals, 5 Hispanic/Latinx professionals, 3 LGBTQ+ professionals and 3 professionals who are military/veterans. 
 We have also set forth the following aspirational goals: 
 We aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70 of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50 women professionals, 11 Black professionals and 14 Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9 Black professionals in the U.K. In 2022, our analyst and associate hires included 44 women professionals, 10 Black professionals and 13 Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 17 Black professionals in the U.K. 
 We aim for women professionals to represent 40 of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 30 of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023, while also endeavoring for women employees to comprise 50 of all of our employees globally over time. As of December 2022, women professionals represented 33 of our vice president population globally and 31 of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K., and women employees represented 41 of all of our employees globally. 
 We aim for Black professionals to represent 7 of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9 of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025. As of December 2022, Black professionals represented 4 of our vice president population in the Americas and 5 in the U.K., and Hispanic/Latinx professionals represented 6 of our vice president population in the Americas. 
 We aim to double the number of campus hires in the U.S. recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by 2025 relative to 2020. 
 The metrics above are based on self-identification. 
 Talent Development and Retention 
 We seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities.

Instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars facilitated by our Learning Engagement team. To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees professional growth and leadership development, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing Director Leadership Acceleration Initiatives and Partner Development Initiative. 
 Enhancing our people s experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we believe that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders. 
 Another important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have also implemented The Three Conversations at GS through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals. 
 We believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and support community organizations through completing local service projects strengthens our people s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2022, our people volunteered approximately 86,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with approximately 17,000 employees partnering with approximately 500 nonprofit organizations on approximately 1,200 community projects. 

Wellness 
 We recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional, lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We provide a number of policies for our employees that support taking time away from the office when needed, including 20 weeks of parental leave, family care leave and bereavement leave. In 2022, we also enhanced our vacation policies for our employees, allowing managing directors to take time off, when needed, without a fixed vacation day entitlement and adding a minimum of two additional vacation days for all other employees, as well as setting a minimum annual expected vacation usage of 15 days. For longer-tenured employees, we offer an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings to enhance access to support, with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our people, and enhancing their effectiveness and productivity. 
 In addition, to support the financial wellness of our employees, we offer a variety of resources that help them manage their personal financial health and decision-making, including financial education information sessions, live and on-demand webinars, articles and interactive digital tools. 
 Global Reach and Strategic Locations 
 As a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2022, we had headcount of 48,500, offices in over 35 countries and 52 of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19 in EMEA and 29 in Asia. Our employees come from over 180 countries and speak more than 150 languages as of December 2022. 
 In addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore, Warsaw and Hyderabad. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence. 
 As of December 2022, 41 of our employees were working in strategic locations. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives.

Sustainability 
 We have a long-standing commitment to sustainability. Our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries decarbonize their businesses to support their transition to a low-carbon economy (Climate Transition) and to advance solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to support sustainable economic growth (Inclusive Growth). Our strategy is to advance these two priorities through our work with our clients, and with strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own, as well as through our supply chain. 
 We have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses, to advance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. We have also created the role of Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities across both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Our sustainable finance-related efforts continue to evolve. For example, we recently launched the Sustainable Banking Group, a group focused on supporting our corporate clients in reducing their direct and indirect carbon emissions. 
 Our activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. We have also implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks, including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Other Risk Management Climate Risk Management in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our climate risk management. 

As a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth for our business. In February 2021, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond of 800 million, and in June 2022 we issued our second benchmark sustainability bond of 700 million. These issuances align with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and fund a range of on-balance sheet sustainable finance activity. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses, including by developing new sustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy 750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2022, we achieved approximately 55 of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition. 
 With respect to Climate Transition, we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net-zero-by-2050 pathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030 focused on three sectors power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing where we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients and investors, deploy capital required for transition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. 
 In addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth where we seek to drive solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to advance sustainable economic growth. We have sponsored initiatives, such as One Million Black Women, Launch With GS, the Urban Investment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses . An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as for our clients and their boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment. See Business Human Capital Management for information about our human capital management goals, programs and policies.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Competition 
 The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors provide investment banking, market-making and asset management services, private banking and lending, commercial lending, point-of-sale financing, credit cards, transaction banking, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, and make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. Our competitors include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. Some of our competitors operate globally and others regionally, and we compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. 
 We have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. 
 Consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S. 
 We also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them. 

A number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing. 
 We also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide. Our competitors may also develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience. 
 The provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 9 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in Regulation below. 
 We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See Regulation Compensation Practices and Risk Factors Competition Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about such regulation. 
 
 Regulation 
 As a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations have been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes. 
 New regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The impacts of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations. 

Group Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator. 
 Under the system of functional regulation established under the GLB Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such functionally regulated subsidiaries include broker-dealers and security-based swap dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities. 
 Our principal subsidiaries operating in the U.S. include GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Co., LLC (GS Co.), J. Aron Company LLC (J. Aron) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. 
 GS Bank USA is our principal U.S. bank subsidiary and is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a London branch, which is regulated by the FCA and PRA, and a Tokyo branch, which is regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency. We conduct a number of our activities partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged lending); securities-based and collateralized loans; consumer loans (including installment loans, such as point-of-sale loans, and credit card loans); small business loans (including installment, lines of credit and credit cards); residential mortgages; transaction banking; deposit-taking; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; and agency lending. 
 GS Co. is our principal U.S. broker-dealer and is registered as a broker-dealer, a securities-based swap dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, have adopted rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS Co. 
 Our principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include: Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI); Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE); and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC).

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, as well as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). GSBE s London branch is regulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain activities primarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market making in debt and equity securities and derivatives, investment, asset and wealth management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial advisory services. GSBE is also a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. As a foreign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB s Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting and market making in equity securities based on GSBE s and/or GS Bank USA s capital. 
 GSPIC is an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) and the French Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC s activities include certain activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. GSPIC's application to ACPR in October 2021 to become a credit institution remains pending. 
 GSI is a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB is a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a securities-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities and is a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIB maintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located. 
 Our principal subsidiary operating in Asia is Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSJCL is our regulated Japanese broker-dealer subsidiary and is regulated by Japan s Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others. 
 Banking Supervision and Regulation 
 The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation. However, the Basel Committee s standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of Basel Committee standards and related regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop. 

Capital and Liquidity Requirements. We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies tailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Category I standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are Advanced approach banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. 
 GSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on Basel III. The most recent amendments to the CRR and CRD (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include changes to the liquidity, market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have been applicable in the E.U. since June 2021. From June 2022, the CRR requires large institutions with securities traded on a regulated market of a member state to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to environmental, social and governance risks on an annual basis. Under an E.U. proposal, these requirements would apply to our E.U.-regulated entities beginning in January 2025. 
 GSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity frameworks, which are also largely based on Basel III and are predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks. The most recent amendments to the U.K. frameworks include changes to the liquidity, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. The changes have been applicable in the U.K. since January 2022.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Risk-Based Capital Ratios. As Advanced approach banking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate risk-based capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced Capital Rules and the Standardized Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization s eligible retained income, defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5 buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and both a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5 buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer. 
 The SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve s supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. See Stress Tests and Capital Planning below. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank USA. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future, including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time. 
 The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have a rule that implements the Basel Committee s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the rule, Advanced approach banking organizations are required to use SA-CCR for calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below. 

The capital requirements applicable to GSBE, GSI and GSIB include both minimum requirements and buffers. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K for information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB. 
 The Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). Depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not designated any D-SIBs. The CRD and CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). BaFin has identified GSBE as an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer. 
 In the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer. 
 The Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal model-based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented the revised framework by January 1, 2023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE, commenced reporting their market risk calculations under the revised framework in the third quarter of 2021. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation paper to implement this framework.

The Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel III Revisions). These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee s standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented these standards and that the new floor will be phased in through January 1, 2028. The U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the Basel III Revisions for purposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The European Commission proposed rules to implement the Basel III Revisions in October 2021 and in November 2022, the Council of the E.U. adopted its general approach on implementing the Basel III revisions. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, generally taking effect in January 2025. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation on the implementation of the Basel III Revisions, with a proposed January 2025 effective date. Under the PRA consultation, our U.K. subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on internally modeled capital requirements. 
 The Basel Committee has published an updated securitization framework and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing them. The updated securitization framework has been implemented in the E.U. and U.K. 
 In December 2022, the Basel Committee published a final standard on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures. The Basel Committee contemplates that national regulators will have incorporated the standard into local capital requirements by January 1, 2025. U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and E.U. and U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the standards. 
 Leverage Ratios. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. As a G-SIB, the SLR requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, which operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer requirements described above. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i) replace the current 2 SLR buffer for G-SIBs, including us, with a buffer equal to 50 of their G-SIB surcharge and (ii) revise the 6 SLR requirement for Category I banks, such as GS Bank USA, to be well capitalized with a requirement equal to 3 plus 50 of their parent s G-SIB surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017. 

GSBE and certain of our U.K. entities are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally based on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards. 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USA s Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI s leverage ratio. 
 Liquidity Ratios. The Basel Committee s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). 
 The LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 . See Available Information below and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity Regulatory Framework in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our average daily LCR. 
 GSBE is subject to the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the rules approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities' LCR rules. These rules are generally consistent with the Basel Committee s framework. 
 The NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee s NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100 . 
 We are subject to the U.S. NSFR rule and we will be required to publicly disclose our quarterly average daily NSFR semi-annually. We will begin doing so in August 2023. The CRR implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. The NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K. is applicable to both GSI and GSIB.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The FRB s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA s ILAAP. 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Overview and Structure of Risk Management and Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity Regulatory Framework in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity. 
 Stress Tests and Capital Planning. The FRB s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the FRB for review. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital plan. As described in Available Information below, summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website. 
 As part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB s own stress tests. 

The FRB s rule applicable to BHCs with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, replaced the static 2.5 component of the capital conservation buffer required under the Standardized Capital Rules with the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject to a 2.5 floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan. See Available Information below and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Management and Regulatory Capital in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 K for information about our SCB requirement. 
 The SCB rule requires a BHC to receive the FRB s approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan, which may occur if the BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since the plan was last submitted, or if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan. 
 U.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, such as GS Bank USA, are required to submit annual company-run stress test results to the FRB. GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the PRA s ICAAP guidelines. 
 Limitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity s undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval. As a result of dividend payments from GS Bank USA to Group Inc. in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any dividends without regulatory approval.

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 
 Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB s invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC. 
 Transactions Between Affiliates. Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. PRA rules provide similar requirements for transactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective affiliates. 

Resolution and Recovery Plans. We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB and FDIC require U.S. G-SIBs to submit resolution plans every two years (alternating between submissions of full plans and targeted plans that include only select information). We submitted our 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted submission, in June 2021, and the FRB and FDIC did not identify any deficiencies or shortcomings. Our next required submission is a full submission by July 1, 2023. See Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory The application of Group Inc. s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc. s security holders in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about our resolution plan. 
 We are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements. 
 GS Bank USA is required to provide a resolution plan to the FDIC that must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA s most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In June 2021, the FDIC provided guidance on insured depository institution (IDI) resolution plans and divided IDIs with 100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA, into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions. GS Bank USA is in the second group with a later submission date. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 15 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below. 
 Certain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol, was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies. 
 The E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U. law recognize those temporary stay and bail-in powers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of non-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE s primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank. 

The U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank of England s expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity and funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to the PRA. 
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The FRB's rule addresses U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board s (FSB s) TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. The rule, among other things, establishes minimum TLAC requirements, establishes minimum requirements for eligible long-term debt (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) and caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. 
 The rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties. 
 Additionally, the rule caps, at 5 of the value of the parent company s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. 
 The CRR, the BRRD and U.K. financial services regime are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB s minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs. For example, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that exceed the threshold of 5 of the G-SIB s RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSBE, to meet internal TLAC requirements. Under the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to internal TLAC requirements.

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The CRD requires a non-E.U. group with more than 40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. GSBE and GSPIC will be subject to the single E.U. IHC requirement unless an exemption is granted. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented a similar requirement to establish an IHC; however, the PRA has introduced a requirement that certain U.K. financial holding companies or a designated U.K. group entity be responsible for the U.K. group s regulatory compliance. We have designated GSI for that responsibility. 
 The BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to an MREL, which is generally consistent with the FSB s TLAC standard. GSI is required to maintain a minimum level of internal MREL and provide the Bank of England the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. The Single Resolution Board s internal MREL requirements applicable to GSBE are required to be phased in through January 2024. 
 Insolvency of a BHC or IDI. The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects. 
 If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA, described below. 

Substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a bridge holding company under its single point of entry or SPOE strategy pursuant to OLA. 
 Under the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power: 
 To transfer any of the IDI s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed bridge bank, without the approval of the depository institution s creditors; 
 To enforce the IDI s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or 
 To repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI. 
 In addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA .

Deposit Insurance. Deposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. Eligible deposits at GSIB and the London branch of GS Bank USA are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits. 
 In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a rule applicable to all FDIC-insured banks that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC above. 

The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC s general unsecured creditors, as described in Source of Strength above. 
 Volcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. As a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage. 
 Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule prohibits proprietary trading, but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. 
 In addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3 or less of the fund s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3 or less of our Tier 1 capital. 
 The FRB has granted our request for additional time until July 2023 to conform our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy illiquid funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our investments in such funds.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Other Restrictions. FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5 or more of their consolidated assets. 
 The FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. 
 If any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. 
 In addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S. 
 U.S. G-SIBs, like us, are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. 
 The New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA s activities. 
 The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions. 

As a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions under German banking law and regulations on December 31, 2023 because its financial assets exceeded certain thresholds. Prohibited activities include (i) proprietary trading, (ii) high-frequency trading at a German trading venue, and (iii) lending and guarantee businesses with German hedge funds, German funds of hedge funds or any non-German substantially leveraged alternative investment funds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies. See Volcker Rule above for further information. 
 U.K. banks that have over 25 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as ring-fencing. GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement. 
 Broker-Dealer and Securities Regulation 
 Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, including GS Co., are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, the use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. 
 U.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS Co. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS Co., see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Capital Management and Regulatory Capital U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 The SEC issued a proposed rule in November 2021 which, if adopted, would require lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to a registered national securities association, such as FINRA. 
 The SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers. SEC rules require broker-dealers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. In addition, several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers.

In December 2022, the SEC issued four proposals to reform the U.S. equity market structure. The SEC proposed establishing a broker-dealer best execution standard, which would require broker-dealers to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for a customer order so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. The best execution standard applies to all securities and supplements, but does not replace, the existing FINRA and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) best execution rules. The SEC also proposed, among other things, to require that individual investor orders routed through broker-dealers be exposed to order-by-order competition in qualified auctions; to update the minimum pricing increments, with variable price increments based on the trading characteristics of stocks; and to revise and expand reporting and disclosure requirements relating to execution quality. 
 In January 2023, the SEC proposed a rule that would prohibit participants involved in the creation of asset-backed securities, including any underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser or sponsor of an asset-backed security (or any affiliate or subsidiary), from engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the securitization participant and an investor in an asset-backed security, including reducing its exposure to the asset-backed securities, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations. 
 GS Co. and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. 
 In Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSBE, GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight by European and national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and other national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. 

In the E.U. and the U.K., the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) established trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform, enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wide range of financial instruments, placed volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for equities trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer equities crossing networks and created a regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client equity transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements apply to algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. MiFID II also requires enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, restrictions on the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including GSBE and GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities. 
 GSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others. 
 The Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Securities Exchange, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service and the Central Bank of Brazil, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the U.S. regulators. 
 Our exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.

Swaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation 
 The commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities. 
 The terms swaps and security-based swaps include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations. 
 CFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer. GS Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. The CFTC has rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also has financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants that provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC s capital requirements. 
 Our affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements. 

SEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) record-keeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; (iii) business conduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. Certain of our subsidiaries, including GS Co., GS Bank USA and GSBE, are registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and subject to the SEC s regulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has proposed additional regulations regarding security-based swaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large positions in security-based swaps. 
 GS Bank USA is also subject to the FRB s swaps margin rules. These rules require the exchange of initial and variation margin in connection with transactions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared through a registered or exempt clearinghouse. GS Bank USA is required to post and collect margin in connection with transactions with swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants, or financial end users. 
 The CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps and securities-based swaps, and business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain non-U.S. regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearinghouses, and have approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. margin rules. 
 Similar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of derivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges.

The CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common ownership or control. The CFTC position limits apply to futures on physical commodities and options on such futures, apply to both physically and cash settled positions and to swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options. The position limit rules initially impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days). CFTC spot and non-spot month limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities, and it is possible that non-spot month limits will at some point be adopted for futures, options on futures and swaps on other categories of physical commodities. 
 J. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an exempt holding company under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules. 
 In addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described in Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 GS Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer. 
 Asset Management and Wealth Management Regulation 
 Our asset management and wealth management businesses are subject to extensive oversight by regulators around the world relating to, among other things, the fair treatment of clients, safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds. 

The federal securities laws impose fiduciary duties on investment advisers, including GS Co., Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and our other U.S. registered investment adviser subsidiaries. Additionally, SEC rules require investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to advisers. 
 Certain of our European subsidiaries, including GSBE in the E.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to MiFID II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of E.U. or U.K.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. NNIP B.V. is subject to similar requirements as a management company licensed under the E.U. Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and the E.U. Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive with additional authorizations for certain activities regulated under MiFID II. Our asset management business in the E.U. and the U.K. significantly depends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to other affiliates. 
 GSAMI is also subject to the prudential regime for U.K. investment firms, the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR), which governs the prudential requirements for U.K. investment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA. 
 Consumer Regulation 
 Our U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Our consumer-oriented activities are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, which, among other things, impose obligations relating to marketing, origination, servicing and collections activities in our consumer businesses. Many of these laws, rules and regulations also apply to our small business lending activities, which are also subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. In addition, our U.K. consumer deposit-taking activities are subject to U.K. consumer protection laws and regulations. 
 Compensation Practices 
 Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide.

The FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring securities exchanges to adopt rules mandating, in the case of a restatement, the recovery or clawback of excess incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by a restatement. 
 The NYDFS guidance emphasizes that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control. 
 In the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are designed to meet the FSB s compensation standards. These provisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended certain aspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB. 
 The E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment firm regimes, including rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations 
 The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable to financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. 
 The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. 
 We are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide relating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, including the E.U. Anti-Money Laundering Directives. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.

Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation 
 Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the privacy of information regarding clients, employees and others. These include, but are not limited to, the GLB Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA), the E.U. s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People s Republic of China (PIPL), and the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. Among other things, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In addition, several other states and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. Furthermore, the GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. The PIPL limits the legal bases for processing personal information, contains heightened notice and consent requirements for the handling of certain types of personal information and imposes special cross-border data transfer rules under certain circumstances. 
 Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and related risks, and which require regulatory disclosures of certain security incidents. The NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cybersecurity policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer. 
 In January 2023, the E.U. Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) became effective, and will apply from January 2025. DORA requires E.U. financial entities, such as GSBE, to have a comprehensive governance and control framework for the management of information and communications technology (ICT) risk. 
 In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that would require disclosures about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and updated disclosures about previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.

Statements about our target return on average common shareholders equity (ROE), return on average tangible common shareholders equity (ROTE), efficiency ratio and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding our business prospects and are subject to the risk that we may be unable to achieve our targets due to, among other things, changes in our business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. 
 Statements about our target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to us and are subject to the risk that our actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of our activities.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses. 
 The following is a summary of some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses: 
 Market 
 Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions. 
 Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net long positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral. 
 Our market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility. 
 Our investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions. 
 Our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees. 
 Inflation has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets. 
 Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. 
 Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding. 
 Group Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc. 

Credit 
 Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties. 
 Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. 
 Derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks and potential losses. 
 Operational 
 A failure in our operational systems or human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 A failure or disruption in our infrastructure, or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 A failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies. 
 Legal and Regulatory 
 Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world. 
 A failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses. 
 We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity. 
 Substantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. 
 In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries. 
 The application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc. s security holders. 
 The application of Group Inc. s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc. s security holders.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs. 
 Competition 
 Our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base. 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. 
 The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, including cryptocurrencies, has increased competition. 
 Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees. 
 Market Developments and General Business Environment 
 Our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters. 
 Climate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation. 
 Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by Russia s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and other developments. 
 Certain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular USD LIBOR. 
 Certain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked. 
 Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. 
 We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and markets. 
 We may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect, or at all. 

The following are detailed descriptions of our Risk Factors summarized above: 
 Market 
 Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions. 
 Many of our businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally, both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively. 
 Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings. 
 Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; concerns over a potential recession; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; high levels of inflation or stagflation; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. 
 The financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates, inflation and other borrowing costs, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, and limitations on international trade, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 29 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

General uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses. 
 Changes, or proposed changes, to U.S. international trade and investment policies, particularly with important trading partners, have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets. Continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the U.S. or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets. Those actions could include, among others, the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or other restrictions on cross-border trade, investment, or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients businesses. 
 Financial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks. 
 In January 2023, the outstanding debt of the U.S. reached its statutory limit and the U.S. Treasury Department commenced taking extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. could default on its obligations, including Treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets. A default by the U.S. could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity, heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions, margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties, an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasuries, downgrades in the U.S. credit rating, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the U.S. or other economies. Even if the U.S. does not default, continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, which could adversely affect market conditions, lead to margin disputes, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants, including us. A downgrade of the federal government s credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and lending, and other financings typically collateralized by U.S. Treasury or agency obligations. Further, the fair value, liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by, or other obligations of, agencies of the U.S. government or related to the U.S. government or its agencies, as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected. 

Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net long positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral. 
 Many of our businesses have net long positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are marked-to-market on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures to those declines. 
 In certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. We may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function, including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital. 
 In our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity. 
 We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

We post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a margin call in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties. 
 In addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner, including in violation of law, or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business. 
 Our market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility. 
 Certain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or may cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances, we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements. 

Our investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions. 
 Our investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers domestic markets, that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices, have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses. Furthermore, changes, or proposed changes, to international trade and investment policies of the U.S. and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues. 
 In certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both. 
 Market uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees. 
 Poor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected. 
 Inflation has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Inflationary pressures have affected economies, financial markets and market participants worldwide. Inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses, and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and CEO confidence. Central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates, which, in turn, have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets, in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations, and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments. Higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits. If inflationary pressures persist, our expenses may increase further; we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target; activity levels for certain of our businesses, in particular debt underwriting and mortgages, may remain at low levels or decline further; our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income, reducing our net interest income and net interest margin; certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns; AUS could decline, reducing management and other fees; economies worldwide could experience recessions; and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment. 

Liquidity 
 Our liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets. 
 Liquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk. 
 We employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions. 
 Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example, in 2021, an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity. 
 Numerous regulations have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions, including us. These regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress.

Our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. 
 Widening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making. 
 Our clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses. 
 Our credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses. 

Reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding. 
 Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. 
 As of December 2022, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of 343 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and 1.12 billion in the event of a two-notch downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management Credit Ratings in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.

Group Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc. 
 Group Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. 
 In addition, our broker-dealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB s source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc. s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. 
 There has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to ring fence or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to bail-in powers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis. 

Furthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations. 
 The requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments. 
 See Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about regulatory restrictions.

Credit 
 Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties. 
 We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. 
 We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. 
 A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity. 
 As part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. 

Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. 
 Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities. Disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for loans we originate. These disruptions may make it difficult for us to sell or value such assets, which may result in losses for us from time to time. 
 Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties.

Derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks and potential losses. 
 We are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us. 
 Derivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be netted against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized. 
 As a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB s and FDIC s rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts. 
 Derivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights. 
 In addition, as new complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms. 

Operational 
 A failure in our operational systems or human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. 
 Many rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As reporting requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging. 
 As our client base, including through our consumer businesses, and our geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased, as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. These risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumer-oriented activities. Allegations or publicity, whether or not accurate, that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.

Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. 
 The use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third-party service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-from-home arrangements. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may occur in the future. The use of personal devices by our employees or by our vendors for work-related activities also presents risks related to potential violations of record retention and other requirements. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients access to our platforms. There have been a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks. 

Notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in the past resulted and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us. 
 The majority of the employees in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area, London, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Salt Lake City and Dallas, work in close proximity to one another. Our headquarters is located in the New York metropolitan area, and we have our largest employee concentration occupying two principal office buildings near the Hudson River waterfront. They are subject to potential catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, extreme weather, or other hostile events that could negatively affect our business. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employees inability to occupy the offices, communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely. As a result, our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted, due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans.

A failure or disruption in our infrastructure, or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 We face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients systems. 
 There has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. 
 The interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through, among other things, application programming interfaces or APIs presents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. 
 Despite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events. 

In addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, we are exposed to risks if our vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors use of common service providers. 
 Additionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may become exposed to additional risks, related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies or other digital assets, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries, and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral. The market volatility that financial products using distributed ledger technology have recently experienced may increase these risks. 
 A failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. 
 Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers, governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.

We are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements . In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation. 
 Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent. 
 Although we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems. 

If one or more of these types of events occur, it potentially could jeopardize our, our clients , our counterparties or third parties' confidential and other information processed, stored in, or transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or third parties, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated, and, following detection or escalation, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. Moreover, potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been resolved or fully investigated. 
 We have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. 
 Our clients confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can work-from-home arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.

We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. 
 We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies. 
 We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. 
 The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. 

In addition, the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective, either because of poor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs. 
 To the extent that we have positions through our market-making or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities, including private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments. 
 Prudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities. 
 As we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit and investment products to consumers, we are presented with different risks and must expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us.

Legal and Regulatory 
 Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world. 
 As a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, fined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability. 
 In addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities, day-to-day compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability. 
 Our revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions. The laws and regulations that apply to our businesses are often complex and, in many cases, we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws and regulations to our business activities. Changes in interpretations, whether in response to regulatory guidance, industry conventions, our own reassessments or otherwise, could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, such as capital or liquidity requirements. 

If there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (whether based on size, method of funding, activities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on stock transfers, share repurchases and other financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure or where these services are provided. 
 These developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements, including reducing dividends or share repurchases, liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our profitability. Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including the credit and operational risk capital standards published in December 2017 and the market risk capital standard published in January 2019. 
 As described in Business Regulation Banking Supervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a G SIB, we are subject to the G SIB surcharge. Our G SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our G SIB surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements. 

We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. 
 Further, the CRD requires certain non-E.U. groups with more than 40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. IHC by December 30, 2023. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. If we are unable to obtain approval to have two E.U. IHCs, we would be required to limit our European subsidiary activities to those that are permissible for GSBE. 
 In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology. 
 We have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we may expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.

Our expansion into consumer-oriented activities will result in a change to GS Bank USA's CRA requirements later in 2023, such that GS Bank USA will no longer be assessed as a wholesale bank for CRA compliance purposes and, instead, will be assessed pursuant to the framework applicable to large commercial banks or pursuant to an approved strategic plan. Any failure to comply with different or expanded CRA requirements as a result of this change in assessment methods could negatively impact GS Bank USA's CRA ratings, cause reputational harm and result in limits on our ability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new activities. 
 Increasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a control person for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish fiduciary obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences. 
 For information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 

A failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses. 
 Due to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. 
 In addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds. 
 We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs initiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. The realignment of our businesses, reflected in our new segments beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, presents similar risks.

We may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity. 
 Governmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters remains at high levels. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past resulted and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits. 
 Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other misconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Further, we are subject to regulatory settlements, orders and feedback that require significant remediation activities, which require us to commit significant resources, including hiring, as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of new controls, policies and procedures. 
 The financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity. 

Substantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. 
 We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as follow-on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements. 
 Significant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties. 
 Claims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Financial institutions (including us) have been subject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to alleged bid-rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements and fines in the past and may do so in the future. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.

Certain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees. See for example, 1MDB-Related Matters in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of this type of settlement, we are no longer a well-known seasoned issuer, which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities. 
 In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries. 
 In conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, communications and other content restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases. 

While business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, 1MDB-Related Matters in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 In addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB.

The application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc. s security holders. 
 As described in Business Regulation Banking Supervision and Regulation Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC, if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc. s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders. 
 The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the top-tier BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc. s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries. 
 Assuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. or other available resources to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc. s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc. s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc. s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group Inc. s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc. s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc. s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc. s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims. 

OLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including senior creditors. 
 In addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc. s assets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claims exchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible. 
 In addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such bail-in powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such bail-in powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is bailed in, Group Inc. s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and non-U.S. authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.

The application of Group Inc. s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc. s security holders. 
 In our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc. s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc. s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses. 
 To facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds. 
 We also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc. s and Funding IHC s obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc. s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented. 

If Group Inc. s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc. s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc. s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc. s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc. s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc. s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc. s major subsidiaries. 
 If Group Inc. s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc. s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc. s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk. 
 As a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. 
 Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs. 
 As part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices. 
 We make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production, storage and transportation of numerous commodities, including many of the commodities referenced above. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 47 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

These activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental, antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments. 
 There may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities and investments. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses. 
 Commodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our control, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses. 
 The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm. 
 We may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy in response to climate change. 

Competition 
 Our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base. 
 Our client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility. 
 Correspondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution. 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. 
 The financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. As we have expanded into new business areas and new geographic regions, we have faced competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand our businesses.

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Governments and regulators have adopted regulations, imposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or non-U.S. competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively. 
 Pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook. 
 The financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions, and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities, they may not be effective. Allegations of such activities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements, and potentially significant penalties, including treble damages. 
 The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, including cryptocurrencies, has increased competition. 
 Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. 

We have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades. 
 In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies, including distributed ledgers, such as digital assets and blockchain, have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services, and we expect to continue to make such investments, which could be material. The adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such as those based on distributed ledgers, that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services. Regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating, or even able to develop or integrate, new products and technologies, such as those built on distributed ledgers, into our existing products and services, adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us. 
 Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees. 
 Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year-end discretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 49 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region. 
 Laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees income or the amount or composition of compensation, or that require us to disclose our or our competitors compensation practices, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions. 
 As described further in Business Regulation Compensation Practices in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations have shaped our compensation practices, which has, in some cases, adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations, and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects. 
 Our operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate. 

Market Developments and General Business Environment 
 Our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters. 
 The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, solar events or other natural disasters, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These events could have such effects through economic or financial market disruptions or challenging economic or market conditions more generally, the deterioration of our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties, changes in consumer sentiment and consumer borrowing, spending and savings patterns, liquidity stress, or operational difficulties (such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that impair our ability to manage our businesses. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on, among other things, future developments, including any resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 Climate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation. 
 Climate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy.

 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

We are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy, laws and regulations, or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our or our clients involvement in, or decision not to participate in, certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or otherwise inappropriate, our business, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer. 
 New regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of government officials, regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products. Federal and state, and non-U.S. banking regulators and supervisory authorities, shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change, both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment and advisory activities. The FRB has announced that we are among the six U.S. financial institutions participating in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise in 2023, and we also are subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties, and we expect that climate change-related risks will increase over time. 

Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by Russia s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and other developments. 
 The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively affected the global economy. Governments around the world have responded to Russia s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors, including price caps on Russian oil, and parties in Russia. Compliance with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has increased our costs and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. Russia has responded with its own restrictions against investors and countries outside Russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at non-Russia owned businesses. Businesses in the U.S. and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other hostilities could result in, among other things, further increased risk of cyber attacks, an increased frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. 
 The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, and the consequences for our business could be significant. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk Management Selected Exposures Country Exposures for further information about our credit exposure to Russia and Ukraine.

Certain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular USD LIBOR. 
 On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA proposed that certain of those USD LIBOR settings continue to be published on a synthetic basis through September 2024. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024. 
 The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA s formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act), that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs. 

The language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. Although the LIBOR Act includes safe harbors if the FRB-identified SOFR-based replacement rate is selected, these safe harbors are untested. As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, the selection of a successor rate could result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. Discretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback provisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly for derivatives and other synthetic instruments. 
 Changes in, the discontinuation of, or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR, particularly USD LIBOR, as a reference rate may adversely affect certain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products. 
 Certain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked. 
 Many of the products that we own or that we offer, such as structured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (the underlier). In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may experience adverse effects.

Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. 
 Continued or escalating tensions between the U.S. and China have resulted in and may result in additional changes to U.S. international trade and investment policies, which could disrupt international trade and investment, adversely affect financial markets, including market activity levels, and adversely impact our revenues. Continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the U.S., China or other countries taking other actions, which could include the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or restrictions on cross-border trade, investment or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients businesses, as well as our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially. 
 A conflict, or concerns about a potential conflict, involving China and Taiwan, the U.S. or other countries could negatively impact financial markets and our or our clients businesses. Trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries in response to a conflict or potential conflict involving China, including financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain organizations or individuals, or actions taken by China in response to trade restrictions, could negatively impact our or our clients ability to conduct business in certain countries or with certain counterparties and could negatively impact regional and global financial markets and economic conditions. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially. 

We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets. 
 A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, could continue to bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally. 
 Furthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S. 
 We have increased our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, we now issue credit cards to consumers and through our acquisition of GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), we expanded our offering of point-of-sale financing. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. Acquisitions and new products can also expose us to new or different types of risks. For example, providing point-of-sale financing through GreenSky also subjects us to risks relating to retaining and attracting merchants and servicing loans for other banks, as well as potential liability for remediation costs if merchants fail to fulfill their obligations to consumers. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 53 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

We have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities. As a result, we expect to face additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect to know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities. 
 New business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational concerns arising from dealing with different types of clients, business partners, counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients, business partners, counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions. 
 We have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, and expect to continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as generating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending, our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business. 

In recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues. In order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively, we have made and may continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumer-oriented activities. Such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses. 
 We may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect, or at all. 
 We have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. Any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. We may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection with acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is time-consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial, management and other resources. It is also possible that an acquisition, once announced, may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals. 
 There is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect, or at all. If we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 There is no assurance that the reorganization of our business segments will yield all of the expected benefits in the time frames that we expect, or at all.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 In the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas, we have offices consisting of approximately 6.7 million square feet of leased and owned space. Our principal executive offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, New York and consist of approximately 2.1 million square feet. The building is located on a parcel leased from Battery Park City Authority pursuant to a ground lease. Under the lease, Battery Park City Authority holds title to all improvements, including the office building, subject to our right of exclusive possession and use until June 2069, the expiration date of the lease. Under the terms of the ground lease, we made a lump sum ground rent payment in June 2007 of 161 million for rent through the term of the lease. 
 In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we have offices consisting of approximately 1.8 million square feet of leased and owned space. Our European headquarters is located in London at Plumtree Court, consisting of approximately 826,000 square feet under a lease which can be terminated in 2039. 
 In Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we have offices consisting of approximately 2.8 million square feet, including our offices in India, and regional headquarters in Tokyo and Hong Kong. In India, we have offices with approximately 1.7 million square feet, the majority of which have leases that will expire in 2028. 
 In the preceding paragraphs, square footage figures are provided only for properties that are used in the operation of our businesses. We regularly evaluate our space capacity in relation to current and projected headcount. We may incur exit costs in the future if we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in locations in which we operate and dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. These costs may be material to our operating results in a given period. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses may remain high.

Executive Overview 
 We generated net earnings of 11.26 billion for 2022, compared with 21.64 billion for 2021. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was 30.06 for 2022, compared with 59.45 for 2021. Return on average common shareholders equity (ROE) was 10.2 for 2022, compared with 23.0 for 2021. Book value per common share was 303.55 as of December 2022, 6.7 higher compared with December 2021. 
 Net revenues were 47.37 billion for 2022, 20 lower than a strong 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Asset Wealth Management and lower net revenues in Global Banking Markets, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Platform Solutions. Net revenues in Asset Wealth Management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments. Net revenues in Global Banking Markets primarily reflected significantly lower Investment banking fees compared with a strong prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC). Net revenues in Platform Solutions were significantly higher, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms. 
 Provision for credit losses was 2.72 billion for 2022, compared with 357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Operating expenses were 31.16 billion for 2022, 2 lower than 2021, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NN Investment Partners (NNIP) and GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky) and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 65.8 for 2022, compared with 53.8 for 2021. 
 During 2022, we returned a total of 6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of 3.50 billion and common stock dividends of 3.20 billion. As of December 2022, our CET1 capital ratio was 15.1 under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.4 under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Business Environment 
 In 2022, the global economy was impacted by persistent broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war, and inflationary and labor market pressures. Governments around the world responded to Russia s invasion of Ukraine by imposing economic sanctions, and global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. These factors contributed to increased market volatility during the year, as well as a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. 
 The economic outlook remains uncertain, reflecting concerns about the continuation or escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical risks, inflation, and supply chain complications. See Results of Operations Segment Assets and Operating Results Segment Operating Results for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Fair Value 
 Fair Value Hierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. 

The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. 
 Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.8 as of December 2022 and 1.6 as of December 2021 of our total assets. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include: 
 Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; 
 Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and 
 Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. 
 Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence. 
 Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.

 Price Verification. All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include: 
 Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. 
 External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, S P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE Data Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. 
 Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. 
 Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. 
 Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations. 
 Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels. 
 Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. 
 See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. 
 Review of Net Revenues. Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. 

Review of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See Risk Management Model Risk Management for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. 
 The allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. 
 Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. 
 We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. 
 To estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December 2022 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100 weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100 weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate 1.0 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of December 2022. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses. 

Use of Estimates 
 U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. 
 Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. The estimated fair value of our Consumer platforms reporting unit, which represents approximately 7.5 of our goodwill, was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. This reporting unit has been adversely impacted by the recent operating environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. We will continue to closely monitor it to determine whether an impairment is required in the future. As of December 2022, the goodwill related to the Consumer platforms reporting unit was 482 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our reporting units or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. 
 Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.

 We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. 
 In accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 2022, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 1.22 billion. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of December 2022, we had 8.93 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of 1.57 billion. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.

Results of Operations 
 The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

 In the table above: 
 Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends. 
 ROE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders equity. Tangible common shareholders equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. 
 Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders equity and ROTE are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

 In the table above: 
 Investment banking consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from financial advisory and underwriting assignments. These activities are included in Global Banking Markets. 
 Investment management consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from providing asset management and wealth advisory services across all major asset classes to a diverse set of clients. These activities are included in Asset Wealth Management. 
 Commissions and fees consists of revenues from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Substantially all of these activities are included in Global Banking Markets. 
 Market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in Global Banking Markets. 

Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from our equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in Asset Wealth Management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments). 
 Operating Environment. During 2022, the operating environment was characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. These factors contributed to solid market-making activity levels and a decline in industry-wide investment banking activity, particularly for underwriting. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. 
 If concerns about the economic outlook grow, including those about the continuation or escalation of geopolitical concerns, inflation and supply chain complications, and the persistence of COVID-19-related effects, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or a decline in market-making activity levels, or a continued decline in investment banking activity levels, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See Segment Assets and Operating Results Segment Operating Results for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. 
 2022 versus 2021 
 Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 47.37 billion for 2022, 20 lower than a strong 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and investment banking revenues, partially offset by significantly higher market making revenues. 
 Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 7.36 billion for 2022, 48 lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower revenues in advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 9.01 billion for 2022, 10 higher than 2021, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. 
 Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were 4.03 billion for 2022, 12 higher than 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher volumes. 
 Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 18.63 billion for 2022, 21 higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by lower revenues in equity products. 
 Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 654 million for 2022, compared with 11.62 billion for 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities and net mark-downs in debt investments compared with net mark-ups in 2021. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was 7.68 billion for 2022, 19 higher than 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average balances and higher average interest rates. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and deposits, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. See Statistical Disclosures Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity for further information about our sources of net interest income. 
 2021 versus 2020 
 Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 59.34 billion for 2021, 33 higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues. 
 Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 14.14 billion for 2021, 55 higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. 

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 8.17 billion for 2021, 17 higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. 
 Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were 3.59 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020. 
 Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 15.36 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages. 
 Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were 11.62 billion for 2021, compared with 4.76 billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was 6.47 billion for 2021, 36 higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans. See Supplemental Financial Information Statistical Disclosures Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity for further information about our sources of net interest income. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Provision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 2022 versus 2021. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was 2.72 billion for 2022, compared with 357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 2021 versus 2020. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was 357 million for 2021, compared with 3.10 billion for 2020. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including approximately 185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. 
 The table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount. 
 Year Ended December in millions 2022 2021 2020 Compensation and benefits 15,148 17,719 13,309 Transaction based 5,312 4,710 4,141 Market development 812 553 401 Communications and technology 1,808 1,573 1,347 Depreciation and amortization 2,455 2,015 1,902 Occupancy 1,026 981 960 Professional fees 1,887 1,648 1,306 Other expenses 2,716 2,739 5,617 Total operating expenses 31,164 31,938 28,983 Headcount at period-end 48,500 43,900 40,500 

2022 versus 2021. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were 31.16 billion for 2022, 2 lower than 2021. Our efficiency ratio was 65.8 for 2022, compared with our medium-term target efficiency ratio of approximately 60 . Our efficiency ratio was 53.8 for 2021. 
 The decrease in operating expenses compared with 2021 was primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. While certain expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, occupancy and market development) were impacted by inflationary pressures, the overall impact of higher inflation was not material to our operating expenses for 2022. 
 Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were 576 million for 2022 compared with 534 million for 2021. 
 Headcount increased 10 during 2022, primarily reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions of NNIP and GreenSky. 
 2021 versus 2020. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were 31.94 billion for 2021, 10 higher than 2020. Our efficiency ratio was 53.8 for 2021, compared with 65.0 for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points. 
 The increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). 
 Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were 534 million for 2021 compared with 3.42 billion for 2020. 
 Charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives were approximately 250 million for 2021. 
 Headcount increased 8 during 2021, reflecting investments in growth initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.

 Provision for Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for 2022 was 16.5 , down from the full year income tax rate of 20.0 for 2021, primarily due to an increase in the impact of permanent tax benefits, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of earnings in 2022 compared with 2021. 
 The U.K. Finance Act 2021 increased the corporate income tax rate by six percent and the Finance Act 2022 decreased the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate by five percent effective from April 1, 2023. As a result, beginning April 1, 2023, the U.K. tax rate for our U.K. regulated broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), will increase by one percent and the U.K. tax rate for all other U.K. subsidiaries and branches will increase by six percent. During 2022, following Royal Assent of Finance Act 2022, certain U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a net reduction in deferred tax assets of approximately 50 million was recognized. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes income tax incentives to encourage investments in clean energy and a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). The CAMT applies to corporations with average annual profits over 1 billion and is calculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The legislation had no impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate and based on our current understanding of the CAMT, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2023 annual effective tax rate.

 Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments. 
 The allocation of common shareholders equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment s pre-tax earnings. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.

 Market-Making Activities 
 As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. 
 The amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. 
 In general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions. 
 Other. We lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are also reported as part of Other. Other also includes equity and debt investing activities related to our Global Banking Markets activities.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 In the table above: 
 Volumes are per Dealogic. 
 Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction. 
 Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings. 
 Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. It also includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans. 
 Operating Environment. During 2022, Global Banking Markets operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which negatively affected industry-wide investment banking activity levels, particularly for underwriting, but contributed to solid market-making activity levels. 
 In investment banking, compared with 2021, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes were low amid volatile equity markets and a decline in prices, and industry-wide debt underwriting volumes declined across leveraged finance and investment grade issuances amid rising interest rates. Additionally, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions declined from elevated levels in the prior year. 
 For volatility, the average daily VIX was 30 higher compared with 2021. In equities, the S P 500 Index decreased by 19 and the MSCI World Index decreased by 20 , compared with the end of 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. 
 In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, and activity levels or volatility decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in Global Banking Markets would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate further or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. 

2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Global Banking Markets were 32.49 billion for 2022, 12 lower than a strong 2021. 
 Investment banking fees were 7.36 billion, 48 lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year. 
 As of December 2022, our Investment banking fees backlog decreased significantly compared with the end of 2021, primarily due to significantly lower estimated net revenues from both potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (primarily from leveraged finance transactions). 
 Our backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. 
 Net revenues in FICC were 14.68 billion, 38 higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and lower net revenues in credit products. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, primarily driven by secured lending. 
 The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2021 results: 
 Net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. 
 Net revenues in mortgages and credit products primarily reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Net revenues in Equities were 10.99 billion, 6 lower than 2021, due to lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. Net revenues in Equities financing were higher, primarily reflecting increased client activity. 
 Net revenues in Other were (537) million for 2022, compared with 265 million for 2021, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in equities and net mark-downs on acquisition financing activities. 
 Provision for credit losses was 468 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of 171 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by growth in the portfolio. 
 Operating expenses were 17.85 billion for 2022, 9 lower than 2021, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). Pre-tax earnings were 14.17 billion for 2022, 18 lower than 2021. 
 2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Global Banking Markets were 36.73 billion for 2021, 21 higher than 2020. 
 Investment banking fees were 14.14 billion, 55 higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in Equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in Debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. 
 As of December 2021, our Investment banking fees backlog increased significantly compared with December 2020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions. 
 Net revenues in FICC were 10.61 billion, 7 lower than 2020, due to lower net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. Net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from secured lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements. 

The decrease in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2020 results: 
 Net revenues in interest rate products primarily reflected lower client activity. 
 Net revenues in credit products and currencies reflected lower client activity, partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory. 
 Net revenues in mortgages reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory. 
 Net revenues in commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. 
 Net revenues in Equities were 11.72 billion, 19 higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting increased activity (including higher average client balances), and higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in derivatives. 
 Net revenues in Other were 265 million for 2021, compared with 32 million for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in equities. 
 Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of 171 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of 1.22 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by portfolio growth. 
 Operating expenses were 19.54 billion for 2021, 3 higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance) and higher transaction based expenses, largely offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax earnings were 17.36 billion, 67 higher than 2020. ROE was 22.5 for 2021, compared with 13.6 for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 5.4 percentage points).

 Operating Environment. During 2022, Asset Wealth Management operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in asset prices compared to the end of 2021, negatively affecting assets under supervision and investments. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. 
 In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets or deposits, and net revenues in Asset Wealth Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 
 2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Asset Wealth Management were 13.38 billion for 2022, 39 lower than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments. 

Broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns during the year led to a decline in global equity prices and wider credit spreads. As a result, net revenues in Equity investments reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities. The decrease in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year and lower net interest income. Incentive fees were significantly lower, primarily driven by harvesting in the prior year. Management and other fees were higher, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit spreads, as well as higher loan and deposit balances. 
 Provision for credit losses was 519 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of 169 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Operating expenses were 11.55 billion for 2022, essentially unchanged compared with 2021, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses related to NNIP, largely offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax earnings were 1.31 billion for 2022, compared with 10.73 billion for 2021. 
 2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Asset Wealth Management were 21.97 billion for 2021, 60 higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments, and higher Management and other fees. 
 The increase in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year. The increase in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-ups compared with net mark-downs in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. The increase in management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit balances. Incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. 
 Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of 169 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of 1.40 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Operating expenses were 11.41 billion for 2021, 20 higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). Pre-tax earnings were 10.73 billion for 2021, compared with 2.89 billion for 2020. 
 Assets Under Supervision. AUS includes our institutional clients assets, assets sourced through third-party distributors and high-net-worth clients assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.

 In addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning alternative assets). 
 We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s or a separately managed account s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were 3.33 billion as of December 2022, 3.39 billion as of December 2021 and 1.79 billion as of December 2020. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets. 
 Our target is to achieve annual firmwide management and other fees of more than 10 billion (including more than 2 billion from alternatives) in 2024.

 Operating Environment. During 2022, Platform Solutions operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. 
 In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively impacted. 

2022 versus 2021. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were 1.50 billion for 2022, 135 higher than 2021, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both Consumer platforms and Transaction banking and other. 
 The increase in Consumer platforms net revenues primarily reflected significantly higher credit card balances. The increase in Transaction banking and other net revenues reflected higher deposit balances. 
 Provision for credit losses was 1.73 billion for 2022, compared with 697 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio and net charge offs, while 2021 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, which was partially offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Operating expenses were 1.76 billion for 2022, 78 higher than 2021, reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms, primarily from the inclusion of operating expenses related to GreenSky. Pre-tax loss was 1.99 billion for 2022, compared with 1.05 billion for 2021. 
 2021 versus 2020. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were 640 million for 2021, 92 higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms and higher net revenues in Transaction banking and other. 
 Net revenues in Consumer platforms reflected higher credit card balances. Net revenues in Transaction banking and other reflected higher deposit balances. 
 Provision for credit losses was 697 million for 2021, 43 higher than 2020, primarily reflecting growth in the credit card portfolio, including approximately 185 million of the provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, partially offset by reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Operating expenses were 990 million for 2021, 57 higher than 2020, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms. Pre-tax loss was 1.05 billion for 2021, compared with 783 million for 2020.

 Balance Sheet and Funding Sources 
 Balance Sheet Management 
 One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital Management for information about our capital management process. 
 Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods. 
 In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses. 
 Balance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are: 
 To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; 
 To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and 
 To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. 
 Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. 

Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. See Risk Management Overview and Structure of Risk Management for an overview of our risk management structure. 
 Balance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions. 
 Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. 
 Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital Management for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.

 Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics 
 As of December 2022, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were 1.44 trillion, a decrease of 22.19 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in trading assets of 74.67 billion (primarily due to decreases in equity securities, corporate debt instruments, reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), customer and other receivables of 25.23 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), cash and cash equivalents of 19.21 billion (primarily reflecting our activity), partially offset by increases in investments of 41.91 billion (primarily due to an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity), collateralized agreements of 29.68 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), and loans of 20.72 billion (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). 
 As of December 2022, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were 1.32 trillion, a decrease of 29.45 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in collateralized financings of 75.91 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), partially offset by increases in deposits of 22.44 billion (primarily due to increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by other deposits), customer and other payables of 10.11 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), and trading liabilities of 9.90 billion (primarily due to an increase in equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in government obligations, both reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities). 
 Our total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were 110.35 billion as of December 2022 and 165.88 billion as of December 2021, which were 15 lower as of December 2022 and 3 higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 27 lower as of December 2022 and 14 higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2022, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from lower levels of our and our clients activities at the end of the period. 
 The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities. 

The table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios. 
 As of December 
 in millions 2022 2021 Total assets 1,441,799 1,463,988 Unsecured long-term borrowings 247,138 254,092 Total shareholders equity 117,189 109,926 Leverage ratio 12.3x 13.3x Debt-to-equity ratio 2.1x 2.3x 
 In the table above: 
 The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets. This ratio is different from the leverage ratios included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 The debt-to-equity ratio equals unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity. 
 The table below presents information about our shareholders equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders equity to tangible common shareholders equity. 
 As of December 
 in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 Total shareholders equity 117,189 109,926 Preferred stock (10,703) (10,703) Common shareholders equity 106,486 99,223 Goodwill (6,374) (4,285) Identifiable intangible assets (2,009) (418) Tangible common shareholders equity 98,103 94,520 Book value per common share 
 303.55 284.39 Tangible book value per common share 279.66 270.91 
 In the table above: 
 Tangible common shareholders equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders equity is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 
 Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 350.8 million as of December 2022 and 348.9 million as of December 2021. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

 Funding Sources 
 Our primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations. 
 The table below presents information about our funding sources. 
 As of December 
 in millions 2022 
 2021 
 Deposits 386,665 40 364,227 36 Collateralized financings 155,022 16 230,932 23 Unsecured short-term borrowings 60,961 6 46,955 5 Unsecured long-term borrowings 247,138 26 254,092 25 Total shareholders equity 117,189 12 109,926 11 Total 966,975 100 1,006,132 100 
 Our funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. 
 Deposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits. 

Secured Funding. We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA. 
 We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. 
 Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. 
 We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 2022 and 100 million as of December 2021. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings. 
 Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings. Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base. 
 The table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile. 
 in millions First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total As of December 2022 
 2024 18,136 11,053 9,964 11,858 51,011 2025 12,131 10,681 6,443 7,887 37,142 2026 5,862 3,835 3,278 9,227 22,202 2027 8,580 3,435 6,568 11,777 30,360 2028 - thereafter 106,423 Total 247,138 
 The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2022 was approximately six years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. We issued approximately 28 billion of benchmark debt during 2022, and we intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2023 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2022, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities. 
 Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders equity. 

Capital Management and Regulatory Capital 
 Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. 
 Capital Management 
 We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. 
 We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. 
 We principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. 
 We may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock and subordinated debt. 
 Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. 
 Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in Business Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
 As required by the FRB s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. 
 The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). 
 Based on our 2022 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.4 to 6.3 for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. As a result, beginning on October 1, 2022, our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement was 13.3 . Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, our G-SIB surcharge increased from 2.5 to 3.0 , resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.8 . See Share Repurchase Program for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends and Consolidated Regulatory Capital for further information about the G-SIB surcharge. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2022. See Business Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 
 GS Bank USA is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. GS Bank USA published a summary of its annual DFAST results in June 2022. See Business Available Information in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 

GSI, GSIB and GSBE also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators. 
 Contingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders. 
 Capital Attribution. We assess the capital usage of each of our businesses based on our attributed equity framework. This framework considers many factors, including our internal assessment of risks as well as the regulatory capital requirements related to our business activities. These regulatory capital requirements take into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is our CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Standardized Capital Rules. This requirement includes the SCB which is determined by the FRB based on its own annual stress test. 
 Share Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from 2.00 to 2.50 per share. During 2022, we returned a total of 6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of 3.50 billion and common stock dividends of 3.20 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we returned a total of 2.38 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of 1.50 billion and common stock dividends of 880 million. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2023 through February 23, 2023, our common stock repurchases were approximately 2.25 billion.

 See Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax (buyback tax) on the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases after December 31, 2022. The fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. Based on our current understanding, we do not expect the buyback tax to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2023. 
 Resolution Capital Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC (GS Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. 
 In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. 
 Rating Agency Guidelines 
 The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. 

The level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management Credit Ratings for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS Co. and GSI. 
 Consolidated Regulatory Capital 
 We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an Advanced approaches banking organization and have been designated as a G-SIB. 
 The capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5 buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge was 2.5 for 2022 and is 3.0 for 2023 and 2024. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points. 
 See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework. 
 Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 
 We are also subject to the FRB s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.

 Requirements TLAC to RWAs 21.5 TLAC to leverage exposure 9.5 External long-term debt to RWAs 8.5 External long-term debt to leverage exposure 4.5 
 In the table above: 
 The TLAC to RWAs requirement included (i) the 18 minimum, (ii) the 2.5 buffer, (iii) the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent and (iv) the 1.0 G-SIB surcharge (Method 1). Beginning in January 2023, our TLAC to RWAs requirement increased to 22.0 . 
 The TLAC to leverage exposure requirement includes (i) the 7.5 minimum and (ii) the 2.0 leverage exposure buffer. 
 The external long-term debt to RWAs requirement includes (i) the 6 minimum and (ii) the 2.5 G-SIB surcharge (Method 2). Beginning in January 2023, our external long-term debt to RWAs requirement increased to 9.0 . 
 The external long-term debt to total leverage exposure is the 4.5 minimum. 
 The table below presents information about our TLAC and external long-term debt ratios.

 43.7 44.0 TLAC to leverage exposure 15.9 15.6 External long-term debt to RWAs 25.4 25.8 External long-term debt to leverage exposure 9.3 9.1 
 In the table above: 
 TLAC includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by Group Inc. Eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements. 
 External long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years. 
 RWAs represent Advanced RWAs as of December 2022 and Standardized RWAs as of December 2021. In accordance with the TLAC rules, the higher of Advanced or Standardized RWAs are used in the calculation of TLAC and external long-term debt ratios and applicable requirements. 

Leverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
 In the second half of 2022, based on regulatory feedback, we revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 2021, this change would have reduced our TLAC to RWAs ratio of 44.0 by 0.8 percentage points and our External long-term debt to RWAs ratio of 25.8 by 0.5 percentage points. 
 See Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about TLAC. 
 Subsidiary Capital Requirements 
 Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 
 Bank Subsidiaries. GS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary non-U.S. banking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries. 
 U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. GS Co., our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC.

 GS Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1, of 22.21 billion as of December 2022 and 22.18 billion as of December 2021, which exceeded the amount required by 17.46 billion as of December 2022 and 17.74 billion as of December 2021. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of 5 billion and net capital in excess of 1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. GS Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than 6 billion. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GS Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements. 
 Non-U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. Our principal non-U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL. 
 GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). GSI is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III). 
 The table below presents GSI s risk-based capital requirements. 
 As of December 2022 2021 Risk-based capital requirements CET1 capital ratio 8.7 8.1 Tier 1 capital ratio 10.7 9.9 Total capital ratio 13.3 12.4 
 In the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future. 
 The table below presents information about GSI s risk-based capital ratios. 
 As of December 
 in millions 2022 2021 Risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets CET1 capital 31,780 28,810 Tier 1 capital 40,080 37,110 Tier 2 capital 5,377 5,377 Total capital 45,457 42,487 RWAs 247,653 269,762 Risk-based capital ratios 
 CET1 capital ratio 12.8 10.7 Tier 1 capital ratio 16.2 13.8 Total capital ratio 18.4 15.7 
 In the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSI s external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 9 basis points to the CET1 capital ratio as of December 2022. 

GSI is also subject to the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25 established by the PRA, which became effective in January 2023. GSI had a leverage ratio of 6.1 as of December 2022. The leverage ratio as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSI s external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 7 basis points to the leverage ratio as of December 2022. 
 GSI is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSI was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. 
 GSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and became fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSI was in compliance with this requirement. 
 GSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements. 
 
 Regulatory and Other Matters 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. 
 See Business Regulation in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.

 Other Matters 
 Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024. The FCA has proposed to allow the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain USD LIBOR settings in legacy USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts through September 2024. The U.S. federal banking agencies guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR. 
 The International Swaps and Derivatives Asso ciation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA s formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023. 
 We facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD LIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates and synthetic rates for us and our clients, and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR. 

Our risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of December 2022, the notional amount of our USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts was approximately 6 trillion, of which approximately 5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. Substantially all of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately 29.0 billion as of December 2022, of which 26.4 billion will contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. Under the FRB s final rule and the LIBOR Act, we will replace our USD LIBOR-based unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. This transition will take place following USD LIBOR cessation on June 30, 2023. In addition, our USD LIBOR-based loans were approximately 33.1 billion as of December 2022, of which approximately 30.5 billion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. A vast majority of such loans contain fallback provisions in the related loan agreements and we are actively engaging with our clients and syndicate partners to remediate the remaining loans agreements. 
 We have also issued de bt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: 
 Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; 
 Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; 
 Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and 
 Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. 
 We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. 
 We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes.

 Risk Management 
 Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. For further information about our risk management processes, see Overview and Structure of Risk Management, and for information about our areas of risk, see Liquidity Risk Management, Market Risk Management, Credit Risk Management, Operational Risk Management, Model Risk Management and Other Risk Management, as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview and Structure of Risk Management 
 Overview 
 We believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. 
 Governance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite. 

The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair and vice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. 
 The implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes is overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. 
 Our revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite. 
 Our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax. 
 Internal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 The three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line. 
 Processes. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and control assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk metrics, reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making. 
 Risk Identification and Control Assessment. We believe the identification of our risks and related control assessment is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and control assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. This approach also encompasses our control assessment, led by our second line of defense, to review and challenge the control environment to ensure it supports our strategic business plan. 
 To effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. 
 An important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital Management for further information. 

Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting. We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits and thresholds policy, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits. 
 The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. 
 Risk Metrics, Reporting and Monitoring. Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk metrics, reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Risk Decision-Making. Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. 
 We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions. 
 People. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels. 
 We reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards. 

Structure 
 Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We also have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee. 
 Membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members. 
 The chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.

 Management Committee. The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management. 
 Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits and thresholds policy, through delegated authority to the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. This committee also reviews new significant strategic business initiatives to determine whether they are consistent with our risk appetite and risk management capabilities. Additionally, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee performs enhanced reviews of significant risk events, the top residual and emerging risks, and the overall risk and control environment in each of our business units in order to propose uplifts, identify elements that are common to all business units and analyze the consolidated residual risks that we face. This committee, which reports to the Management Committee, is co-chaired by our president and chief operating officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chair is our chief financial officer, who is appointed as vice-chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The following are the primary committees or councils that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee (unless otherwise noted): 
 Firmwide Risk Council. The Firmwide Risk Council is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of relevant financial risks and related risk limits at the firmwide, business and product levels. This council is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer. 
 Firmwide New Activity Committee. The Firmwide New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new activities and for establishing a process to identify and review previously approved activities that are significant and that have changed in complexity and/or structure or present different reputational and suitability concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain appropriate. This committee is co-chaired by our controller and chief accounting officer and our chief operating and strategy officer for Engineering, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.

 Firmwide Conduct Committee. The Firmwide Conduct Committee is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks and policies which govern our conduct risks. Conduct risk is the risk that our people fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and related core values, policies or codes, or applicable laws or regulations, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities to us, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community. This committee is chaired by our chief legal officer, who is appoin ted as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. 
 Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee) is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of risk frameworks, policies and parameters related to our core risk management processes, as well as limits and thresholds, at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, this committee is responsible for overseeing our financial risks and reviews the results of stress tests and scenario analyses. To assist the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee in carrying out its mandate, a number of other risk committees with dedicated oversight for stress testing, model risks, Volcker Rule compliance, as well as our investments or other capital commitments that may give rise to financial risk, report into the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. This committee is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The Firmwide Capital Committee and Firmwide Commitments Committee report to the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee.

This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chairs are our chief legal officer and the head of Conflicts Resolution, who are appointed as vice-chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. This committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board. The Firmwide Suitability Committee reports to the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. 
 Firmwide Suitability Committee. The Firmwide Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across functions, regions and products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other committees. This committee is co-chaired by our chief compliance officer, and the head of Net Zero Transition Solutions in Global Banking Markets, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. 

Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. 
 
 Liquidity Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. 
 Treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite. 
 Liquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for identifying, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Liquidity Risk Management Principles 
 We manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan. 
 GCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. 
 Our GCLA reflects the following principles: 
 The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival; 
 Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; 
 During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and 
 As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. 

We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc. s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. 
 Asset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. 
 Our approach to asset-liability management includes: 
 Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Funding Sources for further information; 
 Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Balance Sheet Management for further information about our balance sheet management process and Funding Sources Secured Funding for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and 
 Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.

 Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. 
 Subsidiary Funding Policies 
 The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. 
 Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing. 

Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had 39.33 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; 47.74 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; 2.62 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; 52.55 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and 4.25 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: 108.14 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of 52.93 billion) and 30.16 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of December 2022. In addition, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. 
 Contingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. 
 The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.

 Stress Tests 
 In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about firmwide stress tests. 
 Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: 
 Severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and 
 A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. 
 The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: 
 Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; 
 A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; 
 Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; 
 No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and 

A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Intraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained. 
 Long-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. 
 Resolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. 
 In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.

 Limits 
 We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about the limit approval process. 
 Limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 
 GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics 
 GCLA. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2022 and December 2021 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities. 
 The table below presents information about our GCLA.

 In the table above: 
 The U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits. 
 The non-U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of non-U.S. government obligations (only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and U.K. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies. 

We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements. 
 Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged 273.49 billion for the three months ended December 2022, 271.65 billion for the three months ended December 2021, 275.69 billion for the year ended December 2022 and 249.32 billion for the year ended December 2021. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA. 
 Liquidity Regulatory Framework 
 As a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 . We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR. 
 The table below presents information about our average daily LCR.

 As a BHC, we are subject to a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, which requires large U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of our quarterly average daily NSFR on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization s stable funding sources. We will begin doing so in August 2023. Our NSFR as of December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. 
 The following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements: 
 GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100 under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 
 GSI and GSIB. GSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100 under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI s and GSIB s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K. As of December 2022, both GSI s and GSIB s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 
 GSBE. GSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100 under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U. As of December 2022, GSBE s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 
 Other Subsidiaries. We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. 
 The implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future. 

Credit Ratings 
 We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.

 We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of: 
 Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices; 
 Our level and variability of earnings; 
 Our capital base; 
 Our franchise, reputation and management; 
 Our corporate governance; and 
 The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution. 
 Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. 
 See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. 

Cash Flows 
 As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. 
 Year Ended December 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 19.21 billion to 241.83 billion at the end of 2022, primarily due to net cash used for investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments (primarily U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity) and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and deposits (reflecting increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits). The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from trading assets and liabilities, customer and other receivables and payables, net (reflecting both a decrease in customer and other receivables and an increase in customer and other payables), net earnings and loans held for sale, net, partially offset by cash outflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting both a decrease in collateralized financings and an increase in collateralized agreements). The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening during the year. Such amount was 11.56 billion for 2022 3.42 billion for the three months ended March 2022, 10.34 billion for the six months ended June 2022 and 18.17 billion for the nine months ended September 2022). 
 Year Ended December 2021 . Our cash and cash equivalents increased by 105.19 billion to 261.04 billion at the end of 2021, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits (reflecting increases across channels) and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments. 
 For an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December 2020, see Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Market Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Market risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions. Our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: 
 Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads; 
 Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; 
 Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and 
 Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. 
 Market Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. 
 Managers in revenue-producing units, Treasury and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units and Treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. 

Market Risk Management Process 
 Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the Overview and Structure of Risk Management, as well as the following: 
 Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; 
 Diversifying exposures; 
 Controlling position sizes; and 
 Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. 
 Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) and other stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. 
 Risk Measures 
 We produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. 
 We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, EaR and other stress tests. 
 Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions. 
 Value-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures. We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95 confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level. 

Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 101 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: 
 VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; 
 VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and 
 Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. 
 To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. 
 Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. 
 Our VaR measure does not include: 
 Positions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as held-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost; 
 Available-for-sale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss); 
 Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and 
 The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. 
 We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. 

Earnings-at-Risk. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we started managing our interest rate risk using the EaR metric. EaR measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR complements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 Differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments. 
 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates. 
 Certain interest rate sensitive fees. 
 Treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses through our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. We measure EaR over a one-year time horizon following a 100-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market s expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. This scenario includes contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior. We manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. While management uses the best information available to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process. 
 Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, and Treasury, have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring EaR through firmwide oversight, including oversight of EaR stress testing and assumptions, and the establishment of our EaR risk appetite.

 Stress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. In addition to EaR, we use other stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about firmwide stress tests. 
 Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. 
 Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. 
 Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). 
 Limits 
 We use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about the limit approval process. 
 Limits are monitored by Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted. 

Metrics 
 We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. 
 The table below presents our average daily VaR. 
 Year Ended December in millions 2022 2021 Categories Interest rates 97 60 Equity prices 33 43 Currency rates 32 13 Commodity prices 47 25 Diversification effect (95) (55) Total 114 86 
 Our average daily VaR increased to 114 million in 2022 from 86 million in 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures. The total increase was driven by increases in the interest rates, commodity prices and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the equity prices category. 
 The table below presents our period-end VaR. 
 As of December 
 in millions 2022 2021 Categories Interest rates 108 69 Equity prices 27 31 Currency rates 35 19 Commodity prices 18 30 Diversification effect (85) (58) Total 103 91 
 Our period-end VaR increased to 103 million as of December 2022 from 91 million as of December 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures. The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the commodity prices category. 
 During 2022, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on six occasions (all of which occurred during March 2022) primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. These limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide VaR risk limit and subsequent risk reductions. During this period, the firmwide VaR risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility. During 2021, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit.

 Credit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of 1 million as of both December 2022 and December 2021. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of 37 million as of December 2022 and 33 million as of December 2021. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. 
 Earnings-at-Risk. The table below presents the impact of a parallel shift in rates on our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over the next 12 months relative to the baseline scenario.

 In the table above: 
 The EaR metric utilized various assumptions, including, among other things, balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior, all of which have inherent uncertainties. The EaR metric does not represent a forecast of our net revenues and preferred stock dividends. 
 The change in our sensitivities as of December 2022 compared to December 2021 primarily reflects the impact of changes in our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. 
 The -100 basis points parallel shift in rates scenario was not meaningful as of December 2021 given the low interest rate environment. 

Other Market Risk Considerations 
 We make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets. 
 Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures 
 We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections above, to monitor market risk across the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings. The related gains and losses on these positions are included in market making, other principal transactions, interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and debt valuation adjustment and unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

 Credit Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. 
 Credit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk. 
 Credit Risk Management Process 
 Our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the Overview and Structure of Risk Management, as well as the following: 
 Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; 
 Establishing or approving underwriting standards; 
 Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; 
 Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; 
 Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and 
 Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. 

We also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. We determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty s industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. 
 Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral value, FICO credit scores and other risk factors. 
 Our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. 
 Risk Measures 
 We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.

 Stress Tests 
 We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about firmwide stress tests. 
 To supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary. 

Limits 
 We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about the limit approval process. 
 Credit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 
 Risk Mitigants 
 To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. 
 For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. 
 When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.

 Credit Exposures 
 As of December 2022, our aggregate credit exposure decreased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting decreases in receivables from clearing organizations and cash deposits with central banks, partially offset by an increase in loans and lending commitments. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting a decrease in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposures are described further below. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks. 
 The table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.

 The table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of 16.94 billion as of December 2022 and 24.87 billion as of December 2021. 
 OTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. 

We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. 
 The table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region. 
 As of December

 Our credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2022 remained low, representing less than 2 of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives. 
 In the table above: 
 OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). 
 Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.

 Credit Hedges. To mitigate the credit risk associated with our lending activities, we obtain credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes. 

Securities Financing Transactions. We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.

 Other Credit Exposures. We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.

 Selected Exposures 
 We have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices. 

Country Exposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively affect the global economy and has resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Governments around the world have responded to Russia s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on specific industry sectors, companies and individuals in Russia. Retaliatory restrictions against investors, non-Russian owned businesses and other sovereign states have been implemented by Russia. Businesses in the U.S. and globally continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine presents heightened risks relating to cyber attacks, limited ability to settle securities transactions, third-party and agent bank dependencies, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, as well as the potential for increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. Complying with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has resulted in increased operational risk. The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict. 
 Our senior management, risk committees and the Board receive regular briefings from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including our chief risk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian exposures, as well as other relevant risk metrics. We have significantly reduced our exposure to Russia and Ukraine and have curtailed our operations in Russia to those necessary to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. The overall direct financial impact to our net revenues for 2022 from Russian and Ukrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers and related instruments was not material. We have established a firmwide working group to identify and assess the operational risk associated with complying with economic sanctions and restrictions as a result of this invasion. In addition, to mitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, we liaise with government agencies in order to update our monitoring processes with the latest information. 
 Our total credit exposure to Russian or Ukrainian counterparties or borrowers and our total market exposure relating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was not material as of December 2022. 
 In addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in Argentina, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela have led to concerns about their financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to each of these countries was not material as of December 2022.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See Stress Tests for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. 

Operational Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters. 
 Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: 
 Execution, delivery and process management; 
 Business disruption and system failures; 
 Employment practices and workplace safety; 
 Clients, products and business practices; 
 Damage to physical assets; 
 Internal fraud; and 
 External fraud. 
 Operational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. 

Operational Risk Management Process 
 Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the Overview and Structure of Risk Management, including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. 
 We combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management. 
 We maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring operational resilience of our business. 
 Our operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. 
 We have established policies that require all employees and consultants to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. 
 We use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Risk Measurement 
 We measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: 
 Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; 
 The degree of automation in our processes; 
 New activity information; 
 The legal and regulatory environment; and 
 Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. 
 The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See Overview and Structure of Risk Management for information about firmwide stress tests. 
 Types of Operational Risks 
 Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cybersecurity risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows: 
 Information and Cybersecurity Risk. Information and cybersecurity risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about information and cybersecurity risk. 

Third-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk. 
 Business Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, including updated resilience capabilities as and when they become available. Our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. See Business Business Continuity and Information Security in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about business continuity. 

Model Risk Management 
 Overview 
 Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. 
 Model Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

116 
 Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 Our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework. 
 Model Review and Validation Process 
 Model Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. 
 We regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. 
 The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: 
 The model s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; 
 The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; 
 The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; 
 The model s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; 
 The model s consistency with models for similar products; and 
 The model s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. 
 See Critical Accounting Policies Fair Value Review of Valuation Models, Liquidity Risk Management, Market Risk Management, Credit Risk Management and Operational Risk Management for further information about our use of models within these areas. 

Other Risk Management 
 In addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also manage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance and conflicts. These areas of risks are discussed below. 

Capital Risk Management 
 Capital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See Capital Management and Regulatory Capital for further information about our capital management process. 
 We have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. In addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements. 
 Our process for managing capital risk also includes independent review by Risk that, among other things, assesses regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalates certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and performs calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules. 
 Climate Risk Management 
 We categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis 

 As a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program. 
 We have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments. 
 See Business Sustainability in Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition. 
 Compliance Risk Management 
 Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. 

Conflicts Management 
 Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term conflict of interest does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. 
 We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. 
 As a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Global Banking Markets and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer. 
 We regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of December 31, 2022, management conducted an assessment of the firm s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was effective. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 The firm s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID ), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 120 to 122, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. 

Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments 
 As described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes 26.0 billion of financial assets and 22.8 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as one or more inputs to the financial instrument s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii) correlation. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management s process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management s significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management s process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.

 Allowance for Loan Losses - Wholesale Loan Portfoli o 
 As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio reflects management s estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, 2.6 billion of the allowance for loan losses and 150.4 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The procedures also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and methodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio.

 In the table above: 
 Changes in fair value are presented for all trading cash instruments that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period. 
 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to trading cash instruments that were still held at period-end. 
 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If a trading cash instrument was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3. 
 For level 3 trading cash instrument assets, increases are shown as positive amounts, while decreases are shown as negative amounts. For level 3 trading cash instrument liabilities, increases are shown as negative amounts, while decreases are shown as positive amounts. 
 Level 3 trading cash instruments are frequently economically hedged with level 1 and level 2 trading cash instruments and/or level 1, level 2 or level 3 derivatives. Accordingly, gains or losses that are classified in level 3 can be partially offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1 or level 2 trading cash instruments and/or level 1, level 2 or level 3 derivatives. As a result, gains or losses included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary for Trading Cash Instruments 
 Year Ended December 2022 . The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of billion (reflecting million of net realized gains and billion of net unrealized losses) for 2022 included gains/(losses) of ) billion reported in market making and million reported in interest income. 
 The net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2022 primarily reflected losses on certain equity securities (included in other cash instruments), principally driven by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. 
 Transfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity securities (included in other cash instruments) and corporate debt instruments from both level 1 and level 2 (in each case, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 
 Transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments). 
 Year Ended December 2021. The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of million (reflecting million of net realized gains and million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of million reported in market making and million reported in interest income. 
 The drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2021 were not material. 
 Transfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments, and reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 
 Transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments, and loans and securities backed by real estate to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments).

 In the table above: 
 Changes in fair value are presented for all derivative assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period. 
 Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to instruments that were still held at period-end. 
 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If a derivative was transferred into level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3. 
 Positive amounts for transfers into level 3 and negative amounts for transfers out of level 3 represent net transfers of derivative assets. Negative amounts for transfers into level 3 and positive amounts for transfers out of level 3 represent net transfers of derivative liabilities. 
 A derivative with level 1 and/or level 2 inputs is classified in level 3 in its entirety if it has at least one significant level 3 input. 
 If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain or loss from adjusting only observable inputs (i.e., level 1 and level 2 inputs) is classified in level 3. 
 Gains or losses that have been classified in level 3 resulting from changes in level 1 or level 2 inputs are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1 or level 2 derivatives and/or level 1, level 2 and level 3 trading cash instruments. As a result, gains/(losses) included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

 billion (reflecting million of net realized gains and billion of net unrealized gains) for 2022 included gains of billion reported in market making and gains of million reported in other principal transactions. 
 The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2022 were attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in equity prices), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in commodity prices), gains on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and an increase in interest rates), and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates). 
 Transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity derivative liabilities from level 2 (principally due to decreased transparency of certain unobservable volatility inputs used to value these derivatives), partially offset by transfers of certain commodity derivative assets from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable electricity price inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these derivatives). 
 Transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2022 primarily reflected transfers of certain interest rate derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable volatility inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives), certain credit derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable credit spread inputs no longer being significant to the net risk of certain portfolios), and certain commodity derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable natural gas spread and electricity price inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives), partially offset by transfers of certain equity derivative liabilities to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable volatility inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives).

The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2021 were primarily attributable to gains on certain credit and currency derivatives (in each case, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in commodity prices) and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices). 
 The drivers of transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2021 were not material. 
 Transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain interest rate derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to increased transparency of certain volatility inputs used to value these derivatives).

 Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment. 
 Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the investment. 
 The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one investment. For example, the highest multiple for private equity securities is appropriate for valuing a specific private equity security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other private equity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments. 
 Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. 
 Corporate debt securities, securities backed by real estate and other debt obligations are valued using discounted cash flows, and equity securities are valued using market comparables and discounted cash flows.

 Gains/(losses) include both realized and unrealized gains and losses. Gains/(losses) exclude related interest income and interest expense. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. 
 Gains/(losses) included in market making are primarily related to the firm s trading assets and liabilities, including both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. 
 Gains/(losses) are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities because many of the firm s market-making and client facilitation strategies utilize financial instruments across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.

 Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive, by August 2025, at least billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection with this guarantee, the firm is also required to make a one-time interim payment of million towards the billion if the Government of Malaysia has not received at least million in assets and proceeds by August 2022. The firm considers the reports that it receives on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August, in evaluating the progress of Malaysia s recovery efforts. The firm and the Government of Malaysia disagree about and, following an extension of the contractual dispute resolution period, continue to discuss whether the Government of Malaysia did, in fact, recover at least million as of August 2022 and whether any interim payment was due. If the parties are unable to resolve this dispute, it would be settled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by the firm would, in any event, be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets and proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed billion.

 VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR. 
 The firm s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its regulatory VaR on one occasion during each of the years ended 2022 and 2021. There was no change in the firm s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs; 
 Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress; 
 Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon; 
 Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm s credit correlation positions; and 
 Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed.

RWAs Rollforward Commentary 
 Year Ended December 2022. Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2022 decreased by billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting a decrease in derivatives (principally due to reduced exposures) and a decrease in equity investments (principally due to reduced exposures as a result of sales and unrealized losses). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility). 
 Advanced Credit RWAs as of December 2022 increased by billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, other credit RWAs and securities financing transactions (principally due to updates to the probability of default models in the fourth quarter of 2022). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to reduced exposures as a result of sales and unrealized losses). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by billion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2022 increased by billion compared with December 2021, primarily associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.

 GS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a well-capitalized depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the well-capitalized requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors.

 business segments: Global Banking Markets, Asset Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. See Note 1 for information about the firm s business segments, including the changes made during 2022. 
 Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm s other business segments. 
 The firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the three business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments. 
 The allocation of common shareholders equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. 
 Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment s pre-tax earnings. 
 Management believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.

 million facility agreement (the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak Finance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts will not have jurisdiction over GSI s action unless and until the Portuguese Administrative Court finds against BoP in GSI s parallel action.

In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee s decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately million related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the million sought by the Liquidation Committee.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Company s common stock. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation and the Company s amended and restated by-laws, which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Pursuant to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, the Company s authorized capital stock consists of 4,350,000,000 shares, each with a par value of 0.01 per share, of which 4,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock and 200,000,000 shares are designated as nonvoting common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. 
 The Company s Shareholders Agreement governs, among other things, the voting of shares of common stock owned by participating managing directors of the Company. Shares of common stock subject to the Company s Shareholders Agreement are called voting shares. Before any of the Company s shareholders vote, a separate, preliminary vote is held by the persons covered by the Company s Shareholders Agreement. In the election of directors, all voting shares will be voted in favor of the election of the director nominees receiving the highest numbers of votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary vote. For all other matters, all voting shares will be voted in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary vote. 
 Common Stock 
 Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. There are no cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock voting in a contested election of directors can elect all the directors if they choose to do so, subject to any voting rights of holders of preferred stock to elect directors. In an uncontested director election, a director must receive a majority of the votes cast for or against the director to be elected. 
 Subject to the preferential rights of any holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of common stock, together with the holders of the nonvoting common stock, are entitled to such dividends and distributions, whether payable in cash or otherwise, as may be declared from time to time by the Company s board of directors from legally available funds. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, upon the Company s liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment of all prior claims, the holders of common stock, with the shares of the common stock and the nonvoting common stock being considered as a single class for this purpose, will be entitled to receive pro rata all the Company s assets. Holders of common stock have no redemption or conversion rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for securities of the Company. 
 Nonvoting Common Stock 
 The nonvoting common stock has the same rights and privileges as, ranks equally and shares proportionately with, and is identical in all respects as to all matters to, the common stock, except that the nonvoting common stock has no voting rights other than those voting rights required by law. 
 Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 
 The Company is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes a merger, asset sale or a transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in certain cases, within the preceding three years, did own) 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between the Company and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions 
 prior to the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the Company must have previously approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
 on consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the Company 
 -2- 

outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder), those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer or 
 at or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 The Company s board of directors has adopted a resolution providing that the shareholders agreement will not create an interested stockholder. 
 Certain Anti-Takeover Matters 
 The Company s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with the Company s board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include 
 Constituency Provision 
 In accordance with the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, a director of the Company may (but is not required to) in taking any action (including an action that may involve or relate to a change or potential change in control of the Company), consider, among other things, the effects that the Company s actions may have on other interests or persons (including its employees, former partners of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and the community) in addition to the Company s shareholders. 
 Advance Notice Requirements 
 The Company s amended and restated by-laws establish advance notice procedures with regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of shareholders of the Company. These procedures provide that notice of such shareholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of the Company prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. The time periods vary depending on the nature of the proposal. The notice must contain certain information specified in the amended and restated by-laws and must otherwise comply with the amended and restated by-laws. 
 Limitation on Ability of Shareholders to Call Special Meetings 
 The Company s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide procedures pursuant to which holders of record of not less than 25 of the voting power of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock may call a special meeting of shareholders. The Company s amended and restated by-laws impose certain procedural requirements on shareholders requesting such a meeting (including the provision of the same information required for shareholder proposals at annual meetings under the Company s advance notice by-law provisions described above), as well as qualifications designed to prevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings. 
 No Written Consent of Shareholders 
 The Company s restated certificate of incorporation requires all shareholder actions to be taken by a vote of the shareholders at an annual or special meeting, and does not permit the Company s shareholders to act by written consent without a meeting. 
 Blank Check Preferred Stock 
 The Company s restated certificate of incorporation provides for 150,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable the board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of the Company, the board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without shareholder approval in one or more private offerings or other 
 -3- 

transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquiror or insurgent shareholder or shareholder group. In this regard, the restated certificate of incorporation grants the Company s board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of the Company. 
 Listing 
 The common stock of the Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol GS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1 1,000 TH INTEREST IN A SHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A 
 DESCRIPTION OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK 
 The depositary is the sole holder of the Company s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the Series A Preferred Stock ), and all references herein to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company s authorized preferred stock. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally to each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds for such payment i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series A Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10 th day of February, May, August and November of each year (each, a dividend payment date ). These dividends accrue, with respect to each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.75 above LIBOR (as described below) on the related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 3.75 . In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. 
 Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a dividend record date ). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 -5- 

A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the immediately preceding day that is a business day. 
 For any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period. 
 If the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, LIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period. 
 Under the Federal Reserve System s FRB final rule and the Adjustable Interest Rate Act LIBOR Act ), on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR will be replaced with three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any dividend period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 The term Moneyline Telerate Page means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, on the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service. 
 The term business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 
 Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company, or a duly authorized committee of the board, does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will not 
 -6- 

accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend payment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. 
 So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 When dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared upon the Series A Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series A Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Series A Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 -7- 

For purposes of this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Redemption 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Series A Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company s option, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 If shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof provided that, if the depositary shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 See Description of Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Company s Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy 
 The SEC had previously approved the application of the Company and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to be supervised by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity CSE pursuant to the SEC s rules at that time relating to CSEs (referred to as the CSE Rules ). The Company treated the Series A Preferred Stock as allowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as Allowable Capital ). 
 If the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted, at the Company s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of preferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this conversion right as follows. 
 If both of the following occur 
 the Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or guidance (together, regulations relating to the Company s capital adequacy, which regulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) provides for a type or level of capital characterized as Tier 1 or its equivalent pursuant to regulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the Company s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board or any other United States national governmental body, or any other applicable regime based on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its successor, or (iii) provides for a type of capital that in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such Tier 1 capital (such capital described in either (ii) or (iii) is referred to below as Tier 1 Capital Equivalent ), and

the Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series A Preferred Stock for such Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of the Series A Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations, 
 then, upon such affirmative election, the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company s option into a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series A Preferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the Company determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred stock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company could agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified period or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, since such a restriction would be permitted in the Company s discretion under the terms and provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The Company will provide notice to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series A Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to convert the Series A Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of any such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at the Company s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder. 
 As used above, the term Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions means the terms that are, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be treated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) pursuant to applicable regulations. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series A Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 If and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each 
 -9- 

subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of any dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 amend or alter the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed above under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy, will not be deemed to adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series A Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series A Preferred Stock 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designation for the Series A Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been 
 -10- 

redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 Please note that as used in this section, references to holders of depositary shares mean those who own depositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. 
 General 
 The Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1 1,000 th ownership interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series A Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares 
 If the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (or 25 per depositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
 In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares and any multiple thereof. 
 Voting the Series A Preferred Stock 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the Series A Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series A Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the holder s depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not 
 -11- 

receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with instructions received. 
 Listing 
 The depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GS PrA. 
 Form of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares 
 The depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series A Preferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1 1,000 TH INTEREST IN A SHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES C 
 DESCRIPTION OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK 
 The depositary is the sole holder of the Company s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the Series C Preferred Stock ), and all references herein to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series C Preferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company s authorized preferred stock. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Shares of the Series C Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds for such payment i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series C Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company. 
 The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy. The Series C Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10 th day of February, May, August, and November of each year (each, a dividend payment date ). These dividends accrue, with respect to each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.75 above LIBOR (as described below) on the related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 4.00 . In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. 
 Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series C Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a dividend record date ). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 -13- 

A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series C Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the immediately preceding day that is a business day. 
 For any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period. 
 If the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, LIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period. 
 Under the FRB s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR will be replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any dividend period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 The term Moneyline Telerate Page means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, on the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service. 
 The term business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 
 Dividends on shares of Series C Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company, or a duly authorized committee of the board, does not declare a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will not accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend payment 
 -14- 

date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. 
 So long as any share of Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 When dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series C Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series C Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series C Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared upon the Series C Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series C Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series C Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series C Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series C Preferred Stock) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series C Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Series C Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 -15- 

For purposes of this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series C Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Redemption 
 The Series C Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Series C Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company s option, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 If shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof provided that, if the depositary shares representing the Series C Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series C Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, such shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 See Description of Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Company s Series C Preferred Stock. 
 Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy 
 The Company was previously regulated by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity CSE pursuant to the SEC s rules at that time relating to CSEs (referred to as the CSE Rules ). The Company treated the Series C Preferred Stock as allowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as Allowable Capital ). 
 If the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series C Preferred Stock may be converted, at the Company s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of preferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this conversion right as follows. 
 If both of the following occur 
 the Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or guidance (together, regulations relating to the Company s capital adequacy, which regulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) provides for a type or level of capital characterized as Tier 1 or its equivalent pursuant to regulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the Company s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board or any other United States national governmental body, or any other applicable regime based on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its successor, or (iii) provides for a type of capital that in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such Tier 1 capital (such capital described in either (ii) or (iii) is referred to below as Tier 1 Capital Equivalent ), and 
 -16- 

the Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series C Preferred Stock for such Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of the Series C Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations, 
 then, upon such affirmative election, the Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company s option into a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series C Preferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the Company determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred stock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company could agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified period or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, since such a restriction would be permitted in the Company s discretion under the terms and provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 The Company will provide notice to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series C Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to convert the Series C Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of any such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at the Company s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder. 
 As used above, the term Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions means the terms that are, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be treated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) pursuant to applicable regulations. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and provided further that the Company s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series C Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Series C Preferred Stock, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series C Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 -17- 

If and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of any dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 amend or alter the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series C Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series C Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock. In addition, any conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed above under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy, will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series C Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series C Preferred Stock 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designation for the Series C Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 -18- 

The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 Please note that as used in this section, references to holders of depositary shares mean those who own depositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. 
 General 
 The Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1 1,000 th ownership interest in a share of Series C Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series C Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series C Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series C Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series C Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series C Preferred Stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares 
 If the Company redeems the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock (or 25 per depositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing shares of Series C Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
 In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares and any multiple thereof. 
 Voting the Series C Preferred Stock 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the Series C Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series C Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by the holder s depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series C Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all reasonable actions that 
 -19- 

the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Series C Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with instructions received. 
 Listing 
 The depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GS PrC. 
 Form of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares 
 The depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series C Preferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1 1,000 TH INTEREST IN A SHARE OF FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES D 
 DESCRIPTION OF SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK 
 The depositary is the sole holder of the Company s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D (the Series D Preferred Stock ), and all references herein to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The Series D Preferred Stock is part of a single series of authorized preferred stock. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Shares of the Series D Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds for such payment i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series D Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company. 
 The Series D Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company, except under certain limited circumstances described below under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy. The Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series D Preferred Stock. The Series D Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10 th day of February, May, August, and November of each year (each, a dividend payment date ). These dividends accrue, with respect to each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) 0.67 above LIBOR (as described below) on the related LIBOR determination date (as described below) or (2) 4.00 . In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. 
 Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series D Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a dividend record date ). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for the Series D Preferred Stock. 
 -21- 

A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series D Preferred Stock are computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the immediately preceding day that is a business day. 
 For any dividend period, LIBOR shall be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 (or any successor or replacement page) as of 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period. 
 If the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750 (or any successor or replacement page), LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, LIBOR for the new dividend period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior dividend period. 
 Under the FRB s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR will be replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any dividend period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subscription uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 The term Moneyline Telerate Page means the display on Moneyline Telerate, Inc., or any successor service, on the page or pages specified herein or any replacement page or pages on that service. 
 The term business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 
 Dividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Series D Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will not accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend payment 
 -22- 

date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. 
 So long as any share of Series D Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Series D Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 When dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series D Preferred Stock) in full upon the Series D Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared upon the Series D Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series D Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series D Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series D Preferred Stock) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series D Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Series D Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Series D Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 -23- 

For purposes of this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Redemption 
 The Series D Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Series D Preferred Stock is currently redeemable at the Company s option, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series D Preferred Stock. 
 If shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof provided that, if the depositary shares representing the Series D Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series D Preferred Stock, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 See Description of Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Company s Series D Preferred Stock. 
 Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy 
 The Company was previously regulated by the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity CSE pursuant to the SEC s rules relating to CSEs (referred to as the CSE Rules ). The Company treated the Series D Preferred Stock as allowable capital in accordance with the CSE Rules (such capital is referred to below as Allowable Capital ). 
 If the regulatory capital requirements that apply to the Company change in the future, the Series D Preferred Stock may be converted, at the Company s option and without consent of the holders, into a new series of preferred stock, subject to the limitations described below. The Company will be entitled to exercise this conversion right as follows. 
 If both of the following occur 
 the Company (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or guidance (together, regulations relating to the Company s capital adequacy, which regulation (i) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital, (ii) provides for a type or level of capital characterized as Tier 1 or its equivalent pursuant to regulations of any governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company (or any of the Company s subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board or any other United States national governmental body, or any other applicable regime based on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its successor, or (iii) provides for a type of capital that in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such Tier 1 capital (such capital described in either (ii) or (iii) is referred to below as Tier 1 Capital Equivalent ), and 
 -24- 

the Company affirmatively elects to qualify the Series D Preferred Stock for such Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of the Series D Preferred Stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such regulations, 
 then, upon such affirmative election, the Series D Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the Company s option into a new series of preferred stock having terms and provisions substantially identical to those of the Series D Preferred Stock, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and such limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), to comply with the Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions (defined below), provided that the Company will not cause any such conversion unless the Company determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of such new series of preferred stock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. For example, the Company could agree to restrict its ability to pay dividends on or redeem the new series of preferred stock for a specified period or indefinitely, to the extent permitted by the terms and provisions of the new series of preferred stock, since such a restriction would be permitted in the Company s discretion under the terms and provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock. 
 The Company will provide notice to holders of the Series D Preferred Stock of any election to qualify the Series D Preferred Stock for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to convert the Series D Preferred Stock into a new series of preferred stock, promptly upon the effectiveness of any such election or determination. A copy of any such notice and of the relevant regulations will be on file at the Company s principal offices and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder. 
 As used above, the term Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions means the terms that are, in the Company s judgment (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be treated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Company elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) pursuant to applicable regulations. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and provided further that the Company s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series D Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Series D Preferred Stock, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series D Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted.

If and when dividends for at least four dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for four dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Company may take account of any dividend the Company elects to pay for such a dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 amend or alter the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series D Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series D Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, any conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events, as discussed above under Regulatory Changes Relating to Capital Adequacy, will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series D Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series D Preferred Stock 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designation for the Series D Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 -26- 

The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 Please note that as used in this section, references to holders of depositary shares mean those who own depositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. 
 General 
 The Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1 1,000 th ownership interest in a share of Series D Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series D Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series D Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series D Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series D Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series D Preferred Stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares 
 If the Company redeems the Series D Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock (or 25 per depositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing shares of Series D Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
 In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares and any multiple thereof. 
 Voting the Series D Preferred Stock 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the Series D Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series D Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series D Preferred Stock represented by the holder s depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series D Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all reasonable actions that 
 -27- 

the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Series D Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with instructions received. 
 Listing 
 The depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GS PrD. 
 Form of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares 
 The depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series D Preferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1 1,000 TH INTEREST IN A SHARE OF 5.50 FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES J 
 DESCRIPTION OF SERIES J PREFERRED STOCK 
 The depositary is the sole holder of the Company s 5.50 Fixed-To-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J (the Series J Preferred Stock ), and all references herein to the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series C Preferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series J Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The Series J Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company s authorized preferred stock. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series J Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series J Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Shares of the Series J Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds for such payment i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series J Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of Series J Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company. 
 The Series J Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company. The Series J Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series J Preferred Stock. The Series J Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series J Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10 th day of February, May, August and November of each year (each, a dividend payment date ). These dividends accrue, with respect to each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to 5.50 from the original issue date to, but excluding, May 10, 2023, and, thereafter at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.64 on the related LIBOR determination date. In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series J Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. 
 Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series J Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a dividend record date ). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for the Series J Preferred Stock. 
 A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series J Preferred Stock for any period beginning prior to May 10, 2023 
 -29- 

are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, and dividends for periods beginning on or after such date will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day unless, after May 10, 2023, such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the immediately preceding day that is a business day. Business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 For any dividend period commencing on or after May 10, 2023, LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Reuters screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page) as of approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period. 
 If the rate described above does not so appear on the Reuters screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page), then LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two of the requested quotations described above are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M., New York City time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If no quotation is provided as described above, then the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to any of the foregoing quotations or display page, or any such source as it deems reasonable from which to estimate LIBOR or any of the foregoing lending rates, shall determine LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in its sole discretion. 
 Under the FRB s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR will be replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any dividend period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 
 The term Reuters screen means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra service, or any successor or replacement service. 
 Dividends on shares of Series J Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Series J Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will not 
 -30- 

accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend payment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. 
 So long as any share of Series J Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Series J Preferred Stock, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Series J Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company s junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 When dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series J Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series J Preferred Stock) in full on the Series J Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared on the Series J Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series J Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series J Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series J Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series J Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series J Preferred Stock) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Series J Preferred Stock, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series J Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series J Preferred Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Company fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Company to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations. The restated certificate of incorporation provides that dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock may not be declared or set aside for payment if and to the extent such dividends would cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Series J Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series J Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 The Series J Preferred Stock may be fully subordinate to interests held by the U.S. government in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding, including a proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
 -31- 

In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of Series J Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Series J Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series J Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of the Company s Series J Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 For purposes of this description of the Series J Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series J Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Redemption 
 The Series J Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date, and is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Company may, at its option, redeem the Series J Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any date on or after May 10, 2023, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, in each case, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current dividend period to but excluding the redemption date, whether or not declared. Holders of Series J Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series J Preferred Stock. 
 The Company is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company treats the Series J Preferred Stock as tier 1 capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency). 
 A Regulatory Capital Treatment Event means the good faith determination by the Company that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series J Preferred Stock, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series J Preferred Stock, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Series J Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Company will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share of Series J Preferred Stock then outstanding as tier 1 capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so long as any share of Series J Preferred Stock is outstanding. Appropriate federal banking agency means the appropriate federal banking agency with respect to the Company as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provision. 
 The Company will not exercise its option to redeem any shares of preferred stock without obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) if then required by applicable law. Unless the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) authorizes the Company to do otherwise in writing, the Company will redeem the Series J Preferred Stock only if it is replaced with other tier 1 capital that is not a restricted core capital element e.g. , common stock or another series of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock). 
 If shares of Series J Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof provided that, if the depositary shares representing the Series J Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of Series J Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series J Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such 
 -32- 

redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series J Preferred Stock, such shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series J Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as the Company may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 See Description of Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Company s Series J Preferred Stock. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of Series J Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the Company s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series J Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. 
 These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of Series J Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for four consecutive dividend periods following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Series J Preferred Stock, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series J Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series J Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 If and when dividends for four consecutive dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of Series J Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of Series J Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series J Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 amend or alter the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series J Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 -33- 

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J Preferred Stock, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series J Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of Series J Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series J Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series J Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series J Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series J Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J Preferred Stock, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series J Preferred Stock 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designation for the Series J Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series J Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 Please note that as used in this section, references to holders of depositary shares mean those who own depositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. 
 General 
 The Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1 1,000 th ownership interest in a share of Series J Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series J Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series J Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series J Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series J Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series J Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any 
 -34- 

property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series J Preferred Stock. 
 The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by the Company on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares 
 If the Company redeems the Series J Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, the depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series J Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1 1,000 th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series J Preferred Stock (or 25 per depositary share). Whenever the Company redeems shares of Series J Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing shares of Series J Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
 In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable. In any such case, the Company will redeem depositary shares only in increments of 1,000 shares and any multiple thereof. 
 Voting the Series J Preferred Stock 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of Series J Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the Series J Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series J Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of Series J Preferred Stock represented by the holder s depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of Series J Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. The Company will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Series J Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with instructions received. 
 Listing 
 The depositary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GS PrJ. 
 Form of Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares 
 The depositary shares are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. The Series J Preferred Stock is issued in registered form to the depositary.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPOSITARY SHARES, EACH REPRESENTING 1 1,000 TH INTEREST IN A SHARE OF 6.375 FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES K 
 DESCRIPTION OF SERIES K PREFERRED STOCK 
 The depositary is the sole holder of the Company s 6.375 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series K (the Series K Preferred Stock ), and all references herein to the holders of the Series K Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following is a brief description of the material terms of the Series K Preferred Stock. The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series K Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. The Series K Preferred Stock is part of a single series of the Company s authorized preferred stock. The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the Series K Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of the Series K Preferred Stock, up to the maximum number of authorized but unissued shares. 
 Shares of the Series K Preferred Stock rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, the Company will generally be able to pay dividends and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up only out of lawfully available funds for such payment i.e. , after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The Series K Preferred Stock is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more stock of the Company. 
 The Series K Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company. The Series K Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Series K Preferred Stock. The Series K Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is not a bank deposit and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, nor is it the obligation of, or guaranteed by, a bank. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Series K Preferred Stock are not mandatory. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date, quarterly in arrears on the 10 th day of February, May, August and November of each year (each, a dividend payment date ). These dividends accrue, with respect to each dividend period, on the liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) at a rate per annum equal to 6.375 from the original issue date to, but excluding, May 10, 2024 (or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day), and, thereafter at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.55 on the related LIBOR determination date. In the event that the Company issues additional shares of Series K Preferred Stock after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date the Company specifies at the time such additional shares are issued. 
 Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series K Preferred Stock as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before that dividend payment date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such dividend payment date (each, a dividend record date ). These dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. The corresponding record dates for the depositary shares are the same as the record dates for the Series K Preferred Stock. 
 -36- 

A dividend period is the period from and including a dividend payment date to but excluding the next dividend payment date. Dividends payable on the Series K Preferred Stock for any period beginning prior to May 10, 2024 will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, and dividends for periods beginning on or after such date will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the dividend period. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a business day, then the dividend payment date will be the next succeeding business day unless, after May 10, 2024, such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the dividend payment date will be the immediately preceding day that is a business day. Business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 For any dividend period commencing on or after May 10, 2024, LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Reuters screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page) as of approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period. 
 If the rate described above does not so appear on the Reuters screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page), then LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two of the requested quotations described above are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M., New York City time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If no quotation is provided as described above, then the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to any of the foregoing quotations or display page, or any such source as it deems reasonable from which to estimate LIBOR or any of the foregoing lending rates, shall determine LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in its sole discretion. 
 
 Under the FRB s final rule and the LIBOR Act, on the first London business day following June 30, 2023, LIBOR will be replaced with three-month term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any dividend period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 
 The term Reuters screen means the display on the Reuters 3000 Xtra service, or any successor or replacement service.

Dividends on shares of Series K Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Series K Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend will not accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that dividend period on the dividend payment date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. 
 So long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a dividend period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Series K Preferred Stock, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Series K Preferred Stock either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 When dividends are not paid (or duly provided for) on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series K Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series K Preferred Stock) in full on the Series K Preferred Stock and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared on the Series K Preferred Stock and all such equally ranking securities payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series K Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series K Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series K Preferred Stock and all parity stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series K Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series K Preferred Stock) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Series K Preferred Stock, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Series K Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Series K Preferred Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Series K Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Company fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Company to fail to comply, with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The restated certificate of incorporation provides that dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock may not be declared or set aside for payment if and to the extent such dividends would cause the Company to fail to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Series K Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Series K Preferred Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 -38- 

The Series K Preferred Stock, like the Company s other series of preferred stock, may be fully subordinate to any interests held by the U.S. government in the event of a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding, including a proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
 In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of Series K Preferred Stock and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Series K Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series K Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of the Company s Series K Preferred Stock and any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 For purposes of this description of the Series K Preferred Stock, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series K Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Redemption 
 The Series K Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date, and is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. The Company may, at the Company s option, redeem the Series K Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any date on or after May 10, 2024 (or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day), or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, in each case, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share (equivalent to 25 per depositary share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the then-current dividend period to but excluding the redemption date, whether or not declared. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series K Preferred Stock. 
 The Company is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company treats the Series K Preferred Stock as tier 1 capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency). 
 A Regulatory Capital Treatment Event means the good faith determination by the Company that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series K Preferred Stock, (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Series K Preferred Stock, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Series K Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Company will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of 25,000 per share of Series K Preferred Stock then outstanding as tier 1 capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock is outstanding. Appropriate federal banking agency means the appropriate federal banking agency with respect to the Company as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provision. 
 The Company will not exercise its option to redeem any shares of preferred stock without obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as required by applicable law. Unless the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) authorizes the Company to do otherwise in writing, the Company will redeem the Series K Preferred Stock only if it is replaced with other tier 1 capital that is not a restricted core capital element e.g. , common stock or another series of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock). 
 If shares of Series K Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof provided that, if the depositary shares representing the Series K Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company, or DTC, the 
 -39- 

Company may give such notice in any manner permitted by the DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth (i) the redemption date, (ii) the number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing shares of Series K Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series K Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series K Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series K Preferred Stock, such shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series K Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot. 
 See Description of Depositary Shares below for information about redemption of the depositary shares relating to the Company s Series K Preferred Stock. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of Series K Preferred Stock have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the Company s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series K Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of Series K Preferred Stock and any such series of voting preferred stock for four consecutive dividend periods following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Series K Preferred Stock, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Series K Preferred Stock either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series K Preferred Stock and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 If and when dividends for four consecutive dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of Series K Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of Series K Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series K Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 -40- 

amend or alter the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series K Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series K Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of Series K Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock, taken as a whole 
 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series K Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Series K Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Series K Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K Preferred Stock, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series K Preferred Stock 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designation for the Series K Preferred Stock that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series K Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of Series K Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES 
 Please note that as used in this section, references to holders of depositary shares mean those who own depositary shares registered in their own names, on the books that the Company or the depositary maintain for this purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in street name or issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company. 
 General 
 The Company has issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1 1,000 th ownership interest in a share of Series K Preferred Stock and evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Series K Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, the depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series K Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series K Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 -41- 

Dividends and Other Distributions 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series K Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Series K Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with the Company s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series K Preferred Stock.

The Company will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares representing the Series K Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares of that series held by it proportionately with instructions received.

DESCRIPTION OF (i) 5.793 FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NORMAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL SECURITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL II (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) AND (ii) FLOATING RATE NORMAL AUTOMATIC PREFERRED ENHANCED CAPITAL SECURITIES OF GOLDMAN SACHS CAPITAL III (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the 5.793 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital II and the Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital III (the APEX and of the Trust Agreements (both as defined below) under which they are issued. It does not purport to be complete. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The APEX and the Common Securities of Goldman Sachs Capital II Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III Capital III ), each a Delaware statutory trust (a Trust ), represent beneficial interests in the relevant Trust. The Trust in respect of Capital II holds the Company s Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E (the Series E Preferred Stock ), and the Trust in respect of Capital III holds the Company s Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F (the Series F Preferred Stock, and collectively with the Series E Preferred Stock, the Preferred ). 
 Each holder of APEX has a beneficial interest in the relevant Trust but does not own any specific shares of the Preferred held by that Trust. However, the applicable trust agreement among the Company, The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, the administrative trustees and the several holders of the relevant Trust securities (each, a Trust Agreement under which each Trust operates defines the financial entitlements of its APEX in a manner that causes those financial entitlements to correspond to the financial entitlements of that Trust in the Preferred it holds. Accordingly, each APEX of Capital II corresponds to 1 100th of a share of Series E Preferred Stock held by Capital II and each APEX of Capital III corresponds to 1 100th of a share of Series F Preferred Stock held by Capital III. 
 The Trusts 
 Each Trust is a statutory trust organized under Delaware law pursuant to a Trust Agreement and the filing of a certificate of trust with the Delaware Secretary of State. 
 The Trusts are used solely for the following purposes 
 issuing the APEX and the Common Securities 
 holding shares of the Preferred and 
 engaging in other activities that are directly related to the activities described above. 
 The Company owns all of the Common Securities, either directly or indirectly. The Common Securities rank equally with the APEX and the Trusts make payment on their Trust securities pro rata , except that if the Company pays less than the full dividend on or redemption price of the Preferred, the rights of the holders of the Common Securities to payment in respect of distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise are subordinated to the rights of the holders of the APEX. 
 Each Trust is perpetual, but may be dissolved earlier as provided in its Trust Agreement. 
 The Company pays all fees and expenses related to the Trusts. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE APEX 
 General 
 The APEX are securities of each Trust and are issued pursuant to the applicable Trust Agreement. The Property Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, acts as indenture trustee for the APEX under the Trust Agreement for purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Each APEX has a liquidation amount of 1,000. 
 The terms of the APEX of each Trust include those stated in the Trust Agreement for such Trust, including any amendments thereto and those made part of the Trust Agreement by the Trust Indenture Act and the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. 
 -43- 

In addition to the APEX, each Trust Agreement authorizes the administrative trustees of the Trust to issue the Common Securities on behalf of the Trust. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the Common Securities. The Common Securities rank on a parity, and payments upon redemption, liquidation or otherwise are made on a proportionate basis, with the APEX except as set forth below under Ranking of Common Securities. The Trust Agreements do not permit the Trust to issue any securities other than the Common Securities and the APEX or to incur any indebtedness. 
 Under the Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee on behalf of the relevant Trust holds the Preferred for the benefit of the holders of its APEX and Common Securities. 
 The payment of distributions out of money held by a Trust, and payments upon redemption of the APEX or liquidation of the Trust, are guaranteed by the Company to the extent described under Description of the Guarantees. Each Guarantee, when taken together with the Company s obligations under the applicable Trust Agreement, including its obligations to pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the Trust, other than with respect to its Common Securities and APEX, has the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the APEX. The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Guarantee Trustee, holds each Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the APEX. The Guarantees do not cover payment of distributions when the Trusts do not have sufficient available funds to pay those distributions. 
 When the term holder is used in this description of the APEX with respect to a registered APEX, it means the person in whose name such APEX is registered in the security register. The APEX are currently held in book-entry form only, and are held in the name of DTC or its nominee. 
 Capital II s APEX are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GS PE and Capital III s APEX are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GS PF. 
 The financial entitlements as a holder of APEX generally correspond to the applicable Trust s financial entitlements as a holder of the Preferred. The corresponding asset for each APEX is a 1 100 th , or 1,000, interest in one share of Preferred held by the Trust. Each Trust will pass through to the holder amounts that it receives on the corresponding assets for the APEX as distributions on, or the liquidation preference of, APEX. Holders of a Trust s APEX are be entitled to receive distributions corresponding to non-cumulative dividends on the Preferred held by the Trust. These cash dividends are payable if, as and when declared by the Company s board of directors, on the Dividend Payment Dates (as defined below), which are quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if such day is not a business day, the next business day). 
 Assuming that the Company does not elect to pay partial dividends or to skip dividends on the Preferred, holders of APEX will receive distributions on the 1,000 liquidation amount per APEX at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) three-month LIBOR for the related distribution period plus 0.765 (in the case of Capital II s APEX) or 0.77 (in the case of Capital III s APEX) and (y) 4.000 , payable quarterly on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 (or if any such date is not a business day, on the next business day). 
 Dividends are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the number of days actually elapsed in the dividend period. Distributions on the APEX and dividends on the Preferred are non-cumulative. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon acts as registrar and transfer agent, or Transfer Agent, for the APEX. If The Bank of New York Mellon should resign or be removed, the Company or the Trust will designate a successor and the term Transfer Agent as used herein will refer to that successor. A business day as used in this section means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions and trust companies in New York, New York or Wilmington, Delaware are permitted or required by any applicable law to close. 
 Each Trust must make distributions on its APEX on each distribution date to the extent that it has funds available therefor. A Trust s funds available for distribution to a holder of its APEX will be limited to payments received from the Company on the Preferred held by the Trust. The Company guarantees the payment of distributions on the APEX out of moneys held by each Trust to the extent of available Trust funds, as described under Description of the Guarantees below. 
 Distributions on the APEX are payable to holders as they appear in the security register of the Trust on the relevant record dates. The record dates are the fifteenth calendar day immediately preceding the next succeeding distribution date. Distributions are paid through the Property Trustee or paying agent, who hold amounts received in respect of the Preferred for the benefit of the holders of the APEX. 
 For more information about dividends on the Preferred, see Dividends below. 
 -44- 

Agreed Tax Treatment of the APEX 
 As a beneficial owner of APEX, by acceptance of the beneficial interest therein, the holder will be deemed to have agreed, for all U.S. federal income tax purposes 
 to treat the holder as the owner of a 1 100th interest in a share of the relevant Preferred and 
 to treat the Trust as one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements. 
 Mandatory Redemption of APEX upon Redemption of the Preferred 
 The APEX have no stated maturity but must be redeemed on the date the Company redeems the Preferred, and the Property Trustee or paying agent will apply the proceeds from such repayment or redemption to redeem a like amount, as defined below, of the APEX. The Preferred is perpetual but the Company may redeem it on any Dividend Payment Date, subject to certain limitations. See Redemption below. The redemption price per APEX will equal the redemption price of the Preferred. See Redemption below. If notice of redemption of any Preferred has been given and if the funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of the Preferred so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, those shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares (including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 If less than all of the shares of the Preferred held by the Trust are to be redeemed on a redemption date, then the proceeds from such redemption will be allocated pro rata to the redemption of the APEX and the Common Securities, except as set forth below under Ranking of Common Securities. 
 The term like amount as used above means APEX having a liquidation amount equal to that portion of the liquidation amount of the Preferred to be contemporaneously redeemed, the proceeds of which will be used to pay the redemption price of such APEX. 
 Distributions to be paid on or before the redemption date for any APEX called for redemption will be payable to the holders as of the record dates for the related dates of distribution. If the APEX called for redemption are no longer in book-entry form, the Property Trustee, to the extent funds are available, will irrevocably deposit with the paying agent for the APEX funds sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price and will give such paying agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of their certificates evidencing the APEX. 
 If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit 
 all rights of the holders of such APEX called for redemption will cease, except the right of the holders of such APEX to receive the redemption price and any distribution payable in respect of the APEX on or prior to the redemption date, but without interest on such redemption price and 
 the APEX called for redemption will cease to be outstanding. If any redemption date is not a business day, then the redemption amount will be payable on the next business day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). However, if payment on the next business day causes payment of the redemption amount to be in the next calendar month, then payment will be on the preceding business day. 
 If payment of the redemption amount for the Preferred held by a Trust called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and accordingly the redemption amount of the Trust s APEX is not paid either by the Trust or by the Company under the applicable Guarantee, then dividends on the Preferred called for redemption will continue to accrue and distributions on such series of APEX called for redemption will continue to accumulate at the applicable rate then borne by such APEX from the original redemption date scheduled to the actual date of payment. In this case, the actual payment date will be considered the redemption date for purposes of calculating the redemption amount. 
 Redemptions of the APEX will require prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 The Company will not exercise its option to redeem any shares of the Preferred without obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as required by applicable law. Unless the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency) authorizes the Company to do otherwise in writing, the Company will redeem the Preferred only if it is replaced with other tier 1 capital that is not a restricted core capital element e.g. , common stock or another series of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock). 
 -45- 

If less than all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred held by a Trust are to be redeemed on a redemption date, then the aggregate liquidation amount of APEX and Common Securities of that Trust to be redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the APEX and Common Securities based upon the relative liquidation amounts of such series, except as set forth below under Ranking of Common Securities. The Property Trustee will select the particular APEX to be redeemed on a pro rata basis not more than 60 days before the redemption date from the outstanding APEX not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, or if the APEX are in book-entry only form, in accordance with the procedures of DTC. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Transfer Agent in writing of the APEX selected for redemption and, in the case of any APEX selected for redemption in part, the liquidation amount to be redeemed. 
 For all purposes of the Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of APEX shall relate, in the case of any APEX redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate liquidation amount of APEX that has been or is to be redeemed. If less than all of the APEX, the APEX held through the facilities of DTC will be redeemed pro rata in accordance with DTC s internal procedures. 
 Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution 
 Pursuant to each Trust Agreement, the applicable Trust shall dissolve on the first to occur of 
 certain events of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Company 
 redemption of all of its APEX as described above and 
 the entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 Except as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early dissolution occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Property Trustee and the administrative trustees will liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as they determine possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder of its APEX a like amount of the Preferred held by the Trust as of the date of such distribution. Except as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early dissolution occurs as a result of the entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Property Trustee will liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as it determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder of its APEX a like amount of the Preferred held by the Trust as of the date of such distribution. The Property Trustee shall give notice of liquidation to each holder of APEX at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date of liquidation. 
 If, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, the Property Trustee determines that distribution of the Preferred in the manner provided above is not possible, or if the early dissolution occurs as a result of the redemption of all the APEX, the Property Trustee shall liquidate the property of the Trust and wind up its affairs. In that case, upon the winding up of the Trust, except with respect to an early dissolution that occurs as a result of the redemption of all the APEX, the holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to holders and after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount per Trust security plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of payment. If, upon any such winding up, the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full such aggregate liquidation distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on its Trust securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis, except as set forth below under Ranking of Common Securities. 
 The term like amount as used above means Preferred having a liquidation preference equal to the liquidation amount of the APEX of the holder to whom such Preferred would be distributed. 
 Distribution of Trust Assets 
 Upon liquidation of a Trust other than as a result of an early dissolution upon the redemption of all the APEX and after satisfaction of the liabilities of creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, the assets of the Trust will be distributed to the holders of such Trust securities in exchange therefor. 
 After the liquidation date fixed for any distribution of assets of the Trust 
 the APEX will no longer be deemed to be outstanding 
 DTC or its nominee, as the record holder of the APEX, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Preferred to be delivered upon such distribution 
 -46- 

any certificates representing the APEX not held by DTC or its nominee will be deemed to represent shares of the Preferred having a Liquidation Preference equal to the APEX until such certificates are so surrendered for transfer and reissuance and 
 all rights of the holders of the APEX will cease, except the right to receive Preferred upon such surrender. 
 Since each APEX corresponds to 1 100 th of a share of Preferred, holders of APEX may receive fractional shares of the Preferred or depositary shares representing the Preferred upon this distribution. 
 Ranking of Common Securities 
 If on any distribution date a Trust does not have funds available from dividends on the Preferred it holds to make full distributions on its APEX and Common Securities, then the available funds from dividends on the Preferred it holds shall be applied first to make distributions then due on its APEX on a pro rata basis on such distribution date up to the amount of such distributions corresponding to dividends on the Preferred (or if less, the amount of the corresponding distributions that would have been made on the APEX had the Company paid a full dividend on the Preferred) before any such amount is applied to make a distribution on the Trust s Common Securities on such distribution date. 
 If on any date where APEX and Common Securities must be redeemed because the Company is redeeming Preferred and a Trust does not have funds available from the Company s redemption of the Preferred it holds to pay the full redemption price then due on all of its outstanding APEX and Common Securities to be redeemed, then (i) the available funds shall be applied first to pay the redemption price on the APEX to be redeemed on such redemption date and (ii) Common Securities shall be redeemed only to the extent funds are available for such purpose after the payment of the full redemption price on the APEX to be redeemed. 
 If an early dissolution event occurs in respect of a Trust, no liquidation distributions shall be made on its Common Securities until full liquidation distributions have been made on its APEX. 
 In the case of any event of default under the Trust Agreement of a Trust resulting from the Company s failure to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations as issuer of the Preferred held by the Trust, including obligations set forth in its restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or restated certificate of incorporation, or arising under applicable law, the Company, as holder of its Common Securities, will be deemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such event of default under the Trust Agreement until the effect of all such events of default with respect to its APEX have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all events of default under the Trust Agreement have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the holders of its APEX and not on the Company s behalf, and only the holders of its APEX will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. 
 Events of Default Notice 
 Any one of the following events constitutes an event of default under a Trust Agreement, or a Trust Event of Default, regardless of the reason for such event of default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body 
 the failure to comply in any material respect with the Company s obligations as issuer of the Preferred, under its restated certificate of incorporation, or those of the Trust, or arising under applicable law 
 the default by the Trust in the payment of any distribution on any Trust security of the Trust when such becomes due and payable, and continuation of such default for a period of 30 days 
 the default by the Trust in the payment of any redemption price of any Trust security of the Trust when such becomes due and payable 
 the failure to perform or the breach, in any material respect, of any other covenant or warranty of the trustees in the Trust Agreement for 90 days after the defaulting trustee or trustees have received written notice of the failure to perform or breach in the manner specified in such Trust Agreement or 
 the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Property Trustee and the Company s failure to appoint a successor Property Trustee within 90 days. 
 -47- 

Within 30 days after any Trust Event of Default with respect to a Trust actually known to the Property Trustee occurs, the Property Trustee will transmit notice of such Trust Event of Default to the holders of its APEX and to the administrative trustees, unless such Trust Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. The Company, as sponsor, and the administrative trustees are required to file annually with the Property Trustee a certificate as to whether or not the Company or the administrative trustees are in compliance with all the conditions and covenants applicable to the Company and to the administrative trustees under the Trust Agreement. 
 Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of a Trust 
 A Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to the Company or any other person, except as described below or as otherwise described in its Trust Agreement. A Trust may, at the Company s request, with the consent of the administrative trustees but without the consent of the holders of its APEX, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, a trust organized as such under the laws of any state if 
 such successor entity either 
 expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to its APEX, or 
 substitutes for its APEX other securities having substantially the same terms as its APEX, or the Successor Securities, so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as its APEX in priority with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise 
 a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is appointed to hold the Preferred then held by or on behalf of the Property Trustee 
 such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause its APEX, including any Successor Securities, to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
 such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of its APEX, including any Successor Securities, in any material respect 
 such successor entity has purposes substantially identical to those of the Trust 
 prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Property Trustee has received an opinion from counsel to the Trust experienced in such matters to the effect that 
 such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of its APEX, including any Successor Securities, in any material respect, and 
 following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or Investment Company Act 
 the Trust has received an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, conveyance, transfer or lease will not cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 
 the Company or any permitted successor or assignee owns all of the common securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Trust may not, except with the consent of holders of 100 in liquidation amount of its APEX, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, 
 -48- 

conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as other than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements or to be classified as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Voting Rights Amendment of a Trust Agreement 
 Except as provided herein and under Amendments and Assignment below and as otherwise required by law and the Trust Agreement, the holders of a Trust s APEX have no voting rights or control over the administration, operation or management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties to its Trust Agreement, including in respect of the Preferred held by the Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, however, the Property Trustee is required to obtain their consent before exercising some of its rights in respect of these securities. 
 Trust Agreement . The Company and the administrative trustees may amend a Trust s Trust Agreement without the consent of the holders of its APEX, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, unless in the case of the first two bullets below such amendment will materially and adversely affect the interests of any holder of APEX or the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee or impose any additional duty or obligation on the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, to 
 cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provisions in the Trust Agreement that may be inconsistent with any other provision, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Trust Agreement, which may not be inconsistent with the other provisions of the Trust Agreement 
 modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of the Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Trust will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation at all times that any Trust securities are outstanding, or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 
 provide that certificates for the APEX may be executed by an administrative trustee by facsimile signature instead of manual signature, in which case such amendment(s) shall also provide for the appointment by the Company of an authentication agent and certain related provisions 
 require that holders that are not U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes irrevocably appoint a U.S. person to exercise any voting rights to ensure that the Trust will not be treated as a foreign trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes or 
 conform the terms of the Trust Agreement to the description of the Trust Agreement, the APEX and the Common Securities in the prospectus dated December 5, 2006, of the Company and the Trusts, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated May 8, 2007, in the manner provided in the Trust Agreement. 
 Any such amendment shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Property Trustee, the Delaware Trustee and the holders of the APEX. 
 The Company and the administrative trustees may generally amend a Trust s Trust Agreement with 
 the consent of holders representing not less than a majority, based upon liquidation amounts, of its APEX and 
 receipt by the administrative trustees of the Trust of an opinion of counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the administrative trustees of the Trust or the administrative trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust s status as one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes or affect the Trust s exemption from status as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 However, without the consent of each affected holder of Trust securities, a Trust Agreement may not be amended to 
 change the amount or timing, or otherwise adversely affect the amount, of any distribution required to be made in respect of Trust securities as of a specified date or 
 -49- 

restrict the right of a holder of Trust securities to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date. 
 Preferred Stock . So long as Preferred is held by the Property Trustee on behalf of a Trust, the trustees of the Trust will not waive any rights in respect of the Preferred without obtaining the prior approval of the holders of at least a majority in liquidation amount of its APEX then outstanding. The trustees of the Trust shall also not consent to any amendment to the Trust s or the Company s governing documents that would change the dates on which dividends are payable or the amount of such dividends, without the prior written consent of each holder of APEX. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals from holders, the administrative trustees shall obtain, at the Company s expense, an opinion of counsel to the effect that such action shall not cause the Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 General . Any required approval of holders of APEX may be given at a meeting of holders convened for such purpose or pursuant to written consent. The Property Trustee will cause a notice of any meeting at which holders are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such holders is to be taken, to be given to each record holder in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement. 
 No vote or consent of the holders of APEX will be required for a Trust to redeem and cancel the APEX in accordance with a Trust Agreement. 
 Notwithstanding that holders of the APEX are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the APEX that are owned by the Company or its affiliates or the trustees shall be deemed not to be outstanding. 
 Payment and Paying Agent 
 Payments on the APEX shall be made to DTC, which shall credit the relevant accounts on the applicable distribution dates. If any APEX are not held by DTC, such payments shall be made by check mailed to the address of the holder as such address shall appear on the register. 
 The paying agent is The Bank of New York Mellon and any co-paying agent chosen by the Property Trustee and acceptable to the Company and to the administrative trustees. 
 Registrar and Transfer Agent 
 The Bank of New York Mellon acts as registrar and transfer agent, or Transfer Agent, for the APEX. 
 Information Concerning the Property Trustee 
 Other than during the occurrence and continuance of a Trust Event of Default, the Property Trustee undertakes to perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement. After a Trust Event of Default, the Property Trustee must exercise the same degree of care and skill as a prudent individual would exercise or use in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to this provision, the Property Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Trust Agreement at the request of any holder of APEX unless it is offered indemnity satisfactory to it by such holder against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred. If no Trust Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, construe ambiguous provisions in the Trust Agreement or is unsure of the application of any provision of the Trust Agreement, and the matter is not one upon which holders of APEX are entitled under the Trust Agreement to vote, then the Property Trustee will take any action that the Company directs. If the Company does not provide direction, the Property Trustee may take any action that it deems advisable and in the interests of the holders of the Trust securities and will have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct. 
 The Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the Property Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
 Trust Expenses 
 Pursuant to each Trust Agreement, the Company, as sponsor, agrees to pay 
 all debts and other obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to its APEX)

 Miscellaneous

 In this regard, the Company and the administrative trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the certificate of trust of a Trust or its Trust Agreement, that the Company and the administrative trustees determine to be necessary or desirable to achieve such end, as long as such action does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the APEX. 
 Holders of the APEX have no preemptive or similar rights. The APEX are not convertible into or exchangeable for the Company s common stock or preferred stock. 
 Subject to any applicable rules of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor appropriate federal banking agency), the Company or its affiliates may from time to time purchase any of the APEX that are then outstanding by tender, in the open market or by private agreement. 
 The Trust may not borrow money or issue debt or mortgage or pledge any of its assets. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE GUARANTEES 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the Guarantee (as defined below) pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement for Goldman Sachs Capital II (formerly known as Goldman Sachs Capital IV), dated as of March 23, 2016, and the Guarantee Agreement for Goldman Sachs Capital III (formerly known as Goldman Sachs Capital V), dated as of March 23, 2016 (collectively, the Guarantee Agreements ). The description does not purport to be complete. 
 General 
 The following payments on each Trust s APEX, also referred to as the guarantee payments, if not fully paid by the Trust, will be paid by the Company under a guarantee, or Guarantee, that the Company has executed and delivered for the benefit of the holders of such APEX. Pursuant to each Guarantee, the Company irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay in full the guarantee payments, without duplication 
 any accumulated and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the APEX, to the extent the Trust has funds available to make the payment 
 the redemption price for any APEX called for redemption, to the extent the Trust has funds available to make the payment and 
 upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Trust, other than in connection with a distribution of a like amount of corresponding assets to the holders of the APEX, the lesser of 
 the aggregate of the liquidation amount and all accumulated and unpaid distributions on the APEX to the date of payment, to the extent the Trust has funds available to make the payment and 
 the amount of assets of the Trust remaining available for distribution to holders of the APEX upon liquidation of the Trust. 
 -51- 

The Company s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Company to the holders of the APEX or by causing the Trust to pay the amounts to the holders. 
 If the Company does not make a regular dividend payment on the Preferred held by a Trust, the Trust will not have sufficient funds to make the related payments on the relevant series of APEX. The Guarantee does not cover payments on the APEX when the Trust does not have sufficient funds to make these payments. Because the Company is a holding company, its rights to participate in the assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors except to the extent that the Company may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. The Guarantee does not limit the incurrence or issuance by the Company of other secured or unsecured indebtedness. 
 Each Guarantee is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The Bank of New York Mellon acts as Guarantee Trustee for each Guarantee for purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. The Guarantee Trustee holds each Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of APEX. 
 Effect of the Guarantees 
 Each Guarantee, when taken together with the Company s obligations and the Trust s obligations under the Trust Agreement, including the obligations to pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the applicable Trust, other than with respect to its Trust securities, has the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of payments due on its APEX. 
 The Company has also agreed separately to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of each Trust with respect to its Common Securities to the same extent as the Guarantee. 
 Status of the Guarantees 
 Each Guarantee is unsecured and ranks 
 subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company s senior and subordinated debt and 
 equally with any of the Company s other present or future obligations that by their terms rank pari passu with such Guarantee. 
 Each Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed party may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without suing any other person or entity. Each Guarantee is held for the benefit of the holders of APEX. Each Guarantee will be discharged only by payment of the guarantee payments in full to the extent not paid by the applicable Trust. 
 Amendments and Assignment 
 A Guarantee may be amended only with the prior approval of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the applicable outstanding APEX. No vote is required, however, for any changes that do not adversely affect the rights of holders of APEX in any material respect. All guarantees and agreements contained in the Guarantee bind the Company s successors, assignees, receivers, trustees and representatives and are for the benefit of the holders of the applicable APEX then outstanding. 
 Termination of the Guarantees 
 A Guarantee will terminate 
 upon full payment of the redemption price of all applicable APEX or 
 upon full payment of the amounts payable in accordance with the Trust Agreement upon liquidation of the Trust. 
 A Guarantee will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any holder of APEX must restore payment of any sums paid under the APEX or the Guarantee. 
 -52- 

Events of Default 
 An event of default under a Guarantee will occur if the Company fails to perform any payment obligation or if the Company fails to perform any other obligation under the Guarantee and such default remains unremedied for 30 days. 
 The holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the applicable APEX have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee in respect of a Guarantee or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under the Guarantee. Any holder of APEX may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Company to enforce the Guarantee Trustee s rights and the Company s obligations under a Guarantee, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Trust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other person or entity. 
 As guarantor, the Company is required to file annually with the Guarantee Trustee a certificate as to whether or not the Company is in compliance with all applicable conditions and covenants under the Guarantee. 
 Information Concerning the Guarantee Trustee 
 Prior to the occurrence of an event of default relating to a Guarantee, the Guarantee Trustee is required to perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Guarantees. Following the occurrence of an event of default, the Guarantee Trustee will exercise the same degree of care as a prudent individual would exercise in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Provided that the foregoing requirements have been met, the Guarantee Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Guarantees at the request of any holder of APEX, unless offered indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby. 
 The Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the Guarantee Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. 
 Governing Law 
 The Guarantees are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 
 Limited Purpose of Trust 
 The Trust securities evidence beneficial interests in the Trust. A principal difference between the rights of a holder of a Trust security and a holder of Preferred is that a holder of Preferred would be entitled to receive from the issuer the dividends, redemption payments and payment upon liquidation in respect of Preferred while a holder of Trust securities is entitled to receive distributions from a Trust, or from the Company under a Guarantee, if and to the extent the Trust has funds available for the payment of such distributions. 
 Rights upon Dissolution 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Trust, holders of each series of APEX will receive the distributions described under Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution above. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company, the holders of the Preferred would be preferred shareholders of the Company, entitled to the preferences upon liquidation described under Description of the Preferred below. Since the Company is the guarantor under the Guarantee and has agreed to pay for all costs, expenses and liabilities of the Trust, other than the Trust s obligations to the holders of the Trust securities, the positions of a holder of APEX relative to other creditors and to the Company s shareholders in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy are expected to be substantially the same as if that holder held the corresponding assets of the Trust directly. 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the Preferred held by the relevant Trust. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, which is an exhibit to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. 
 General 
 The Company s authorized capital stock includes 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share (including the Preferred). 
 -53- 

Shares of the Preferred rank senior to the Company s common stock, equally with each other series of the Company s preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and at least equally with each other series of preferred stock that the Company may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Preferred), with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Preferred is fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders have paid their purchase price in full and that the Company may not ask them to surrender additional funds. Holders of the Preferred do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more preferred stock of the Company. The Preferred is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of stock or other securities of the Company. The Preferred has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company to redeem or repurchase the Preferred. 
 The Preferred has a fixed liquidation preference of 100,000 per share. If the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs, holders of the Preferred will be entitled to receive, out of the Company s assets that are available for distribution to shareholders, an amount per share equal to the liquidation preference per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to any undeclared dividends. 
 Unless the Trust is dissolved prior to the redemption of the Preferred, holders of APEX will not receive shares of the Preferred, and their interest in the Preferred will be represented by their APEX. If the Trust is dissolved, the Company may elect to distribute depositary shares representing the Preferred instead of fractional shares. Since the Preferred is held by the Property Trustee, holders of APEX are only able to exercise voting or other rights with respect to the Preferred through the Property Trustee. 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on shares of the Preferred are not mandatory. Holders of the Preferred are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board), out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the date of their issuance. These dividends are payable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each, for purposes of this section, a Dividend Payment Date ), with respect to the Dividend Period, or portion thereof, ending on the day preceding the respective Dividend Payment Date, at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) three-month LIBOR for the related distribution period plus 0.765 (in the case of the Series E Preferred Stock) or 0.77 (in the case of the Series F Preferred Stock) and (y) 4.000 . 
 Dividends are payable to holders of record of the Preferred as they appear on the Company s books on the applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before that Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, for purposes of this section, a Dividend Record Date ). These Dividend Record Dates apply regardless of whether a particular Dividend Record Date is a business day. 
 A Dividend Period is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date. If any that would otherwise be a Dividend Payment Date is not a business day, then the next business day will be the applicable Dividend Payment Date. 
 The amount of dividends payable per share of the Preferred on each Dividend Payment Date is calculated by multiplying the per annum Dividend Rate in effect for that Dividend Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of days in that Dividend Period and the denominator of which is 360, and multiplying the rate obtained by 100,000. 
 For any Dividend Period, LIBOR shall be determined by Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as calculation agent for the Preferred, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period, as the case may be, in the following manner 
 LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such period, as that rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page) as of 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be. 
 If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 (or any successor or replacement page), LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11 00 A.M., London time, on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by the calculation agent three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the 
 -54- 

first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, and in a Representative Amount. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. 
 If fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, LIBOR for the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11 00 A.M. New York City time on the second London business day immediately preceding the first day of such Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be, by three major banks in New York City selected by the calculation agent three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a Representative Amount. 
 If fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent are quoting as described above, LIBOR for the new Dividend Period will be LIBOR in effect for the prior Dividend Period or Interest Period, as the case may be. 
 The calculation agent s determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Company s principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 This subsection uses several terms that have special meanings relevant to calculating LIBOR. Those terms have the following meanings 
 The term Representative Amount means an amount that, in the calculation agent s judgment, is representative of a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. 
 Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page means the display designated on the Reuters 3000 Xtra (or such other page as may replace that page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. Dollar deposits). 
 The term business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 
 The term London business day means a day that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and is a day on which dealings in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. If the Company determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend, the Company will provide prior written notice to the Property Trustee, who will notify holders of APEX, and the administrative trustees. 
 Dividends on the Preferred are not cumulative. Accordingly, if the board of directors of the Company (or a duly authorized committee of the board) does not declare a dividend on the Preferred payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Company will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Preferred are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 So long as any share of Preferred remains outstanding, no dividend shall be paid or declared on the Company s common stock or any other shares of the Company s junior stock (as defined below) (other than a dividend payable solely in junior stock), and no common stock or other junior stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of junior stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of junior stock and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of junior stock), during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividends for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Preferred have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). However, the foregoing provision shall not restrict the ability of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or any of the Company s other affiliates, to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company s junior stock in the ordinary course of business. 
 As used in this description of the Preferred, junior stock means any class or series of stock of the Company that ranks junior to the Preferred either as to the payment of dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company s junior stock includes the Company s common stock. 
 -55- 

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of parity stock, as defined below, having Dividend Payment Dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates pertaining to the Preferred, on a Dividend Payment Date falling within the related Dividend Period for the Preferred) in full upon the Preferred and any shares of parity stock, all dividends declared upon the Preferred and all such equally ranking securities payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period for the Preferred) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Preferred and all parity stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Preferred, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period for the Preferred) bear to each other. 
 As used in this description of the Preferred, parity stock means any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks equally with the Preferred in the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Company s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) may be declared and paid on the Company s common stock and any other stock ranking equally with or junior to the Preferred from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the shares of the Preferred shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 Redemption 
 The Preferred may be redeemed (but subject to applicable regulatory limits) in whole or in part, at the Company s option. Any such redemption will be at a cash redemption price of 100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends including, without regard to any undeclared dividends. Holders of Preferred have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Preferred. If notice of redemption of any Preferred has been given and if the funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of the Preferred so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, those shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares (including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. 
 If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of shares of the Preferred in proportion to the number of shares held by those holders or by lot or in such other manner as the Company s board of directors or a committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable. 
 The Company will mail notice of every redemption of Preferred by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the Preferred to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the Company s books. This mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption provided that if the Preferred is held in book-entry form through DTC, the Company may give this notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Any notice mailed or otherwise given as provided in this paragraph will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives this notice, and failure duly to give this notice by mail or otherwise, or any defect in this notice or in the mailing or provision of this notice, to any holder of Preferred designated for redemption will not affect the redemption of any other Preferred. If the Company redeems the Preferred, the Trust, as holder of the Preferred, will redeem the corresponding APEX as described under Mandatory Redemption of APEX upon Redemption of Preferred. 
 Each notice shall state 
 the redemption date 
 the number of shares of the Preferred to be redeemed and, if less than all shares of the Preferred held by the holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from the holder 
 the redemption price and 
 the place or places where the Preferred is to be redeemed. 
 The Company s right to redeem the Preferred once issued is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor banking agency). 
 -56- 

Liquidation Rights 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Preferred are entitled to receive out of assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, if any, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of the Company s other shares of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of the Preferred, a liquidating distribution in the amount of 100,000 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Preferred are not entitled to any other amounts from the Company after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 In any such distribution, if the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Preferred and all holders of any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to such distribution with the Preferred, the amounts paid to the holders of the Preferred and to the holders of all such other stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution, including any declared but unpaid dividends (and any unpaid, accrued cumulative dividends in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of Preferred and any other shares of the Company s stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the holders of the Company s other stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 For purposes of this description of the Preferred, the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Preferred receive cash, securities or property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company for cash, securities or other property shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as provided below, the holders of the Preferred have no voting rights. 
 Whenever dividends on any shares of the Preferred shall have not been declared and paid for a period the equivalent of six or more dividend payments, whether or not consecutive, equivalent to at least 18 months Dividend Periods (as used in this section, a Nonpayment ), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock (as defined below) then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of the Company s board of directors (as used in this section, the Preferred Stock Directors ), provided that the election of any such director shall not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Company s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and provided further that the Company s board of directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Company s board of directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Preferred or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Preferred and any such series of voting preferred stock for at least one year four Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, following the Nonpayment shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for payment). 
 As used in this description of the Preferred, voting preferred stock means any other class or series of preferred stock of the Company ranking equally with the Preferred either as to dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of the Preferred and any other voting preferred stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 If and when dividends for at least four Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, following a Nonpayment have been paid in full (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside), the holders of the Preferred shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and, if such voting rights for all other holders of voting preferred stock have terminated, the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four Dividend Periods, whether or not consecutive, the Company may take account of any dividend the Company elects to pay for a Dividend Period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class with all series 
 -57- 

of voting preferred stock then outstanding). So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Preferred and all voting preferred stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 So long as any shares of the Preferred remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Preferred and all other series of voting preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting 
 authorized amount of, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Preferred with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company 
 amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Company s restated certificate of incorporation so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Preferred, taken as a whole or 
 consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Preferred or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, unless in each case (i) the shares of the Preferred remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Preferred, taken as a whole 
 provided , however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Preferred or other authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and or junior to the Preferred with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would adversely affect one or more but not all series of voting preferred stock (including the Preferred for this purpose), then only the series affected and entitled to vote shall vote as a class in lieu of all such series of preferred stock. 
 Without the consent of the holders of the Preferred, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Preferred, the Company may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Preferred 
 to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in the certificate of designations for the Preferred that may be defective or inconsistent or 
 to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Preferred that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the certificate of designations. 
 The foregoing voting provisions do not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of the Preferred shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of the Preferred to effect such redemption. 
 Form 
 The Preferred are issued only in fully registered form. Other than the fractional shares currently held by each Trust, no fractional shares will be issued unless a Trust is dissolved and the Company delivers the shares, rather than depositary receipts representing the shares, to the registered holders of its APEX. If a Trust is dissolved and depositary receipts or shares of the Preferred held by the Trust are distributed to holders of its APEX, the Company would intend to distribute them in book-entry form only and the procedures governing holding and transferring beneficial interests in the Preferred, and the circumstances in which holders of beneficial interests will 
 -58- 

be entitled to receive certificates evidencing their shares or depositary receipts. If the Company determines to issue depositary shares representing fractional interests in the Preferred, each depositary share will be represented by a depositary receipt. In such an event, the Preferred represented by the depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement among the Company, a depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts representing depositary shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of any deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of the Preferred represented by such depositary share, to all the rights applicable fraction of a share of the Preferred represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Preferred represented thereby (including dividends, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Title 
 The Company, the transfer agent and registrar for the Preferred held by a Trust, and any of their agents may treat the registered owner of the Preferred, which shall be the Property Trustee unless and until the Trust is dissolved, as the absolute owner of that stock, whether or not any payment for the Preferred shall be overdue and despite any notice to the contrary, for any purpose. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 If a Trust is dissolved and shares of the Preferred held by the Trust or depositary receipts representing the Preferred are distributed to holders of APEX, the Company may appoint a transfer agent, registrar, calculation agent, redemption agent and dividend disbursement agent for the Preferred. The registrar for the Preferred will send notices to shareholders of any meetings at which holders of the Preferred have the right to vote on any matter.

DESCRIPTION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES F, CALLABLE FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2031 OF GS FINANCE CORP. (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the Callable Fixed and Floating Rate Notes, an issuance of Medium-Term Notes, Series F of GS Finance Corp. GSFC (the Callable Notes ), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. It does not purport to be complete. This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2008, among GSFC, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2015, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 21, 2018 and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 (collectively, the GSFC 2008 Indenture ), which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The GSFC 2008 indenture permits GSFC to issue, from time to time, different series of debt securities and, within each different series of debt securities, different debt securities. The Medium-Term Notes, Series F are a single, distinct series of debt securities. GSFC may, however, issue notes in such amounts, at such times and on such terms as GSFC wishes. The notes of the Medium-Term Notes, Series F may differ from one another, and from other series, in their terms. 
 In this description, references to a series of debt securities mean a series issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as the notes issued under GSFC s Medium-Term Notes, Series F program. 
 Terms of the Callable Notes 
 The Callable Notes were originally issued on March 11, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of March 11, 2031 (the stated maturity date ). As noted above, the Callable Notes are part of a series of debt securities, entitled Medium-Term Notes, Series F, that GSFC may issue under the GSFC 2008 Indenture from time to time. The Callable Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Bonds Market under the ticker symbol GS 31B. 
 The payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Callable Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the Callable Notes has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by GSFC or by the Company. The guarantee of senior debt securities of GSFC, such as the Callable Notes, will rank equally in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of the Company. 
 
 Payment of Principal on Stated Maturity Date 
 GSFC will pay holders of Callable Notes that have not been redeemed by the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to the outstanding face amount of such holders Callable Notes. The stated maturity date of the Callable Notes is March 11, 2031, subject to GSFC s early redemption right. If the stated maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of principal otherwise due on such day will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated maturity date. 
 
 Interest Payments 
 For each fixed rate interest period, the fixed interest rate on the Callable Notes will equal 5 per annum. For each floating rate interest period, the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes will be based upon the CMS spread on the relevant interest determination date for such floating rate interest period and will be a rate per annum equal to 
 if (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25 times (ii) 6.5 is greater than or equal to the maximum interest rate, the maximum interest rate 
 if (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25 times (ii) 6.5 is less than the maximum interest rate but greater than the minimum interest rate, (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25 times (ii) 6.5 or 
 if (i) the CMS spread minus 0.25 times (ii) 6.5 is equal to or less than the minimum interest rate, the minimum interest rate. 
 The maximum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 10 per annum. Based on the formula used to calculate the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes, holders will not benefit from any increases in the CMS spread minus 0.25 above approximately 1.54 . The minimum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 0 per annum. 
 -60- 

The term fixed rate interest periods means the periods from and including a fixed rate interest payment date (or the original issue date, in the case of the first fixed rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding fixed rate interest payment date, where the term fixed rate interest payment dates means March 11, June 11, September 11 and December 11 of each year, commencing on June 11, 2021 and ending on March 11, 2022, subject to adjustments as described below. 
 The term floating rate interest periods means the periods from and including a floating rate interest payment date (or the final fixed rate interest payment date, in the case of the first floating rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding floating rate interest payment date (or the stated maturity date, in the case of the final floating rate interest period), where the term floating rate interest payment dates means March 11, June 11, September 11 and December 11 of each year, beginning on June 11, 2022 and ending on the stated maturity date, subject to adjustments as described below. 
 The term interest determination dates means, for each floating rate interest period, the second U.S. Government securities business day preceding such floating rate interest period. 
 The term CMS spread means, on any interest determination date, the 30-year CMS rate minus the 5-year CMS rate, as described under CMS Rate below. 
 The calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest payable on each fixed rate interest payment date and floating rate interest payment date (each, an interest payment date for the applicable fixed rate interest period and floating rate interest period (each, an interest period in the following manner. For each 1,000 face amount of the Callable Notes and for each interest period, the calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest to be paid by calculating the product of (i) the 1,000 face amount times (ii) the applicable fixed interest rate or floating interest rate times (iii) the applicable day count convention on a 30 360 (ISDA) basis. 
 Interest will be paid on the Callable Notes on each quarterly interest payment date. If an interest payment date (other than the interest payment date that falls on the stated maturity date) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment due on such interest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day provided that interest due with respect to such interest payment date shall not accrue from and including such interest payment date to and including the date of payment of such interest as so postponed. If the stated maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of interest otherwise due on such day will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated maturity date. 
 CMS Rate 
 References to the 30-year CMS rate or the 5-year CMS rate on an interest determination date mean the rate appearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for 30-year or 5-year index maturity, as the case may be, as of approximately 11 00 A.M., New York City time, on such interest determination date. If a CMS rate cannot be determined in this manner on the relevant interest determination date, the following procedures will apply to the Callable Notes. 
 If the calculation agent determines on an interest determination date that a CMS rate has been discontinued, then the calculation agent will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined in its sole discretion is most comparable to the applicable CMS rate, provided that if the calculation agent determines there is an industry-accepted successor rate, then the calculation agent shall use such successor rate. If the calculation agent has determined a substitute or successor rate in accordance with the foregoing, the calculation agent in its sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the applicable business days and the interest determination dates to be used, and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or successor rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable to the applicable CMS rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor rate. 
 Unless the calculation agent uses a substitute or successor rate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be determined in the manner described above, the applicable CMS rate for that interest determination date will be determined by the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to the foregoing display page, or any other source it deems reasonable, in its sole discretion. 
 The applicable CMS rate will be subject to the corrections, if any, published on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 within one hour of the time that rate was first displayed on such source. 
 The term Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 means the display on the Refinitiv Eikon service, or any successor or replacement service, on the page ICESWAP1, or any successor or replacement page on that service.

Manner of Payment 
 Any payment on the Callable Notes at maturity or upon redemption will be made to an account designated by the holder of such Callable Notes and approved by GSFC, or at the office of the trustee in New York City, but only when such Callable Notes are surrendered to the trustee at that office. GSFC may pay interest on any interest payment date by check mailed to the person who is the holder on the regular record date. GSCF also may make any payment in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary. 
 Modified Business Day 
 Any payment on the Callable Notes that would otherwise be due on a day that is not a business day may instead be paid on the next day that is a business day, with the same effect as if paid on the original due date. For the Callable Notes, however, the term business day may have a different meaning than it does for other Series F medium-term notes, as described under Special Calculation Provisions below. 
 Role of Calculation Agent 
 The calculation agent in its sole discretion will make all determinations regarding the CMS spread, the 30-year CMS rate, the 5-year CMS rate, the interest determination dates, the regular record dates, the interest payable on each interest payment date, U.S. Government securities business days, business days, postponement of the stated maturity date and the amount payable on the Callable Notes at maturity or redemption, as applicable. Absent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding on holders of the Callable Notes and GSFC, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. 
 Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC GS&Co. ), an affiliate of GSFC, is currently serving as the calculation agent as of the date of this description. GSFC may change the calculation agent for the Callable Notes at any time after the date of this prospectus supplement without notice and GS&Co. may resign as calculation agent at any time upon 60 days written notice to GSFC. 
 Early Redemption Right 
 GSFC may redeem the Callable Notes, at GSFC s option, in whole but not in part, on the interest payment date falling on March 11, 2022 and on each interest payment date occurring thereafter, for an amount equal to 100 of the face amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 If GSFC chooses to exercise its early redemption right, it will notify the holder of the Callable Notes and the trustee by giving at least five business days prior notice. The day GSFC gives the notice, which will be a business day, will be the redemption notice date and the immediately following interest payment date, which GSFC will state in the redemption notice, will be the redemption date. GSFC will not give a redemption notice that results in a redemption date later than the stated maturity date. 
 If GSFC gives the holder a redemption notice, GSFC will redeem the entire outstanding face amount of such holder s Callable Notes. On the redemption date, GSFC will pay to the holder of record on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date, the redemption price in cash, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, in the manner described under Manner of Payment above. 
 Special Calculation Provisions 
 The term business day with respect to the Callable Notes means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. 
 References to a U.S. Government securities business day with respect to the Callable Notes mean any day except for a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends that the fixed income department of its members be closed for the entire day for purposes of trading in U.S. government securities. 
 Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 The provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance in the GSFC 2008 Indenture do not apply to the Callable Notes. 
 -62- 

Default, Remedies and Waiver of Default 
 A holder will have special rights if an event of default with respect to his or her series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, as described in this subsection. 
 Events of Default 
 References to an event of default with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following 
 GSFC or the Company does not pay the principal or any premium on any debt security of that series within 30 days after the due date 
 GSFC or the Company does not pay interest on any debt security of that series within 30 days after the due date or 
 GSFC files for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to GSFC occur. Those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law, unless GSFC merges, consolidates or sells its assets as described above and the successor firm is a non-U.S. entity. If that happens, then those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law or the law of the jurisdiction in which the successor firm is legally organized. 
 As described below under Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company will not cause any of GSFC s debt securities issued under such indenture to be automatically accelerated. In the event that the Company becomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (but GSFC does not), any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will not be immediately due and repayable. In addition, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company (including, for example, a breach of the Company s covenants and warranties with respect to mergers and similar transactions or restrictions on liens) will not have the potential to cause any of GSFC s debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture to be declared due and payable immediately. Instead, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the trustee or holder will need to wait until the earlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself becomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities, (ii) the Company otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities and (iii) the final maturity of the debt securities. The return the holder receives on any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture may be significantly less than what a holder would have otherwise received had the debt securities been automatically accelerated upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company or declared due and payable immediately following the breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company. 
 Covenant Breaches 
 References to a covenant breach with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following 
 GSFC or the Company does not deposit a required sinking fund payment with regard to any debt security of that series on the due date 
 GSFC remains in breach of any other covenant it makes in the GSFC 2008 Indenture for the benefit of the relevant series for 60 days after GSFC and the Company receive a notice of default stating that GSFC is in breach and requiring GSFC to remedy the breach. The notice must be sent by the trustee or the holders of at least 10 in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities then outstanding 
 Except as provided by the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the debt security of that series and the related guarantee, the guarantee ceases to be effective, or a court finds the guarantee to be unenforceable or invalid, or the Company denies its obligations as the guarantor. 
 A covenant breach shall not be an event of default with respect to any security. 
 Remedies If an Event of Default or Covenant Breach Occurs 
 If an event of default has occurred with respect to any series of debt securities and has not been cured or waived, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of all debt securities of that series then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series to be due immediately. If the event of default occurs because of events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to GSFC, the 
 -63- 

entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series will be automatically accelerated, without any action by the trustee or any holder. 
 Each of the situations described above is called an acceleration of the stated maturity of the affected series of debt securities. If the stated maturity of any series is accelerated and a judgment for payment has not yet been obtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may cancel the acceleration for the entire series. 
 If an event of default or a covenant breach occurs, the trustee will have special duties. In that situation, the trustee will be obligated to use those of its rights and powers under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or her own affairs. 
 Except as described in the prior paragraph, the trustee is not required to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability i.e ., an indemnity). If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee with respect to that series. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to the debt securities of that series. 
 Before a holder bypasses the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce its rights or protect its interests relating to any debt security, all of the following must occur 
 The holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default or a covenant breach has occurred, and the event of default or covenant breach must not have been cured or waived 
 The holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of all debt securities of a holder s series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and they or other holders must offer to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action 
 The trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after the above steps have been taken and 
 During those 60 days, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder s series must not have given the trustee directions that are inconsistent with the written request of the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder s series. 
 A holder is entitled at any time, however, to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on his or her debt security on or after its stated maturity (or, if the debt security is redeemable, on or after its redemption date). 
 Waiver of Default 
 The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series may waive a default for all debt securities of that series. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it has not occurred. No one can waive a payment default on a holder s debt security, however, without the approval of the particular holder of that debt security. 
 GSFC and the Company Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually 
 GSFC and the Company will furnish to the trustee every year a written statement, respectively, of two of their officers certifying that to their knowledge GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, is in compliance with the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under it, or else specifying any default under the relevant debt indenture. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term default means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an event of default or covenant breach. 
 Default Amount on Acceleration 
 If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated, GSFC will pay the default amount in respect of the principal of the Callable Notes at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the Callable Notes as described earlier. 
 -64- 

For the purpose of determining whether the holders of GSFC s Medium-Term Notes Series F, which include the Callable Notes, are entitled to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, GSFC will treat the outstanding face amount of each Callable Note as the outstanding principal amount of that note. Although the terms of the Callable Notes differ from those of the other Medium-Term Notes Series F, holders of specified percentages in principal amount of all Medium-Term Notes Series F, together in some cases with other series of GSFC s debt securities, will be able to take action affecting all the Medium-Term Notes Series F, including the Callable Notes, except with respect to certain Medium-Term Notes Series F, if the terms of such notes specify that the holders of specified percentages in the principal amount of all such notes must also consent to such action. This action may involve changing some of the terms that apply to the Medium-Term Notes Series F, accelerating the maturity of the Medium-Term Notes Series F, after a default or waiving some of GSFC s obligations under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. In addition, certain changes to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the Callable Notes that only affect certain debt securities may be made with the approval of holders of a majority of the principal amount of such affected debt securities. 
 Guarantee by the Company 
 The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Medium-Term Notes, Series F, which include the Callable Notes, when due and payable, whether at the stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of the security and the GSFC 2008 Indenture. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the debt securities has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by the Company. 
 The guarantee by the Company of its debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will rank equally in right of payment with all senior indebtedness of the Company. 
 Mergers and Similar Transactions 
 GSFC and the Company are generally permitted to merge or consolidate with another corporation or other entity. GSFC and the Company also permitted to sell their assets substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity. With regard to any series of debt securities, however, GSFC or the Company may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met 
 If the successor entity in the transaction is not GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, the successor entity must be organized as a corporation, partnership or trust and must expressly assume the obligations of GSFC or the Company under the debt securities of that series and the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to that series. The successor entity may be organized under the laws of any jurisdiction, whether in the United States or elsewhere. 
 Immediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities of that series or the related guarantees has occurred and is continuing. For this purpose, default under the debt securities of that series or the related guarantees means an event of default or a covenant breach with respect to that series or the related guarantees or any event that would be an event of default with respect to that series or the related guarantees if the requirements for giving GSFC or the Company default notice and for GSFC s or the Company s default having to continue for a specific period of time were disregarded. 
 If the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to debt securities of any series, neither GSFC nor the Company will need to obtain the approval of the holders of those debt securities in order to merge or consolidate or to sell assets of GSFC or the Company. Also, these conditions will apply only if GSFC or the Company wishes to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as an entirety to another entity. Neither GSFC nor the Company will need to satisfy these conditions if GSFC or the Company enters into other types of transactions, including any transaction in which GSFC or the Company acquire the stock or assets of another entity, any transaction that involves a change of control of GSFC or the Company but in which GSFC or the Company does not merge or consolidate and any transaction in which GSFC or the Company sells less than substantially all assets of GSFC or the Company. While GSFC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, there is no requirement that it remain a subsidiary. 
 Also, if GSFC or the Company merges, consolidates or sells assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as an entirety and the successor is a non-U.S. entity, neither GSFC nor any successor would have any obligation to compensate a holder for any resulting adverse tax consequences relating to his or her debt securities. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, GSFC may sell or transfer its assets substantially as an entirety, in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that GSFC s assets and the assets of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not sold 
 -65- 

or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company. may sell or transfer its assets substantially as an entirety in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that the assets of the Company and its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not sold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not such subsidiaries. 
 Restriction on Liens 
 In the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the Company promises, with respect to each series of senior debt securities, not to create, assume, incur or guarantee any debt for borrowed money that is secured by a lien on the voting or profit participating equity ownership interests that the Company or any of its subsidiaries own in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or in any subsidiary of the Company that beneficially owns or holds, directly or indirectly, those interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, unless the Company also secures the senior debt securities of that series on an equal or priority basis with the other secured debt. The promise of the Company, however, is subject to an important exception it may secure debt for borrowed money with liens on those interests without securing the senior debt securities of any series if its board of directors determines that the liens do not materially detract from or interfere with the value or control of those interests, as of the date of the determination. 
 Except as noted above, the GSFC 2008 Indenture does not restrict the Company s ability to put liens on its interests in its subsidiaries other than Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, nor does the indenture restrict the Company s ability to sell or otherwise dispose of its interests in any of its subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. In addition, the restriction on liens in the GSFC 2008 Indenture applies only to liens that secure debt for borrowed money. For example, liens imposed by operation of law, such as liens to secure statutory obligations for taxes or workers compensation benefits, or liens the Company creates to secure obligations to pay legal judgments or surety bonds, would not be covered by this restriction. 
 Modification of the Debt Indenture and Waiver of Covenants 
 There are four types of changes GSFC and the Company can make to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities or series of debt securities and related guarantees issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. 
 Changes Requiring Each Holder s Approval 
 First, there are changes that cannot be made without the approval of the holder of each debt security affected by the change under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. Here is a list of those types of changes 
 change the stated maturity for any principal or interest payment on a debt security 
 reduce the principal amount, the amount payable on acceleration of the stated maturity after a default, the interest rate or the redemption price for a debt security 
 permit redemption of a debt security if not previously permitted 
 impair any right a holder may have to require repayment of its debt security 
 change the currency of any payment on a debt security 
 change the place of payment on a debt security 
 impair a holder s right to sue for payment of any amount due on its debt security 
 reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, taken 
 separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or less than all of the debt securities of a series, the approval of whose holders is needed to change the applicable debt indenture or those debt securities 
 reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, taken separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or less than all of the debt securities of a series, the consent of whose holders is needed to waive GSFC s compliance with the applicable debt indenture or to waive defaults and 
 change the provisions of the applicable debt indenture dealing with modification and waiver in any other respect, except to increase any required percentage referred to above or to add to the provisions that cannot be changed or waived without approval of the holder of each affected debt security. 
 Changes Not Requiring Approval 
 The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the debt securities affected. These changes are limited to clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect any debt securities of any series in any material respect. Neither GSFC nor the Company needs any approval to make changes that affect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable indenture after the changes take effect. 
 -66- 

GSFC and the Company may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect a particular debt security, even if they affect other debt securities. In those cases, neither GSFC nor the Company needs to obtain the approval of the holder of the unaffected debt security GSFC and the Company need only obtain any required approvals from the holders of the affected debt securities. 
 Changes Requiring Majority Approval 
 Any other change to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under such debt indenture would require the following approval 
 If the change affects only particular debt securities within a series, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of such particular debt securities. 
 If the change affects multiple debt securities of one or more series, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities affected by the change, with all such affected debt securities voting together as one class for this purpose (and by the holders of a majority in principal amount of any affected debt securities that by their terms are entitled to vote separately). 
 In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent. 
 This would mean that modification of terms with respect to certain debt securities of a series could be effectuated under the GSFC 2008 Indenture without obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of other securities of such series that are not affected by such modification. 
 The same majority approval would be required for GSFC to obtain a waiver of any of its covenants in the GSFC 2008 Indenture. GSFC s covenants include the promises GSFC and the Company make about merging and, with respect to the Company, putting liens on GSFC s interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, neither GSFC nor the Company will have to comply with it. The holders, however, cannot approve a waiver of any provision in a particular debt security, or in the GSFC 2008 Indenture as it affects that debt security, that neither GSFC nor the Company can change without the approval of the holder of that debt security as described above in Changes Requiring Each Holder s Approval, unless that holder approves the waiver. 
 Special Rules for Action by Holders 
 When holders take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as giving a notice of default, notice of covenant breach, declaring an acceleration, approving any change or waiver or giving the trustee an instruction, GSFC will apply the following rules. 
 Only Outstanding Debt Securities Are Eligible 
 Only holders of outstanding debt securities or the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series, as applicable, will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of such debt securities or the debt securities of that series. Also, GSFC will count only outstanding debt securities in determining whether the various percentage requirements for taking action have been met. For these purposes, a debt security will not be outstanding if 
 it has been surrendered for cancellation 
 GSFC has deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or redemption 
 GSFC has fully defeased it or 
 GSFC or one of its affiliates, such as Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, is the owner. 
 Determining Record Dates for Action by Holders 
 GSFC and the Company will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders that are entitled to take action under a particular debt indenture. In certain limited circumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders. If GSFC, the Company or the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may be taken only by persons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period that GSFC specifies 
 -67- 

for this purpose, or that the trustee specifies if it sets the record date. GSFC, the Company or the trustee, as applicable, may shorten or lengthen this period from time to time. 
 This period, however, may not extend beyond the 180th day after the record date for the action. In addition, record dates for any global debt security may be set in accordance with procedures established by the depositary from time to time. Accordingly, record dates for global debt securities may differ from those for other debt securities. 
 Form of Callable Notes 
 The Callable Notes are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company and represented by a global note. GSFC will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global note except in limited circumstances.

DESCRIPTION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES F, CALLABLE FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE MAY 2031 OF GS FINANCE CORP. (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.) 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the Callable Fixed and Floating Rate Notes, an issuance of Medium-Term Notes, Series F of GS Finance Corp. GSFC (the Callable Notes ), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. It does not purport to be complete. This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of October 10, 2008, among GSFC, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2015, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 21, 2018 and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 (collectively, the GSFC 2008 Indenture ), which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is a part. Unless the context otherwise provides, all references to the Company in this description refer only to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and does not include its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The GSFC 2008 indenture permits GSFC to issue, from time to time, different series of debt securities and, within each different series of debt securities, different debt securities. The Medium-Term Notes, Series F are a single, distinct series of debt securities. GSFC may, however, issue notes in such amounts, at such times and on such terms as GSFC wishes. The notes of the Medium-Term Notes, Series F may differ from one another, and from other series, in their terms. 
 In this description, references to a series of debt securities mean a series issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as the notes issued under GSFC s Medium-Term Notes, Series F program. 
 Terms of the Callable Notes 
 The Callable Notes were originally issued on May 28, 2021 and have a stated maturity date of May 28, 2031 (the stated maturity date ). As noted above, the Callable Notes are part of a series of debt securities, entitled Medium-Term Notes, Series F, that GSFC may issue under the GSFC 2008 Indenture from time to time. The Callable Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange Bonds Market under the ticker symbol GS 31X. 
 The payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Callable Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the Callable Notes has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by GSFC or by the Company. The guarantee of senior debt securities of GSFC, such as the Callable Notes, will rank equally in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of the Company. 
 Payment of Principal on Stated Maturity Date 
 GSFC will pay holders of Callable Notes that have not been redeemed by the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to the outstanding face amount of such holders Callable Notes. The stated maturity date of the Callable Notes is May 28, 2031, subject to GSFC s early redemption right. If the stated maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of principal otherwise due on such day will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated maturity date. 
 Interest Payments 
 For each fixed rate interest period, the fixed interest rate on the Callable Notes will equal 4.25 per annum. For each floating rate interest period, the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes will be based upon the CMS spread on the relevant interest determination date for such floating rate interest period and will be a rate per annum equal to 
 if (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is greater than or equal to the maximum interest rate, the maximum interest rate 
 
 if (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is less than the maximum interest rate but greater than the minimum interest rate, (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 or 
 
 if (i) the CMS spread times (ii) 3.25 is equal to or less than the minimum interest rate, the minimum interest rate. 
 -69- 

The maximum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 8 per annum. Based on the formula used to calculate the floating interest rate on the Callable Notes, holders will not benefit from any increases in the CMS spread above approximately 2.46 . The minimum interest rate on the Callable Notes is 1 per annum. 
 The term fixed rate interest periods means the periods from and including a fixed rate interest payment date (or the original issue date, in the case of the first fixed rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding fixed rate interest payment date, where the term fixed rate interest payment dates means February 28, May 28, August 28 and November 28 of each year, commencing on August 28, 2021 and ending on May 28, 2023, subject to adjustments as described below. 
 The term floating rate interest periods means the periods from and including a floating rate interest payment date (or the final fixed rate interest payment date, in the case of the first floating rate interest period) to but excluding the next succeeding floating rate interest payment date (or the stated maturity date, in the case of the final floating rate interest period), where the term floating rate interest payment dates February 28, May 28, August 28, and November 28 of each year, beginning on May 28, 2023 and ending on the stated maturity date, subject to adjustments as described below. 
 The term interest determination dates means, for each floating rate interest period, the second U.S. Government securities business day preceding such floating rate interest period. 
 The term CMS spread means, on any interest determination date, the 30-year CMS rate minus the 5-year CMS rate, as described under CMS Rate below. 
 The calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest payable on each fixed rate interest payment date and floating rate interest payment date (each, an interest payment date for the applicable fixed rate interest period and floating rate interest period (each, an interest period in the following manner. For each 1,000 face amount of the Callable Notes and for each interest period, the calculation agent will calculate the amount of interest to be paid by calculating the product of (i) the 1,000 face amount times (ii) the applicable fixed interest rate or floating interest rate times (iii) the applicable day count convention on a 30 360 (ISDA) basis. 
 Interest will be paid on the Callable Notes on each quarterly interest payment date. If an interest payment date (other than the interest payment date that falls on the stated maturity date) falls on a day that is not a business day, the payment due on such interest payment date will be postponed to the next day that is a business day provided that interest due with respect to such interest payment date shall not accrue from and including such interest payment date to and including the date of payment of such interest as so postponed. If the stated maturity date falls on a day that is not a business day, payment of interest otherwise due on such day will be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the stated maturity date. 
 CMS Rate 
 References to the 30-year CMS rate or the 5-year CMS rate on an interest determination date mean the rate appearing on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 for 30-year or 5-year index maturity, as the case may be, as of approximately 11 00 A.M., New York City time, on such interest determination date. If a CMS rate cannot be determined in this manner on the relevant interest determination date, the following procedures will apply to the Callable Notes. 
 If the calculation agent determines on an interest determination date that a CMS rate has been discontinued, then the calculation agent will use a substitute or successor rate that it has determined in its sole discretion is most comparable to the applicable CMS rate, provided that if the calculation agent determines there is an industry-accepted successor rate, then the calculation agent shall use such successor rate. If the calculation agent has determined a substitute or successor rate in accordance with the foregoing, the calculation agent in its sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the applicable business days and the interest determination dates to be used, and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or successor rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor rate comparable to the applicable CMS rate, in a manner that is consistent with any industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor rate. 
 Unless the calculation agent uses a substitute or successor rate as so provided, if the CMS rate cannot be determined in the manner described above, the applicable CMS rate for that interest determination date will be determined by the calculation agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to the foregoing display page, or any other source it deems reasonable, in its sole discretion. 
 
 -70- 

The applicable CMS rate will be subject to the corrections, if any, published on the Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 within one hour of the time that rate was first displayed on such source. 
 The term Refinitiv page ICESWAP1 means the display on the Refinitiv Eikon service, or any successor or replacement service, on the page ICESWAP1, or any successor or replacement page on that service. 
 Manner of Payment 
 Any payment on the Callable Notes at maturity or upon redemption will be made to an account designated by the holder of such Callable Notes and approved by GSFC, or at the office of the trustee in New York City, but only when such Callable Notes are surrendered to the trustee at that office. GSFC may pay interest on any interest payment date by check mailed to the person who is the holder on the regular record date. GSCF also may make any payment in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary. 
 Modified Business Day 
 Any payment on the Callable Notes that would otherwise be due on a day that is not a business day may instead be paid on the next day that is a business day, with the same effect as if paid on the original due date. For the Callable Notes, however, the term business day may have a different meaning than it does for other Series F medium-term notes, as described under Special Calculation Provisions below. 
 Role of Calculation Agent 
 The calculation agent in its sole discretion will make all determinations regarding the CMS spread, the 30-year CMS rate, the 5-year CMS rate, the interest determination dates, the regular record dates, the interest payable on each interest payment date, U.S. Government securities business days, business days, postponement of the stated maturity date and the amount payable on the Callable Notes at maturity or redemption, as applicable. Absent manifest error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be final and binding on holders of the Callable Notes and GSFC, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. 
 Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC GS&Co. ), an affiliate of GSFC, is currently serving as the calculation agent as of the date of this description. GSFC may change the calculation agent for the Callable Notes at any time after the date of this prospectus supplement without notice and GS&Co. may resign as calculation agent at any time upon 60 days written notice to GSFC. 
 Early Redemption Right 
 GSFC may redeem the Callable Notes, at GSFC s option, in whole but not in part, on the interest payment date falling on May 28, 2022 and on each interest payment date occurring thereafter, for an amount equal to 100 of the face amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
 If GSFC chooses to exercise its early redemption right, it will notify the holder of the Callable Notes and the trustee by giving at least five business days prior notice. The day GSFC gives the notice, which will be a business day, will be the redemption notice date and the immediately following interest payment date, which GSFC will state in the redemption notice, will be the redemption date. GSFC will not give a redemption notice that results in a redemption date later than the stated maturity date. 
 If GSFC gives the holder a redemption notice, GSFC will redeem the entire outstanding face amount of such holder s Callable Notes. On the redemption date, GSFC will pay to the holder of record on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date, the redemption price in cash, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, in the manner described under Manner of Payment above. 
 Special Calculation Provisions 
 The term business day with respect to the Callable Notes means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. 
 References to a U.S. Government securities business day with respect to the Callable Notes mean any day except for a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends 
 -71- 

that the fixed income department of its members be closed for the entire day for purposes of trading in U.S. government securities. 
 
 Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 The provisions for full defeasance and covenant defeasance in the GSFC 2008 Indenture do not apply to the Callable Notes. 
 Default, Remedies and Waiver of Default 
 A holder will have special rights if an event of default with respect to his or her series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, as described in this subsection. 
 Events of Default 
 References to an event of default with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following 
 GSFC or the Company does not pay the principal or any premium on any debt security of that series within 30 days after the due date 
 
 GSFC or the Company does not pay interest on any debt security of that series within 30 days after the due date or 
 
 GSFC files for bankruptcy or other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to GSFC occur. Those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law, unless GSFC merges, consolidates or sells its assets as described above and the successor firm is a non-U.S. entity. If that happens, then those events must arise under U.S. federal or state law or the law of the jurisdiction in which the successor firm is legally organized. 
 As described below under Remedies If an Event of Default Occurs, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company will not cause any of GSFC s debt securities issued under such indenture to be automatically accelerated. In the event that the Company becomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (but GSFC does not), any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will not be immediately due and repayable. In addition, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, a breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company (including, for example, a breach of the Company s covenants and warranties with respect to mergers and similar transactions or restrictions on liens) will not have the potential to cause any of GSFC s debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture to be declared due and payable immediately. Instead, under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the trustee or holder will need to wait until the earlier of the time that (i) GSFC itself becomes subject to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities, (ii) the Company otherwise defaults on the terms of the debt securities and (iii) the final maturity of the debt securities. The return the holder receives on any series of debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture may be significantly less than what a holder would have otherwise received had the debt securities been automatically accelerated upon certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to the Company or declared due and payable immediately following the breach of a covenant or warranty by the Company. 
 Covenant Breaches 
 References to a covenant breach with respect to any series of debt securities mean any of the following 
 GSFC or the Company does not deposit a required sinking fund payment with regard to any debt security of that series on the due date 
 GSFC remains in breach of any other covenant it makes in the GSFC 2008 Indenture for the benefit of the relevant series for 60 days after GSFC and the Company receive a notice of default stating that GSFC is in breach and requiring GSFC to remedy the breach. The notice must be sent by the trustee or the holders of at least 10 in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities then outstanding 
 Except as provided by the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the debt security of that series and the related guarantee, the guarantee ceases to be effective, or a court finds the guarantee to be unenforceable or invalid, or the Company denies its obligations as the guarantor. 
 A covenant breach shall not be an event of default with respect to any security. 
 Remedies If an Event of Default or Covenant Breach Occurs 
 -72- 

If an event of default has occurred with respect to any series of debt securities and has not been cured or waived, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of all debt securities of that series then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series to be due immediately. If the event of default occurs because of events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to GSFC, the entire principal amount of the debt securities of that series will be automatically accelerated, without any action by the trustee or any holder. 
 Each of the situations described above is called an acceleration of the stated maturity of the affected series of debt securities. If the stated maturity of any series is accelerated and a judgment for payment has not yet been obtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may cancel the acceleration for the entire series. 
 If an event of default or a covenant breach occurs, the trustee will have special duties. In that situation, the trustee will be obligated to use those of its rights and powers under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or her own affairs. 
 Except as described in the prior paragraph, the trustee is not required to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability i.e ., an indemnity). If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee with respect to that series. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to the debt securities of that series. 
 Before a holder bypasses the trustee and bring its own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce its rights or protect its interests relating to any debt security, all of the following must occur 
 The holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default or a covenant breach has occurred, and the event of default or covenant breach must not have been cured or waived 
 
 The holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of all debt securities of a holder s series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and they or other holders must offer to the trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action 
 
 The trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after the above steps have been taken and 
 
 During those 60 days, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder s series must not have given the trustee directions that are inconsistent with the written request of the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the debt securities of a holder s series. 
 A holder is entitled at any time, however, to bring a lawsuit for the payment of money due on his or her debt security on or after its stated maturity (or, if the debt security is redeemable, on or after its redemption date). 
 Waiver of Default 
 The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of any series may waive a default for all debt securities of that series. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it has not occurred. No one can waive a payment default on a holder s debt security, however, without the approval of the particular holder of that debt security. 
 
 GSFC and the Company Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually 
 GSFC and the Company will furnish to the trustee every year a written statement, respectively, of two of their officers certifying that to their knowledge GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, is in compliance with the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under it, or else specifying any default under the relevant debt indenture. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term default means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an event of default or covenant breach. 

-73- 

Default Amount on Acceleration 
 If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the Callable Notes is accelerated, GSFC will pay the default amount in respect of the principal of the Callable Notes at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the Callable Notes as described earlier. 
 For the purpose of determining whether the holders of GSFC s Medium-Term Notes Series F, which include the Callable Notes, are entitled to take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, GSFC will treat the outstanding face amount of each Callable Note as the outstanding principal amount of that note. Although the terms of the Callable Notes differ from those of the other Medium-Term Notes Series F, holders of specified percentages in principal amount of all Medium-Term Notes Series F, together in some cases with other series of GSFC s debt securities, will be able to take action affecting all the Medium-Term Notes Series F, including the Callable Notes, except with respect to certain Medium-Term Notes Series F, if the terms of such notes specify that the holders of specified percentages in the principal amount of all such notes must also consent to such action. This action may involve changing some of the terms that apply to the Medium-Term Notes Series F, accelerating the maturity of the Medium-Term Notes Series F, after a default or waiving some of GSFC s obligations under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. In addition, certain changes to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the Callable Notes that only affect certain debt securities may be made with the approval of holders of a majority of the principal amount of such affected debt securities. 
 Guarantee by the Company 
 The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal of, and any interest and premium on, the Medium-Term Notes, Series F, which include the Callable Notes, when due and payable, whether at the stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of the security and the GSFC 2008 Indenture. The guarantee will remain in effect until the entire principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, the debt securities has been paid in full or discharged in accordance with the provisions of the GSFC 2008 Indenture, or otherwise fully defeased by the Company. 
 The guarantee by the Company of its debt securities issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture will rank equally in right of payment with all senior indebtedness of the Company. 
 Mergers and Similar Transactions 
 GSFC and the Company are generally permitted to merge or consolidate with another corporation or other entity. GSFC and the Company also permitted to sell their assets substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity. With regard to any series of debt securities, however, GSFC or the Company may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met 
 If the successor entity in the transaction is not GSFC or the Company, as the case may be, the successor entity must be organized as a corporation, partnership or trust and must expressly assume the obligations of GSFC or the Company under the debt securities of that series and the GSFC 2008 Indenture with respect to that series. The successor entity may be organized under the laws of any jurisdiction, whether in the United States or elsewhere. 
 
 Immediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities of that series or the related guarantees has occurred and is continuing. For this purpose, default under the debt securities of that series or the related guarantees means an event of default or a covenant breach with respect to that series or the related guarantees or any event that would be an event of default with respect to that series or the related guarantees if the requirements for giving GSFC or the Company default notice and for GSFC s or the Company s default having to continue for a specific period of time were disregarded. 
 
 If the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to debt securities of any series, neither GSFC nor the Company will need to obtain the approval of the holders of those debt securities in order to merge or consolidate or to sell assets of GSFC or the Company. Also, these conditions will apply only if GSFC or the Company wishes to merge or consolidate with another entity or sell assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as an entirety to another entity. Neither GSFC nor the Company will need to satisfy these conditions if GSFC or the Company enters into other types of transactions, including any transaction in which GSFC or the Company acquire the stock or assets of another entity, any transaction that involves a change of control of GSFC or the Company but in which GSFC or the Company does not merge or consolidate and any transaction in which GSFC or the Company sells less than substantially all assets of GSFC or the Company. While GSFC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, there is no requirement that it remain a subsidiary. 
 -74- 

Also, if GSFC or the Company merges, consolidates or sells assets of GSFC or the Company substantially as an entirety and the successor is a non-U.S. entity, neither GSFC nor any successor would have any obligation to compensate a holder for any resulting adverse tax consequences relating to his or her debt securities. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, GSFC may sell or transfer its assets substantially as an entirety, in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that GSFC s assets and the assets of its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not sold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company. may sell or transfer its assets substantially as an entirety in one or more transactions, to one or more entities, provided that the assets of the Company and its direct or indirect subsidiaries in which it owns a majority of the combined voting power, taken together, are not sold or transferred substantially as an entirety to one or more entities that are not such subsidiaries. 
 Restriction on Liens 
 In the GSFC 2008 Indenture, the Company promises, with respect to each series of senior debt securities, not to create, assume, incur or guarantee any debt for borrowed money that is secured by a lien on the voting or profit participating equity ownership interests that the Company or any of its subsidiaries own in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, or in any subsidiary of the Company that beneficially owns or holds, directly or indirectly, those interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, unless the Company also secures the senior debt securities of that series on an equal or priority basis with the other secured debt. The promise of the Company, however, is subject to an important exception it may secure debt for borrowed money with liens on those interests without securing the senior debt securities of any series if its board of directors determines that the liens do not materially detract from or interfere with the value or control of those interests, as of the date of the determination. 
 Except as noted above, the GSFC 2008 Indenture does not restrict the Company s ability to put liens on its interests in its subsidiaries other than Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, nor does the indenture restrict the Company s ability to sell or otherwise dispose of its interests in any of its subsidiaries, including Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. In addition, the restriction on liens in the GSFC 2008 Indenture applies only to liens that secure debt for borrowed money. For example, liens imposed by operation of law, such as liens to secure statutory obligations for taxes or workers compensation benefits, or liens the Company creates to secure obligations to pay legal judgments or surety bonds, would not be covered by this restriction. 
 Modification of the Debt Indenture and Waiver of Covenants 
 There are four types of changes GSFC and the Company can make to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities or series of debt securities and related guarantees issued under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. 
 Changes Requiring Each Holder s Approval 
 First, there are changes that cannot be made without the approval of the holder of each debt security affected by the change under the GSFC 2008 Indenture. Here is a list of those types of changes 
 change the stated maturity for any principal or interest payment on a debt security 
 reduce the principal amount, the amount payable on acceleration of the stated maturity after a default, the interest rate or the redemption price for a debt security 
 permit redemption of a debt security if not previously permitted 
 impair any right a holder may have to require repayment of its debt security 
 change the currency of any payment on a debt security 
 change the place of payment on a debt security 
 impair a holder s right to sue for payment of any amount due on its debt security 
 reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, taken 
 separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or less than all of the debt securities of a series, the approval of whose holders is needed to change the applicable debt indenture or those debt securities 
 reduce the percentage in principal amount of the debt securities of any one or more affected series, taken separately or together, as applicable, and whether comprising the same or different series or less than all of the debt securities of a series, the consent of whose holders is needed to waive GSFC s compliance with the applicable debt indenture or to waive defaults and 
 change the provisions of the applicable debt indenture dealing with modification and waiver in any other respect, except to increase any required percentage referred to above or to add to the provisions that cannot be changed or waived without approval of the holder of each affected debt security. 
 Changes Not Requiring Approval 
 -75- 

The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the debt securities affected. These changes are limited to clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect any debt securities of any series in any material respect. Neither GSFC nor the Company needs any approval to make changes that affect only debt securities to be issued under the applicable indenture after the changes take effect. 
 GSFC and the Company may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect a particular debt security, even if they affect other debt securities. In those cases, neither GSFC nor the Company needs to obtain the approval of the holder of the unaffected debt security GSFC and the Company need only obtain any required approvals from the holders of the affected debt securities. 
 Changes Requiring Majority Approval 
 Any other change to the GSFC 2008 Indenture and the debt securities issued under such debt indenture would require the following approval 
 If the change affects only particular debt securities within a series, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of such particular debt securities. 
 
 If the change affects multiple debt securities of one or more series, it must be approved by the holders of a majority in principal amount of all debt securities affected by the change, with all such affected debt securities voting together as one class for this purpose (and by the holders of a majority in principal amount of any affected debt securities that by their terms are entitled to vote separately). 
 In each case, the required approval must be given by written consent. 
 This would mean that modification of terms with respect to certain debt securities of a series could be effectuated under the GSFC 2008 Indenture without obtaining the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of other securities of such series that are not affected by such modification. 
 
 The same majority approval would be required for GSFC to obtain a waiver of any of its covenants in the GSFC 2008 Indenture. GSFC s covenants include the promises GSFC and the Company make about merging and, with respect to the Company, putting liens on GSFC s interests in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, neither GSFC nor the Company will have to comply with it. The holders, however, cannot approve a waiver of any provision in a particular debt security, or in the GSFC 2008 Indenture as it affects that debt security, that neither GSFC nor the Company can change without the approval of the holder of that debt security as described above in Changes Requiring Each Holder s Approval, unless that holder approves the waiver. 
 Special Rules for Action by Holders 
 When holders take any action under the GSFC 2008 Indenture, such as giving a notice of default, notice of covenant breach, declaring an acceleration, approving any change or waiver or giving the trustee an instruction, GSFC will apply the following rules. 
 Only Outstanding Debt Securities Are Eligible 
 Only holders of outstanding debt securities or the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series, as applicable, will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of such debt securities or the debt securities of that series. Also, GSFC will count only outstanding debt securities in determining whether the various percentage requirements for taking action have been met. For these purposes, a debt security will not be outstanding if 
 it has been surrendered for cancellation 
 
 GSFC has deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or redemption 
 
 GSFC has fully defeased it or 
 
 GSFC or one of its affiliates, such as Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, is the owner. 
 -76- 

Determining Record Dates for Action by Holders 
 GSFC and the Company will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders that are entitled to take action under a particular debt indenture. In certain limited circumstances, only the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders. If GSFC, the Company or the trustee set a record date for an approval or other action to be taken by holders, that vote or action may be taken only by persons or entities who are holders on the record date and must be taken during the period that GSFC specifies for this purpose, or that the trustee specifies if it sets the record date. GSFC, the Company or the trustee, as applicable, may shorten or lengthen this period from time to time. 
 This period, however, may not extend beyond the 180th day after the record date for the action. In addition, record dates for any global debt security may be set in accordance with procedures established by the depositary from time to time. Accordingly, record dates for global debt securities may differ from those for other debt securities. 
 Form of Callable Notes 
 The Callable Notes are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company and represented by a global note. GSFC will not issue definitive notes in exchange for the global note except in limited circumstances.

The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within such 30-Business-Day period on which to remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Shares at Risk with the same Transferability Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award.

You should read carefully this entire Award Agreement, which includes the Award Statement, any attached Appendix and the signature card. 
 Acceptance 
 1. You Must Decide Whether to Accept this Award Agreement . To be eligible to receive your Award, you must by the date specified (a) open and activate an Account and (b) agree to all the terms of your Award by executing the related signature card in accordance with its instructions. By executing the signature card, you confirm your agreement to all of the terms of this Award Agreement, including the arbitration and choice of forum provisions in Paragraph 14. 
 Documents that Govern Your Award Definitions 
 2. The Plan . Your Award is granted under the Plan, and the Plan s terms apply to, and are a part of, this Award Agreement.

 4. Definitions . Unless otherwise defined herein, including in the Definitions Appendix or any other Appendix, capitalized terms have the meanings provided in the Plan. 
 Vesting of Your RSUs 
 5. Vesting . All of your Short-Term RSUs are Vested. When an RSU is Vested, it means only that your continued active Employment is not required for delivery of that portion of RSU Shares. Vesting does not mean you have a non-forfeitable right to the Vested portion of your Award. The terms of this Award Agreement (including conditions to delivery) continue to apply to Vested Short-Term RSUs, and you can still forfeit Vested Short-Term RSUs and any RSU Shares . 
 Delivery of Your RSU Shares 
 6. Delivery . Reasonably promptly (but no more than 30 Business Days) after each Delivery Date listed on your Award Statement, RSU Shares (less applicable withholding as described in Paragraph 11(a)) will be delivered (by book entry credit to your Account) in respect of the amount of Outstanding Short-Term RSUs listed next to that date. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within the 30-Business-Day period following the Delivery Date to deliver RSU Shares in respect of all or a portion of the Short-Term RSUs with the same Delivery Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Delivery Date for purposes of this Award. Until such delivery, you have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor, and no rights as a shareholder of GS Inc. Without limiting the Committee s authority under Section 1.3.2(h) of the Plan, the Firm may accelerate any Delivery Date by up to 30 days. 
 Dividends 
 7. Dividend Equivalent Rights and Dividends . Each Short-Term RSU includes a Dividend Equivalent Right, which entitles you to receive an amount (less applicable withholding), at or after the time of distribution of any regular cash dividend paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock, equal to any regular cash dividend payment that would have been made in respect of an RSU Share underlying your Outstanding Short-Term RSUs for any record date that occurs on or after the Date of Grant. 

Forfeiture of Your Award 
 8. How You May Forfeit Your Award . This Paragraph 8 sets forth the events that result in forfeiture of up to all of your Short-Term RSUs and may require repayment to the Firm of up to all other amounts previously delivered or paid to you under your Award in accordance with Paragraph 9.

In addition, the Firm reserves the right to (a) suspend payments under Dividend Equivalent Rights or delivery of RSU Shares, (b) deliver any RSU Shares, dividends or payments under Dividend Equivalent Rights into an escrow account in accordance with Paragraph 11(f)(v) or (c) apply Transfer Restrictions to any RSU Shares in connection with any investigation of whether any of the events that result in forfeiture under the Plan or this Paragraph 8 have occurred. Paragraph 10 (relating to certain circumstances under which delivery may be accelerated) provides for exceptions to one or more provisions of this Paragraph 8.

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 11(b) and Section 1.3.2(i) of the Plan, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any securities, other Awards or other property that the Firm may deliver in respect of your Short-Term RSUs will not have the effect of deferring delivery or payment, income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture, beyond the date on which such delivery, payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with respect to the RSU Shares that would otherwise have been deliverable (unless the Committee elects a later date for this purpose pursuant to Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(D) or otherwise as may be permitted under Section 409A, including and to the extent applicable, the subsequent election provisions of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code and Reg. 1.409A-2(b)). 
 (d) Notwithstanding the timing provisions of Paragraph 10(c), the delivery of RSU Shares referred to therein will be made after the date of death and during the calendar year that includes the date of death (or on such later date as may be permitted under Section 409A). 
 (e) The timing of delivery or payment pursuant to Paragraph 10(a) will occur on the earlier of (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the termination of Employment occurs provided , however , that, if you are a specified employee (as defined by the Firm in accordance with Section 409A(a)(2)(i)(B) of the Code), delivery will occur on the earlier of the Delivery Date or (to the extent required to avoid the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A) the date that is six months after your termination of Employment (or, if the latter date is not during a Window Period, the first trading day of the next Window Period). For purposes of Paragraph 10(a), references in this Award Agreement to termination of Employment mean a termination of Employment from the Firm (as defined by the Firm) which is also a separation from service (as defined by the Firm in accordance with Section 409A). 
 - 7 - 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of Paragraph 7 or Section 2.8.2 of the Plan to the contrary, the Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to each of your Outstanding Short-Term RSUs will be paid to you within the calendar year that includes the date of distribution of any corresponding regular cash dividends paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock the record date for which occurs on or after the Date of Grant. The payment will be in an amount (less applicable withholding) equal to such regular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the RSU Shares underlying such Outstanding Short-Term RSUs. 
 (g) The timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 10(b)(i) will be the earlier of (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the Committee receives satisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment, provided that such delivery or payment will be made, and any Committee action referred to in Paragraph 10(b)(ii) will be taken, only at such time as, and if and to the extent that it, as reasonably determined by the Firm, would not result in the imposition of any additional tax to you under Section 409A. 
 (h) Paragraph 13 and Section 3.4 of the Plan will not apply to Awards that are 409A Deferred Compensation except to the extent permitted under Section 409A. 
 (i) Delivery of RSU Shares in respect of any Award may be made, if and to the extent elected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified hereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the extent that the later delivery is permitted under Section 409A). 
 (j) You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties due pursuant to Section 409A, but in no event will you be permitted to designate, directly or indirectly, the taxable year of the delivery.

 Exhibit 10.46 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Fixed Allowance RSU Award 
 This Award Agreement, together with The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (the Plan ), governs your Fixed Allowance award of RSUs (your Award ). You should read carefully this entire Award Agreement, which includes the Award Statement, any attached Appendix and the signature card. 
 Acceptance 
 1. You Must Decide Whether to Accept this Award Agreement . To be eligible to receive your Award, you must by the date specified (a) open and activate an Account and (b) agree to all the terms of your Award by executing the related signature card in accordance with its instructions. By executing the signature card, you confirm your agreement to all of the terms of this Award Agreement, including the arbitration and choice of forum provisions in Paragraph 13. 
 Documents that Govern Your Award Definitions 
 2. The Plan . Your Award is granted under the Plan, and the Plan s terms apply to, and are a part of, this Award Agreement. 
 3. Your Award Statement . The Award Statement delivered to you contains some of your Award s specific terms. For example, it contains the number of Fixed Allowance RSUs awarded to you and any applicable Delivery Dates and Transferability Dates. 
 4. Definitions . Unless otherwise defined herein, including in the Definitions Appendix or any other Appendix, capitalized terms have the meanings provided in the Plan. 
 Vesting of Your Fixed Allowance RSUs 
 5. Vesting . All of your Fixed Allowance RSUs are Vested. When a Fixed Allowance RSU is Vested, it means that your continued active Employment is not required for delivery of that portion of RSU Shares. The terms of this Award Agreement (including conditions to delivery and any applicable Transfer Restrictions) continue to apply to Vested Fixed Allowance RSUs. 
 Delivery of Your RSU Shares 
 6. Delivery . Reasonably promptly (but no more than 30 Business Days) after each Delivery Date listed on your Award Statement, RSU Shares (less applicable withholding as described in Paragraph 10(a)) will be delivered (by book entry credit to your Account) in respect of the amount of Outstanding Fixed Allowance RSUs listed next to that date. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within the 30-Business-Day period following the Delivery Date to deliver RSU Shares in respect of all or a portion of the Fixed Allowance RSUs with the same Delivery Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Delivery Date for purposes of this Award. Until such delivery, you have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor, and no rights as a shareholder of GS Inc. Without limiting the Committee s authority under Section 1.3.2(h) of the Plan, the Firm may accelerate any Delivery Date by up to 30 days. 
 Transfer Restrictions Following Delivery 
 7. Transfer Restrictions and Shares at Risk . Fifty percent of the RSU Shares that are delivered on any date, before tax withholding (or, if the applicable tax withholding rate is greater than 50 , all RSU Shares delivered after tax withholding), will be Shares at Risk. This means that if, for example, on a Delivery Date, you are scheduled to receive delivery of 1,000 RSU Shares, and you are subject to a 40 withholding rate, then (a) 400 RSU Shares will be withheld for taxes, (b) 500 RSU Shares delivered to you will be Shares at Risk and (c) 100 RSU Shares delivered to you will not be subject to Transfer Restrictions. Any purported sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, 

hypothecation, fractionalization, hedge or other disposition in violation of the Transfer Restrictions on Shares at Risk will be void. Within 30 Business Days after the applicable Transferability Date listed on your Award Statement (or any other date on which the Transfer Restrictions are to be removed), GS Inc. will remove the Transfer Restrictions. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within such 30-Business-Day period on which to remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Shares at Risk with the same Transferability Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award. 
 Dividends 
 8. Dividend Equivalent Rights and Dividends . Each Fixed Allowance RSU includes a Dividend Equivalent Right, which entitles you to receive an amount (less applicable withholding), at or after the time of distribution of any regular cash dividend paid by GS Inc. in respect of a share of Common Stock, equal to any regular cash dividend payment that would have been made in respect of an RSU Share underlying your Outstanding Fixed Allowance RSUs for any record date that occurs on or after the Date of Grant. In addition, you will be entitled to receive on a current basis any regular cash dividend paid in respect of your Shares at Risk. 
 Exceptions to Delivery and or Transferability Dates 
 9. Accelerated Delivery and or Release of Transfer Restrictions in the Event of a Qualifying Termination After a Change in Control, Conflicted Employment or Death . In the event of your Qualifying Termination After a Change in Control, Conflicted Employment or death, each as described below, your Outstanding RSUs and Shares at Risk will be treated as described in this Paragraph 9. 
 (a) You Have a Qualifying Termination After a Change in Control . If your Employment terminates when you meet the requirements of a Qualifying Termination After a Change in Control, the RSU Shares underlying your Outstanding Fixed Allowance RSUs will be delivered, and any Transfer Restrictions will cease to apply.

The payment will be in an amount (less applicable withholding) equal to such regular dividend payment as would have been made in respect of the RSU Shares underlying such Outstanding Fixed Allowance RSUs. 
 (g) The timing of delivery or payment referred to in Paragraph 9(b)(i) will be the earlier of (i) the Delivery Date or (ii) a date that is within the calendar year in which the Committee receives satisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment,

 (i) Delivery of RSU Shares in respect of any Award may be made, if and to the extent elected by the Committee, later than the Delivery Date or other date or period specified hereinabove (but, in the case of any Award that constitutes 409A Deferred Compensation, only to the extent that the later delivery is permitted under Section 409A).

 4. Definitions . Unless otherwise defined herein, including in the Definitions Appendix or any other Appendix, capitalized terms have the meanings provided in the Plan. 
 Vesting of Your Fixed Allowance Restricted Shares 
 5. Vesting . All of your Fixed Allowance Restricted Shares are Vested.

 Transfer Restrictions 
 6. Transfer Restrictions . Fixed Allowance Restricted Shares will be subject to Transfer Restrictions until the applicable Transferability Date next to such number or percentage of Restricted Shares on your Award Statement. Any purported sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, fractionalization, hedge or other disposition in violation of the Transfer Restrictions will be void. Within 30 Business Days after the applicable Transferability Date listed on your Award Statement (or any other date on which the Transfer Restrictions are to be removed), GS Inc. will remove the Transfer Restrictions. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within such 30-Business-Day period on which to remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Restricted Shares with the same Transferability Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award.

If your Employment terminates solely because you resign to accept Conflicted Employment or if, following your termination of Employment, you notify the Firm that you are accepting Conflicted Employment, unless prohibited by applicable law or regulation, any Transfer Restrictions will cease to apply as soon as practicable after the Committee has received satisfactory documentation relating to your Conflicted Employment.

 1. You Must Decide Whether to Accept this Award Agreement . To be eligible to receive your Award, you must by the date specified (a) open and activate an Account and (b) agree to all the terms of your Award by executing the related signature card in accordance with its instructions. By executing the signature card, you confirm your agreement to all of the terms of this Award Agreement, including the arbitration and choice of forum provisions in Paragraph 16. 
 Documents that Govern Your Award Definitions 
 2. The Plan . Your Award is granted under the Plan, and the Plan s terms apply to, and are a part of, this Award Agreement. 
 3. Your Award Statement . The Award Statement delivered to you contains some of your Award s specific terms. For example, it contains the number of PSUs subject to this Award, the Performance Period and the Performance Goal applicable to your Award. It also contains the Determination Date and the any applicable Settlement Date s for your Award and the any applicable Transferability Date s for any Shares at Risk that may be delivered to you in respect of any Settlement Amount that you may earn. The number of PSUs on your Award Statement is not necessarily the number of PSUs in respect of which the Settlement Amount will be earned, but is merely the basis for determining the amount (if any) that will be delivered to you. 
 4. Definitions . Unless otherwise defined herein, including in the Definitions Appendix or any other Appendix, capitalized terms have the meanings provided in the Plan. 
 Vesting of Your PSUs 
 5. Vesting . Your PSUs are Vested. When a PSU is Vested, it means only that your continued active Employment is not required to earn delivery in respect of that PSU. Vesting does not mean you have a non-forfeitable right to the Vested portion of your Award. The terms of this Award Agreement (including conditions to delivery, satisfaction of the Performance Goal and any applicable Transfer Restrictions) continue to apply to your Award, and failure to meet such terms may result in the termination of this Award (as a result of which no delivery in respect of such Vested PSUs would be made) and you can still forfeit Vested PSUs and Shares at Risk. 
 Performance Goal 
 6. Performance . The Settlement Amount is dependent, and may vary based, on achievement of the Performance Goal over the Performance Period. On the Determination Date, the Firm will determine whether or not, and to what extent, the Performance Goal for that Performance Period has been satisfied. All your rights with respect to the Settlement Amount (and any Dividend Equivalent Payments) are dependent on the extent to which the Performance Goal is achieved, and any rights to delivery in respect of your Outstanding PSUs immediately will terminate and no Settlement Amount will be delivered in respect of such PSUs upon the Committee s determination, in its sole discretion, that the Performance Goal has not been satisfied to the extent necessary to result in delivery in respect of the PSUs. 
 Settlement Amount 

7. Settlement . 
 (a) In General . Subject to satisfaction of the terms of this Award, including satisfaction of the Performance Goal, on the Settlement Date, you will receive delivery (less applicable withholding as described in Paragraph 13(a)) of the Settlement Amount and payment of any Dividend Equivalent Payments as further described in this Award Agreement and in your Award Statement. Until such delivery and payment , you have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor and you do not have any rights as a shareholder of GS Inc. with respect to either the PSUs or the Settlement Amount. Without limiting the Committee s authority under Section 1.3.2(h) of the Plan, the Firm may accelerate any Settlement Date by up to 30 days. 
 (b) Form of Delivery . The Settlement Amount will be delivered on the Settlement Date as follows 
 (i) ___ in the form of cash . 
 (ii) ___ in the form of Shares at Risk (by book entry credit to your Account) . 
 (c) Shares at Risk . ___ percent of the Shares delivered to you in respect of the Settlement Amount will be Shares at Risk subject to Transfer Restrictions until the applicable Transferability Date listed on your Award Statement . Any purported sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, fractionalization, hedge or other disposition in violation of the Transfer Restrictions on Shares at Risk will be void. Within 30 Business Days after the Transferability Date listed on your Award Statement (or any other date on which the Transfer Restrictions are to be removed), GS Inc. will remove the Transfer Restrictions. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within such 30-Business-Day period on which to remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Shares at Risk with the same Transferability Date and all such dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award. 
 Dividend Equivalent Rights Dividends 
 8. Dividend Equivalent Rights . Dividends . To the extent described in your Award Statement, each PSU will include a Dividend Equivalent Right, which will be subject to the provisions of Section 2.8 of the Plan. Accordingly, for each of your Outstanding PSUs with respect to which delivery is made under the Settlement Amount, you will be entitled to payments under Dividend Equivalent Rights equal to any regular cash dividend paid by GS Inc. in respect of a Share the record date for which occurs on or after the Date of Grant. The payment to you of amounts under Dividend Equivalent Rights (less applicable withholding as described in Paragraph 13(a)) is conditioned upon the delivery under the Settlement Amount in respect of the PSUs to which such Dividend Equivalent Rights relate, and you will have no right to receive any Dividend Equivalent Payments relating to PSUs for which you do not receive delivery under the Settlement Amount (including, without limitation, due to a failure to satisfy the Performance Goal). Dividend Equivalent Payments will be paid on the Settlement Date. You will be entitled to receive on a current basis any regular cash dividend paid in respect of your Shares at Risk. The PSUs do not include Dividend Equivalent Rights. 
 Forfeiture of Your Award 
 9. How You May Forfeit Your Award . This Paragraph 9 sets forth the events that result in forfeiture of up to all of your PSUs and Shares at Risk and may require repayment to the Firm of up to all amounts previously paid or delivered to you under your PSUs in accordance with Paragraph 10. More than one event may apply, and in no case will the occurrence of one event limit the forfeiture and repayment obligations as a result of the occurrence of any other event.

1. I have received and agree to be bound by The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (the SIP and the Award Agreement(s) applicable to me in connection with the _______________ Award(s) (the Award(s) that I have been granted by the Firm (as defined in the SIP).

As a condition of this grant, I agree to provide upon request an appropriate certification regarding my U.S. tax status on Form W-8BEN, Form W-9, or other appropriate form, and I understand that failure to supply a required form may result in the imposition of backup withholding on certain payments I receive pursuant to this grant. 
 
 I irrevocably grant full power and authority to GS Inc. to register in its name, or that of any designee, any and all Restricted Shares (as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), Shares at Risk (as defined in the applicable Award Agreement) or other shares of GS Inc. common stock that have been or may be delivered to me subject to transfer restrictions or forfeiture provisions, and I irrevocably authorize GS Inc., or its designee, to sell, assign or transfer such shares to GS Inc. or such other persons as it may determine in the event of a forfeiture of such shares pursuant to any agreement with GS Inc. 
 Further, as a condition of this grant, if I am a person who has worked in the United Kingdom at any time during the earnings period relating to any award under the SIP, as determined by the Firm, when requested and as directed by the Firm, I will agree to a Joint Election under s431 ITEPA 2003 of the laws of the United Kingdom for full or partial disapplication of Chapter 2 Income Tax (Earnings and Pension) Act 2003 under the laws of the United Kingdom and will sign and return such election in respect of all future deliveries of Shares underlying the Award(s) and any previous grants made to me under the SIP and understand that the Firm intends to meet its delivery obligations in Shares with respect to my Award(s), except as may be prohibited by law or described in the accompanying Award Agreement(s) or supplementary materials. 
 If I have worked in Switzerland at any time during the earnings period relating to the Award(s) granted to me as determined by the Firm, (i) I acknowledge that my Award(s) are subject to tax in accordance with the rulings and method of calculation of taxable values to be agreed by the Firm with the Federal and or Zurich Geneva cantonal communal tax authorities or as otherwise directed by the Firm, and (ii) I hereby agree to be bound by any rulings agreed by the Firm in respect of any Award(s), which is expected to result in taxation at the time of delivery of Shares, and (iii) I undertake to declare and make a full and accurate income tax declaration in respect of my Award(s) in accordance with the above ruling or as directed by the Firm.

I understand that the Notice Policy will also apply with respect to my One-Time Awards (with the references to Year-End deemed to be references to One-Time in this context.) By executing this form, I am agreeing to be bound by the Notice Policy as in effect from time to time and, where applicable, am agreeing to a permanent change in the terms and conditions of my employment. I agree to this change in consideration of my continued employment with the Firm and the Firm s offer of the Award(s).

 In Japan and Asia Ex-Japan (including Australia and New Zealand and excluding India) 90 days in advance of my termination date if I am a Vice President or an Executive Director 60 days in advance of my termination date in all other cases. 
 
 If, under local law or a written contract with the Firm (for example, a Managing Director Agreement or Non-Competition Agreement), I have a notice requirement that is longer than those specified above, I understand that the longer notice period will apply. I also understand that if my employment is subject to a probation period, the Notice Policy applies only if notice of termination is given after the probation period has ended. 
 I understand that if I fail to comply in any respect with the Notice Policy, I will have failed to meet an obligation I have under an agreement with the Firm, as a result of which the Firm may have certain legal and equitable rights and remedies, including, without limitation, forfeiture of the Award(s) and any other awards granted to me under the SIP. The Firm may forfeit such Award(s) for violation of the Notice Policy irrespective of whether this agreement constitutes a legally recognized permanent change to my terms and conditions of employment, and irrespective of whether applicable law permits me to make a payment in lieu of notice. In addition, the Firm may seek an order or injunction from a court or arbitration panel to stop a breach and may also seek other permissible remedies. 

The Firm may hold me personally liable for any damages it suffers as a result of the breach.

I also agree to open an Account with any other custodian, broker, trustee, transfer agent or similar party selected by the Firm, if the Firm, in its sole discretion, requires me to open an account with such custodian, broker, trustee, transfer agent or similar party as a condition to delivery of Shares underlying the Award(s).

If the Firm advanced or loaned me funds to pay certain taxes (including income taxes and Social Security, or similar contributions) in connection with the Award(s) (or does so in the future), and if I have not signed a separate loan agreement governing repayment, I authorize the Firm to withhold from my compensation any amounts required to reimburse it for any such advance or loan to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
 I understand and agree that, if I leave the Firm, I am required immediately to repay any outstanding amount. I further understand and agree that the Firm has the right to offset, to the extent permitted by the Award Agreement and applicable law (including Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the Firm s ability to offset in the case of United States taxpayers under certain circumstances), any outstanding amounts that I then owe the Firm against its delivery obligations under the Award(s), against any obligations to remove restrictions and or other terms and conditions in respect of any Restricted Shares or Shares at Risk (each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement) or against any other amounts the Firm then owes me, including payments of dividends or dividend equivalent payments. I understand that the delivery of Shares pursuant to the Award(s) is conditioned on my satisfaction of any applicable taxes or Social Security contributions (collectively referred to as tax or taxes for purposes of the SIP and all related documents) in accordance with the SIP. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Firm, in its sole discretion, may require me to provide amounts equal to all or a portion of any Federal, State, local, foreign or other tax obligations imposed on me or the Firm in connection with the grant, vesting or delivery of the Award(s) by requiring me to choose between remitting such amount (i) in cash (or through payroll deduction or otherwise), (ii) in the form of proceeds from the Firm s executing a sale of Shares delivered to me pursuant to the Award(s) or (iii) as otherwise permitted in the Award Agreement(s). However, in no event shall any such choice determine, or give me any discretion to affect, the timing of the delivery of Shares or payment of tax obligations. 
 6. In connection with any Award Agreement or other interest I may receive in the SIP or any Shares that I may receive in connection with the Award(s) or any award I have previously received or may receive, or in connection with any amendment or variation thereof or any documents listed in paragraph 7, I hereby consent to (a) the acceptance by me of the Award(s) electronically, (b) the giving of instructions in electronic form whether by me or the Firm, and (c) the receipt in electronic form at my email address maintained at Goldman Sachs or via Goldman Sachs intranet site (or, if I am no longer employed by the Firm, at such other email address as I may specify, or via such other electronic means as the Firm and I may agree) all notices and information that the Firm is required by law to send to me in connection therewith including, without limitation, any document (or part thereof) constituting part of a prospectus covering securities that have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the information contained in any such document and any information required to be delivered to me under Rule 428 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, including, for example, the annual report to security holders or the annual report on Form 10-K of GS Inc. for its latest fiscal year, and that all prior elections that I may have made relating to the delivery of any such document in physical form are hereby revoked and superseded. I agree to check Goldman Sachs intranet site (or, if I am no longer employed by the Firm, such other electronic site as notified to me by the Firm) periodically as I deem appropriate for any new notices or information concerning the SIP. I understand that I am not required to consent to the receipt of such documents in electronic form in order to receive the Award(s) and that I may decline to receive such documents in electronic form by contacting ___________________, which will provide me with hard copies of such documents upon request.

I acknowledge that any such authorization is effective from the date of acceptance of my Award(s) until such time as I expressly revoke the authorization by written notice to any appropriate representative of the Firm. I understand that this authorization does not create any obligation on the Firm to deal with any such notifications, filings or remittances of funds that I may be required to make in connection with the SIP and I accept full responsibility in this regard. 
 9. The granting of the Award(s), the delivery of the underlying Shares and any subsequent dividends or dividend equivalent payments, and the receipt of any proceeds in connection with the Award(s) may result in legal or regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions.

 11. The goodwill associated with the relationships between the Firm and its clients and prospective clients is a valuable asset of the Firm that is built and preserved through the combined services and efforts of the Firm and all of its personnel.

Accordingly, I acknowledge and agree that (i) because the Firm contributes valuable resources to build and enhance client relationships, including those for which I provide services, it has a legitimate and essential business interest in protecting the goodwill associated with those relationships (ii) by my continued employment, I confirm that I have assigned and will assign to the Firm all goodwill I have developed or will develop with persons or entities with whom I interact while at the Firm and or who are or will become clients or prospective clients of the Firm in connection with my employment with the Firm, even if I did business with such persons or entities prior to joining the Firm and (iii) while at the Firm I do not have and will not acquire any property, proprietary, contractual or other legal right or interest whatsoever in or to any client or prospective client with whom I interact or conduct business while employed by the Firm or (except to the extent otherwise provided in a written agreement between the Firm and me that governs my compensation) to any current or prospective revenues associated with such client or prospective client (all such interests being referred to herein as Intangible Interests ). For the avoidance of doubt, I am hereby assigning all Intangible Interests to the Firm. I acknowledge and agree that my compensation during the term of my employment with the Firm is adequate financial consideration in this regard, and that no further consideration is necessary (including in respect of obligations applicable to me after my employment with the Firm has ended).

 Other Legal Notices 
 By accepting (whether expressly or by implication) any benefit granted to me by the Firm, including, without limitation, my Award(s), I acknowledge and agree to each of the following 
 No Public Offer Awards under the SIP and the Firm s other compensation and benefit programs are strictly limited to eligible participants and are not intended to constitute a public offer in any jurisdiction, nor intended for registration in any jurisdiction outside of the United States. I must keep all Award-related documents confidential and I may not reproduce, distribute or otherwise make public any part of such documents without the Firm s express written consent. If I have received any such documents and I am not the intended recipient, I will disregard and destroy them. 
 Transferability Any provisions permitting transfers to a third party in the Award documents will not apply to me (i) to the extent that the applicability of those provisions would affect the availability of relevant exemptions or tax favorable treatment, or (ii) otherwise in circumstances determined by the Firm in its sole discretion from time to time. 
 Adequate Information I acknowledge that (i) I have been provided with all relevant information and materials with respect to the Firm s operations and financial conditions and the terms and conditions of my Award(s), (ii) I have read and understood such information and materials, (iii) I am fully aware and knowledgeable of the terms and conditions of my Award(s), and (iv) I completely and voluntarily agree to the terms and conditions of my Award(s). 
 
 Independent Advice Recommended The information provided by the Firm or its service providers in respect of an Award does not take into account the individual circumstances of recipients and does not constitute legal, investment or tax advice. Awards under the SIP involve certain risks and I should exercise caution. The Firm recommends that I consult my own independent legal, investment and tax advisors in all cases, and I acknowledge that I am provided with adequate opportunity to do so. 
 Share Price and Currency Risks There is a risk that Shares may fall as well as rise in value. Market forces will impact the price of Shares and, in the worst case, the market value of the Shares may become zero. If the Shares are traded in a currency which is not the currency in my jurisdiction, the value of the Shares to me may also be affected by movements in the exchange rate. The Firm is not liable for any loss due to movements in the price of Shares or any applicable exchange rate. 
 
 No Employer Involvement Except to the extent required by applicable law, all Awards are offered, issued and administered by GS Inc., a Delaware corporation, and my employer (if it is not GS Inc.) is not involved in the grant of my Award(s) or any other GS Inc. equity compensation. All documents related to the Awards, including the SIP, the Award Agreement, this Signature Card, the Language Notice for Equity Awards and the link by which I access these documents, are originated and maintained in the United States. 

No Effect on Employment-Related Rights Any compensation I receive (even on a regular and repeated basis) in connection with the SIP is discretionary and does not constitute part of my base or normal salary or wages. It does not affect my rights and obligations under the terms of my employment and it will not be taken into account (except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law) in determining any other employment-related rights I may have, including, without limitation, rights in relation to severance, redundancy or end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits. In particular, I waive any and all rights to compensation or damages in consequence of the termination of my employment for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights arise or may arise from me ceasing to have rights under, or be entitled to receive payment in respect of, the SIP, or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights, as a result of such termination. This waiver applies whether or not such termination amounts to wrongful or unfair dismissal. 
 
 No Additional Entitlements The grant of an Award is strictly discretionary and voluntary. Neither this Award (even if grants are made to me under the SIP on a regular and repeated basis) nor my employment contract implies any expectation or right in relation to (i) the grant of any award under the SIP or similar compensation in the future, (ii) the terms, conditions and amount of any award under the SIP or similar compensation that the Firm may decide to grant in the future, or (iii) continued employment or engagement. 
 Severability Unless another result is specifically provided for in an agreement to the contrary, if any provision (in whole or in part) of this Signature Card, the other Award documents, or any other document you execute as part of accepting the Award(s) (including but not limited to the Arbitration of Claims agreement) is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or incapable of being enforced, that provision will be excluded to the extent (only) of such invalidity or unenforceability. All other provisions will remain in full effect and, to the extent possible, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed replaced by a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable provision. 
 
 Country-Specific Legal Notices I have read the country-specific legal notices below that pertain to my place of employment and or residence (and also the location of my employer, if different), if any, and understand that they apply throughout the term of my Award(s). 
 NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION RESTRICTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES PROVIDING SERVICES IN ASIA 
 In addition to and without limiting any provisions in the SIP or the applicable Award Agreement(s) (including without limitation the Award vesting, delivery, forfeiture, termination or repayment provisions) unless provided otherwise in the Restrictions, if I am providing services to the Firm in Asia or to BGH, in view of my importance to the Firm and or BGH, I hereby agree to and acknowledge the following 
 (a) I hereby agree that the Firm or BGH would likely suffer significant harm if I associate with a Covered Enterprise during my employment and for some period of time after my employment ends. Accordingly, I hereby agree that I will not, without the written consent of the Firm or BGH, during the Restricted Period in the Geographic Area 
 (i) form, or acquire a 5 or greater equity ownership, voting or profit participation interest in, any Covered Enterprise or 
 (ii) associate (including, but not limited to, association as an officer, employee, partner, director, consultant, agent or advisor) with any Covered Enterprise and in connection with such association engage in, or directly or indirectly manage or supervise personnel engaged in, any activity 
 A. which is similar or substantially related to any activity in which I was engaged, in whole or in part, at the Firm or BGH, 
 B. for which I had direct or indirect managerial or supervisory responsibility at the Firm or BGH, or 
 C. which calls for the application of the same or similar specialized knowledge or skills as those utilized by me in my activities with the Firm or BGH, 
 each such activity being determined with reference to the one-year period immediately prior to the end of the Asia Service Period, and, in each such case, irrespective of the purpose of the activity or whether the activity is or was in furtherance of advisory, agency, proprietary or fiduciary business of either the Firm or BGH or the Covered Enterprise. 
 (By way of example only, this provision precludes an advisory investment banker from joining a leveraged-buyout firm, a research analyst from becoming a proprietary trader or joining a hedge fund, or an information systems professional from joining a management or other consulting firm and providing information technology consulting services or advice to any Covered Enterprise, in each case without the written consent of the Firm or BGH.) 
 (b) I hereby agree that during the Restricted Period, I will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, (1) Solicit a Client to transact business with a Covered Enterprise or to reduce or refrain from doing any business with the Firm or BGH, or (2) interfere with or damage (or attempt to interfere with or damage) any relationship between the Firm or BGH and a Client. 

- 4- 

(c) I hereby agree that during the Restricted Period, I will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly 
 (i) Solicit any Selected Firm Personnel to resign from the Firm or BGH 
 (ii) Solicit any Selected Firm Personnel to apply for or accept employment (or other association) with any person or entity other than the Firm or 
 (iii) participate in the hiring of any Selected Firm Personnel (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) by any person or entity other than the Firm, including, without limitation, participating in the identification of individuals for potential hire, and participating in any hiring decision. 
 I acknowledge and agree that I will be presumed to have violated this provision if, during the Restricted Period, any Selected Firm Personnel are Solicited or hired by any entity where I have, or will have, direct or indirect managerial responsibility for such Selected Firm Personnel provided, however, that if I demonstrate to the Firm s reasonable satisfaction that I was not involved in the solicitation or the hiring of the Selected Firm Personnel, I will not be presumed to have violated this Section (c). 
 (d) I acknowledge and agree that these Restrictions form part of my terms and conditions of employment. I also acknowledge and agree that these Restrictions supersede any part of any other agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes the SIP and the Award Agreement(s)), written or oral, that I am subject to in respect of the same subject matter unless I am notified in writing to the contrary. 
 (e) Prior to accepting employment with any other person or entity during the Restricted Period, I will provide any prospective employer with written notice of the Restrictions with a copy containing the prospective employer s name and contact information delivered simultaneously to the Firm. 
 (f) I understand that the Restrictions may limit my ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Firm or BGH. I acknowledge that a violation on my part of any of the Restrictions would cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the Firm or BGH. Accordingly, I agree that the Firm and or BGH will be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened violation of any of the Restrictions in addition to any other remedies it or they may have. In the event that I violate any of the Restrictions, I acknowledge that the Restricted Period shall automatically be extended by the period of time that I was in violation of the said Restriction(s). I also acknowledge that a violation of any of the Restrictions would constitute my failure to meet an obligation I have under an agreement between me and the Firm that was entered into in connection with my employment with the Firm and or BGH, may be detrimental to the Firm and or BGH and would constitute Cause for purposes of any equity-based awards granted to me by the Firm and or BGH and will result in my forfeiting such equity-based awards. 
 (g) If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Restrictions is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such provision will be deemed modified to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability and the remaining such provisions will not be affected thereby provided, however, that if any of the Restrictions are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum time period such court determines is acceptable to permit such provision to be enforceable, such Restrictions will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to modify such time period in order to make such provision enforceable hereunder. 
 (h) The promises contained in the Restrictions are provided by me for the benefit of each Firm entity and BGH and I acknowledge and agree that each such entity may independently enforce the Restrictions against me. Any benefit that I give or am deemed to have given by virtue of the Restrictions is received jointly and severally by each Firm entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Firm entity to which I provide services from time to time) and BGH. 
 (i) For the purposes of the Restrictions, GS Inc. enters into the SIP and Award Agreement(s) applicable to me in connection with the Award(s) in its own capacity and as agent for each other Firm entity and BGH. The consideration for the promises in these Restrictions is given to me by GS Inc. on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Firm entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Firm entity to which I provide services from time to time) and BGH. 
 (j) I acknowledge that the Restrictions set out in this clause are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the Firm and or BGH, and that, having regard to those interests, such restrictions do not impose an unreasonable burden on me. 
 (k) The Restrictions shall remain in full force and effect and survive the termination of my employment for any reason whatsoever. 
 (l) If I am subject to the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement for Select Employees in the Equities Division, or a Managing Director subject to a Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Managing Director Agreement, the Restrictions shall not apply to me. 
 (m) If I am a Private Wealth Management employee subject to an Employee Agreement Regarding Confidential and Proprietary Information and Materials and Non-Solicitation, I will be subject to the restrictions contained in clause (a) of the Restrictions but will not be subject to the restrictions contained in clauses (b) and (c) of the Restrictions.
