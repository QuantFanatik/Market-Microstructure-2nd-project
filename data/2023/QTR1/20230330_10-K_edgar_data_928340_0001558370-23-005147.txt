 was to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the Mexican potable water system (the Project ). On August 22, 2016, the Public Private Partnership Agreement for the Project (the APP Contract was executed between AdR, the Comisi n Estatal del Agua de Baja California CEA ), the Government of Baja California as represented by the Secretary of Planning and Finance and the Public Utilities Commission of Tijuana CESPT ). On June 29, 2020, the Director General of CEA and the Director General of CESPT terminated the APP Contract. As a result of the cancellation of the APP Contract, we discontinued all development activities associated with the Project and commenced active marketing efforts to sell the land NSC purchased for the Project. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CW-Cooperatief, NSC and AdR, as well as all expenses we incur in connection with our on-going international arbitration with the Mexico government to obtain reimbursement for the costs we incurred in connection with the Project are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Our Operations For fiscal year 2022, our retail water, bulk water, services and manufacturing segments generated approximately 27 , 35 , 31 and 7 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. For additional information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenue and long-lived assets, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements at ITEM 8 of this Annual Report. Retail Water Operations For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our retail water operations accounted for approximately 27 , and 33 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. This business produces and supplies potable water to end-users, including residential, commercial and government customers in the Cayman Islands. We sell water through our retail operations under a license issued in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government (the 1990 license that granted Cayman Water the exclusive right to provide potable water to customers within its licensed service area. Although the 1990 license was not expressly extended after January 2018, we continue to supply water under the terms of the 1990 license, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Pursuant to the 1990 license, Cayman Water has the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to its licensed service area, which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman: Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. The 1990 license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent express extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to operate under the terms of the 1990 license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with our understanding of its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the 1990 license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. We continue to pay the royalty of 7.5 of revenue we collect required under the 1990 license. In October 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office OfReg ). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands in April 2017, which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the negotiations with us for a new retail license from the WAC to OfReg in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg in July 2017 and such negotiations are ongoing. We have been informed during our retail license negotiations, both by OfReg and its predecessor in these negotiations, that the Cayman Islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license in a manner that could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license.

 See also ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Material Commitments, Expenditures and Contingencies - Cayman Water Retail License . Our retail operations in the Cayman Islands produce potable water at four seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman located at our Abel Castillo Water Works ACWW ), Britannia and West Bay sites. We own the land for our ACWW and West Bay plants and have entered into a lease for the land for our Britannia plant that expires January 1, 2027. The current aggregate production capacity of the two plants located at ACWW is 3.0 million gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the Britannia plant is 715,000 gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the West Bay plant is 885,000 gallons of water per day. Electricity to our plants is supplied by Caribbean Utilities Co. Ltd., a publicly traded utility company. We maintain diesel engine-driven standby generators at all three retail plant sites with sufficient capacity to operate our distribution pumps and other essential equipment during any temporary interruptions in electricity supply. Standby generation capacity is available at our ACWW plants and West Bay plant to operate a portion of the water production capacity as well. Our distribution system is connected to the distribution system of the WAC. In prior years, during emergencies, we have purchased water from the WAC for brief periods of time and have also sold potable water to the WAC from our retail plants. Our pipeline system on Grand Cayman covers the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas and consists of approximately 100 miles of potable water pipeline. We extend our distribution system periodically as demand warrants. We have a main pipe loop covering the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas. We place extensions of smaller diameter pipe off our main pipe to service new developments in our service area. This system of building branches from the main pipe keeps construction costs low and allows us to provide service to new areas in a timely manner. Developers are responsible for laying the pipeline within their developments at their own cost, but in accordance with our specifications. When a development is completed, the developer then transfers operation and maintenance of the pipeline to us. We bill our customers on a monthly basis based on metered consumption and bills are typically collected within 30 to 45 days after the billing date. Receivables not collected within 45 days subject the customer to disconnection from water service. Bad debts have historically represented less than 1 of our total annual retail sales. In addition to their past due invoice balance, customers that have had their service disconnected must pay re-connection charges. Historically, demand on our water production and pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year. Demand depends upon various factors, most notably rainfall amounts and the number of tourists during any particular time of the year. In general, the majority of tourists come from the United States during the winter which is also the dry season in the Cayman Islands. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting cessation of tourism to the Cayman Islands significantly reduced demand for our water. In August 2022, the Cayman Islands government lifted the COVID-19 pandemic related travel restrictions that had eliminated tourist travel to the Cayman Islands since March 2020. Bulk Water Operations For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our bulk water operations accounted for approximately 35 , and 40 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. These operations produce potable water from seawater and sell this water to government-owned utilities in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas, which then distribute the water to end users. Bulk Water Operations in the Cayman Islands Through our wholly-owned subsidiary OC-Cayman we provide bulk water to the WAC, a government-owned utility and regulatory agency, under two agreements. The WAC in turn distributes that water to properties in Grand Cayman outside of our retail license area. The water we provide to the WAC is produced at three seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman owned by the WAC but designed, built and operated by OC-Cayman: the North Sound, Red Gate and North Side Water

 Works NSWW plants, which have production capacities of approximately 1.6 million, 1.3 million and 2.4 million gallons of water per day, respectively. The plants we operate for the WAC are located on land owned by the WAC. Our agreement with the WAC for the North Sound and Red Gate plants expires in 2024. Our agreement with the WAC for the NSWW plant expires in 2026. Bulk Water Operations in The Bahamas We sell bulk water in The Bahamas through our majority-owned subsidiary, CW-Bahamas, to the WSC, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the Island of New Providence. We supply bulk water in The Bahamas from our Windsor and Blue Hills plants. Our water supply agreement with the WSC for our Windsor plant, which has a capacity of 2.8 million gallons per day, expires in August 2033 and requires us to deliver and requires the WSC to purchase a minimum of 16.8 million gallons per week. We supply water from the Blue Hills plant, our largest seawater reverse osmosis desalination facility with a capacity of 12.0 million gallons per day, under the terms of a water supply agreement with the WSC that expires in March 2032 that requires us to deliver and requires the WSC to purchase a minimum of 63.0 million gallons of water each week. The high-pressure pumps at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants in The Bahamas are diesel engine-driven. Electricity for the remainder of our plant operations is supplied by Bahamas Power and Light Company BPL ). We maintain a standby generator with sufficient capacity to operate essential equipment at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants and are able to produce 100 of the production capacity with these plants during temporary interruptions in the electricity supply from BPL. Services Operations For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our services operations accounted for approximately 31 and 21 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. We provide design, engineering and construction services for desalination infrastructure projects through DesalCo, an original equipment manufacturer of seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants. DesalCo also provides management and procurement services for desalination plants and engineering services relating to municipal water production, distribution and treatment. DesalCo also conducts research and development. DesalCo sometimes tests new components and technology offered by suppliers in our business and, at times, collaborates with suppliers in the development of their products. Presently, DesalCo is providing management and purchasing services to our affiliate OC-BVI in the British Virgin Islands. In the past, DesalCo has provided consulting services to the WSC and constructed and sold desalination plants to the WAC, and is presently constructing the Red Gate desalination plant for the WAC. On October 24, 2019, we acquired 51 of the common stock of PERC, a U.S. company headquartered in Fountain Valley, California, which commenced operations in 1998. In August 2020, we acquired an additional 10 of PERC, increasing our ownership of this subsidiary to 61 . PERC develops, builds, and sells wastewater and water reuse infrastructure. PERC also provides management services for wastewater and water reuse infrastructure under long-term operations and maintenance contracts. PERC s primary markets are California and the Southwest U.S., but it conducts business in other areas of the U.S. In January 2023, we acquired the remaining 39 ownership interest in PERC. Manufacturing Operations For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 7 and 6 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. Our manufacturing operations consist of Aerex, an original equipment manufacturer and service provider of a wide range of specialized and custom products applicable to desalination, municipal water treatment and

 industrial water and wastewater treatment. Aerex s products include reverse osmosis desalination equipment, membrane separation equipment, filtration equipment, piping systems, vessels and custom fabricated components. Aerex s manufacturing facility and headquarters are located in Fort Pierce, Florida and substantially all of its customers are U.S. companies. Affiliate Operations Our affiliate, OC-BVI, sells water to the Government of the British Virgin Islands Water and Sewerage Department BVIW S ). We own 50 of the voting shares of OC-BVI and have an overall 43.53 equity interest in the profits of OC-BVI. We also own separate profit-sharing rights in OC-BVI that raise our effective interest in OC-BVI s profits from 43.53 to approximately 45 . Sage Water Holdings (BVI) Limited Sage owns the remaining 50 of the voting shares of OC-BVI and the remaining 55 interest in its profits. Under the Articles of Association of OC-BVI, we have the right to appoint three of the six Directors of OC-BVI. Sage is entitled to appoint the remaining three Directors. In the event of a tied vote of the Directors, the President of the Caribbean Water and Wastewater Association, a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives, is entitled to appoint a junior director to cast a deciding vote. Through DesalCo, we provide certain engineering and administrative services to OC-BVI for a monthly fee and a bonus arrangement which provides for payment of 4 of the net operating income of OC-BVI. We account for our investment in OC-BVI using the equity method of accounting. OC-BVI sells bulk water to BVIW S, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the islands of Tortola and Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. OC-BVI owns and operates a desalination plant located at Bar Bay, Tortola with a capacity of 720,000 gallons per day. Pursuant to a water supply agreement with the BVI government, OC-BVI is required to supply up to 600,000 gallons per day to the BVI government. This water supply agreement expires March 2031. OC-BVI purchases electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co. and operates diesel engine-driven emergency power generators which can produce 100 of the plant s production capacity when BVI Electric Co. is unable to provide power to the plant. OC-BVI s plant on the island of Jost Van Dyke has a capacity of 60,000 gallons per day. This plant operates under a 10-year contract with the BVI government that expired July 8, 2013. Pursuant to the contract, OC-BVI is operating the plant on a year-to-year basis until the BVI government informs OC-BVI of its intention to extend the existing contract or enter into a new agreement. We purchase electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co. Reverse Osmosis Technology The conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination. The primary method of seawater desalination used throughout the world is reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water (i.e. seawater) is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi-permeable membrane which rejects the salts. The saline water is first passed through a pretreatment system, which generally consists of fine filtration and treatment chemicals, if required. Pre-treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface. Next, a high-pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling approximately 40 conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane, while more than 99 of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain in the now concentrated saline water. This concentrate is discharged without passing through the membrane, and the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrate is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system. The final step is post-treatment, which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water and/or removing undesirable dissolved gases, adjusting the pH and (if necessary) the mineral content, and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution. We use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the desalination plants we construct and operate. We believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our markets. However,

 we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new, more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water. The equipment at our desalination plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner. As a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination, we believe our expertise and experience with respect to the development and operation of desalination plants and similar facilities is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas. Wastewater Treatment Technology Our wastewater treatment comprises various technologies which rely on the action of microorganisms to treat wastewater. The sequential batch reactor SBR technology we typically use is a conventional, proven method which has been used to treat organic wastewater for many years. More than 1,000 SBR treatment facilities are in use in the United States ranging in size from 10,000 gallons per day to 22 million gallons per day. Increasingly, we utilize membrane bioreactor MBR technology which utilizes micro or ultra-filtration membranes to enhance biological wastewater treatment. The improvements offered by MBR technology include a reduced physical footprint for the facility, higher quality treated effluent and the ability to treat more challenging influent. PERC has improved upon the standard SBR and MBR processes and whenever possible locates its equipment in concealed areas and in aesthetically pleasing buildings that minimize foul odors. Raw Materials and Sources of Supply All materials, parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology. Prior to our acquisition of Aerex, we did not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business. Aerex has manufactured key components for some of our desalination plants and we expect Aerex to continue to do so from time to time, however, our other businesses are not dependent on Aerex. Our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Seasonal Variations in Our Business Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands is affected by variations in the level of tourism and rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, global health concerns such as COVID-19, and increased costs of fuel and airfare. In the Cayman Islands, we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters of the year, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less than in the third and fourth quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting cessation of tourism to the Cayman Islands significantly reduced demand for our water in 2021. In August 2022, the Cayman Islands government lifted the COVID-19 pandemic related travel restrictions that had eliminated tourist travel to the Cayman Islands since March 2020. Demand in The Bahamas was not affected to the same degree by the drop in tourism resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The business conducted by Aerex and PERC is generally not subject to seasonal variations. Government Regulations, Custom Duties and Taxes Our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate. The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results. The following paragraphs set forth some of the key governmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the United States.

 Cayman Islands The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory with a stable political climate since 1670, when the Treaty of Madrid ceded the Cayman Islands to England. The King of England appoints the Governor of the Cayman Islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the Parliament of the Cayman Islands. The Parliament of the Cayman Islands consists of 19 elected members and two members appointed by the Governor from the Civil Service. The Cabinet is responsible for day-to-day government operations. The Cabinet consists of the Premier and six other ministers who are chosen by the Premier from its 19 popularly elected members, and the two Civil Service members. The elected members choose from among themselves a leader, who is designated the Premier, and is in effect the leader of the elected government. The Governor has reserved powers and the United Kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense. The Cayman Islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the United Kingdom. The Cayman Islands have no taxes on profits, income, distributions, capital gains or appreciation. We have exemptions from, or receive concessionary rates of customs duties on, certain capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the Cayman Islands under our retail water license. We do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes, electric pumps and motors, and chemicals, but we do pay duty at the rate of 10 of the cost, including insurance and transportation to the Cayman Islands, of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the Seven Mile Beach or West Bay areas. We have been advised by the Government of the Cayman Islands that we will not receive any duty concessions in any new retail water license signed with the government. The Bahamas The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the King of England as the constitutional head of state. The basis of the Bahamian law and legal system is the English common law tradition with a Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and a Magistrates court. Under the current laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, no income, corporation, capital gains or similar taxes are payable by us. We are required to pay an annual business license fee (the calculation of which is based on our preceding year s financial statements) which to date has not been material to the results of our Bahamas operations. We are also required to pay a value added tax on materials and services we purchase. British Virgin Islands The British Virgin Islands BVI is a British Overseas Territory, with the King of England as the Head of State and His Majesty s representative, the Governor, responsible for external affairs, defense and internal security, the Civil Service and administration of the courts. Since 1967, the BVI has held responsibility for its own internal affairs. The BVI Constitution provides for the people of the BVI to be represented by a ministerial system of government, led by an elected Premier, a Cabinet of Ministers and the House of Assembly. The House of Assembly consists of 13 elected representatives, the Attorney General, and the Speaker. The judicial system, based on English law, is under the direction of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which includes the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal. The ultimate appellate court is the Privy Council in London. Markets and Service Areas We operate in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, the United States and the British Virgin Islands. We believe that potential new markets for us include (i) any location where a need for potable water exists and reverse osmosis desalination of seawater or brackish water is an economically viable means of meeting such need; (ii) any location with a need for the water treatment and water reuse infrastructure development and management services we provide; and (iii) those new customers that require specialized water production and treatment products and systems such as those we manufacture.

 Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to the areas of Grand Cayman that are not within our licensed area, as well as to Cayman Brac. We operate all but one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the WAC on Grand Cayman and supply water under two agreements held by OC-Cayman with the WAC. According to the most recent information published by the Economics and Statistics Office of the Cayman Islands Government, the population of the Cayman Islands was estimated in 2021 to be 71,105 after the census count. According to the figures published by the Department of Tourism Statistics Information Center, in 2022 as compared to 2021, tourist air arrivals increased over 1000 to approximately 284,000 and tourist cruise ship arrivals increased from zero to approximately 743,000. We believe that our water sales in the Cayman Islands are more positively impacted by stay-over tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship, since cruise ship tourists generally only visit the island for one day or less and do not remain on the island overnight. Our water sales in the Cayman Islands are also greatly impacted by rainfall patterns and amounts on Grand Cayman. The Bahamas. The Bahamas government, through the WSC, supplies all of the piped water on the island of New Providence, Bahamas, which includes Nassau, the largest city, political capital and commercial hub of The Bahamas. We supply water to the WSC through the water supply agreements for our Blue Hills and Windsor plants, which are located in Nassau. New Providence is the most populous island in The Bahamas, with more than 70 of the country s population. A 2010 census placed the population of New Providence at approximately 246,000; more recent estimates suggest it is approximately 275,000. According to statistics published by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, the number of cruise ship arrival and air arrival tourists to New Providence were approximately 590,000 and 320,000, respectively, in 2020 and were approximately 465,000 and 650,000, respectively, in 2021. The most current data published by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism for 2022 shows that the number of cruise ship arrival and air arrival tourists were approximately 2,136,000 and 1,137,000, respectively. British Virgin Islands . The British Virgin Islands are a British Overseas Territory and are situated east of Puerto Rico. They consist of 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands, of which Tortola is the largest and most populated. The British Virgin Islands serve as a hub for many large yacht-chartering businesses. Competition Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our license granted by the Cayman Islands government, we have the exclusive right to provide potable, piped water within our licensed service area on Grand Cayman. The last express extension of this license expired on January 31, 2018. However, we continue to operate under the terms of this license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. Negotiations for a new license are on-going. We are the only non-government-owned public water utility on Grand Cayman. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to parts of Grand Cayman located outside of our licensed service area. Although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area for potable water, our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the Cayman Islands government. We have competed with such companies as SUEZ/Veolia, IDE Technologies and small local contractors for bulk water supply contracts with the WAC and expect to compete with these and other companies for any new water supply contracts awarded by the WAC. The Bahamas . We have competed with companies such as SUEZ/Veolia, IDE Technologies, and TSG for the contracts with The Bahamas government to build and operate seawater desalination plants in the past. We expect to compete with these companies and others for any future water supply contracts in The Bahamas. British Virgin Islands . In the British Virgin Islands, SUEZ/Veolia operates seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in West End, Tortola, and on Virgin Gorda and generally bids against OC-BVI for projects. Seven Seas Water owns and operates a 2.75 million gallon per day desalination plant in Parakeeta Bay, Tortola for the British Virgin Islands

 government. We expect that OC-BVI will be required to compete against SUEZ/Veolia, Seven Seas Water and other parties for any future business opportunities that may arise in the British Virgin Islands. United States . Aerex competes in the highly fragmented industry for manufactured water production and treatment equipment and systems against a large number of manufacturers, fabricators and service providers, many of which have greater resources than Aerex. Similar to Aerex, PERC competes in the highly fragmented industry for water treatment and water reuse infrastructure development and management against a large number of companies, many of which have greater resources than PERC. Environmental and Health Regulatory Matters Cayman Islands. With respect to our Cayman Islands operations, we operate our water plants in accordance with Cayman Islands laws and regulations. We are licensed by the WAC to extract seawater from wells and discharge concentrated seawater, which is a byproduct of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells. Our Cayman Islands retail water license and bulk water operating contracts require our potable water to meet the World Health Organization s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and contain less than 200 mg/l of total dissolved solids. The Bahamas and British Virgin Islands. With respect to our Bahamian operations and OC-BVI s British Virgin Islands operations, we and OC-BVI are required by our water supply contracts to take all reasonable measures to prevent pollution of the environment. We are licensed by the Bahamian government to discharge concentrated seawater, which is a by-product of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells. OC-BVI is licensed by the British Virgin Islands government to discharge concentrated seawater into the sea. At several of our locations, hydrogen sulfide gas is present in the seawater and we are contractually obligated to operate our plants in a manner designed to prevent the emission of airborne gas into the environment. United States. Consistent with other U.S. companies, Aerex and PERC must comply with various federal laws and regulations, such as those administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as state and local laws and regulations. We are not aware of any existing or pending environmental legislation which may negatively affect our operations. Presently, we do not have any outstanding issues with any regulatory authority. Human Capital We are committed to a work environment that is welcoming, inclusive and encouraging. To achieve our plans and goals, it is imperative that we attract and retain top talent. In order to do so, we aim to have a safe and encouraging workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop professionally, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and other incentives. We have historically experienced low employee turnover. As of March 24, 2023, we employed a total of 223 persons, 62 in the Cayman Islands, 140 in the United States, 19 in The Bahamas and two in The Netherlands. We also managed the five employees of OC-BVI in the British Virgin Islands. We have 13 management employees and 45 administrative and clerical employees. The remaining employees are engaged in engineering, purchasing, plant maintenance and operations, pipe laying and repair, leak detection, new customer connections, meter reading and laboratory analysis of water quality. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be very good. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of significant safety measures based on current guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for employees who work at our facilities.

RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves risks. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider carefully the factors discussed below and the information contained in this Annual Report. Each of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which may result in the loss of part, or all, of your investment. Our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the Cayman Islands has not been expressly extended and we are presently unable to predict the outcome of our on-going negotiations relating to this license. We sell water through our retail operations under a license issued in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government (the 1990 license that granted Cayman Water the exclusive right to provide potable water to customers within its licensed service area. Although the 1990 license was not expressly extended after January 2018, we continue to supply water under the terms of the 1990 license, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Pursuant to the 1990 license, Cayman Water has the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to its licensed service area, which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman Island: Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. In 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 27 and 33 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue and 44 and 47 , respectively, of our consolidated gross profit from the retail water operations conducted under the 1990 license. The 1990 license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent express extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to operate under the terms of the 1990 license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with our understanding of its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the 1990 license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. We continue to pay the royalty of 7.5 of revenue we collect required under the 1990 license. In October 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office OfReg ). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services, and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands in April 2017, which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the negotiations with us for a new retail license from the WAC to OfReg 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg in July 2017 and such negotiations are ongoing. We have been informed during our retail license negotiations, both by OfReg and its predecessor in these negotiations, that the Cayman Islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license in a manner that could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license. We are presently unable to determine what impact the resolution of our retail license negotiations will have on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations but such resolution could result in a material reduction (or the loss) of the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail operations and could require us to record impairment losses to reduce the carrying values of our retail segment assets. Such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Periodically, our Bahamas subsidiary experiences substantial delays in the collection of its accounts receivable. As a result, our Bahamas subsidiary could have insufficient liquidity to continue operations, and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected. CW-Bahamas accounts receivable balances (which include accrued interest) due from the WSC amounted to 16.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Approximately 65 of this December 31, 2022 accounts receivable balance was delinquent as of that date. The delay in collecting these accounts receivable has adversely impacted the liquidity of this subsidiary. From time to time (including presently), CW-Bahamas has experienced delays in collecting its accounts receivable from the WSC. When these delays occur, we hold discussions and meetings with representatives of the WSC and The Bahamas government, and as a result, payment schedules are developed for WSC s delinquent accounts receivable. All previous delinquent accounts receivable from the WSC, including accrued interest thereon, were eventually paid in full. Based upon this payment history, CW-Bahamas has never been required to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for any of its accounts receivable, despite the periodic accumulation of significant delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2022, we have not provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for CW-Bahamas accounts receivable from the WSC. In its latest report dated October 6, 2022, Moody s Investor Services Moody s downgraded the Government of The Bahamas long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B1 from Ba3. Moody s also lowered The Bahamas local currency ceiling to Baa3 from Baa2 and its foreign currency ceiling to Ba1 from Baa3. If CW-Bahamas is unable to collect a significant portion of its delinquent accounts receivable, one or more of the following events may occur: (i) CW-Bahamas may not have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations; (ii) we may be required to cease the recognition of revenue on CW-Bahamas water supply agreements with the WSC; and (iii) we may be required to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for CW-Bahamas accounts receivable. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Most of our services segment revenue is generated under short-term contracts. An inability to obtain extensions of these contracts or to obtain new contracts to replace the revenue that is lost from contracts that are not extended could adversely impact our financial results. PERC, our principal services segment subsidiary, generates most of its revenue from contracts O M contracts to operate and maintain water treatment and reuse facilities owned by third parties. For 2022, we generated revenue of approximately 13.7 million under these O M contracts. PERC s O M contracts have terms ranging from one to ten years, with varying renewal options exercisable solely at the discretion of the customer. Approximately 16 of PERC s revenue for 2022 was generated under O M contracts that expire at various dates through December 31, 2023. If we are unable to obtain extensions of these expiring O M contracts or are unable to replace the revenue lost from contracts that expire with revenue from new O M contracts, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely affected.

 If the future financial performance of Aerex falls short of our most recent financial projections for this subsidiary, we may be required to record impairment losses to reduce the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets of our manufacturing segment. Approximately 80 of Aerex s revenue, and 89 of Aerex s gross profit, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated from sales to one customer. While Aerex sells various products to this customer, Aerex s revenue from this customer has historically been derived primarily from one specialized product. In October 2020, this customer informed Aerex that, for inventory management purposes, it was suspending its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex following 2020 for a period of approximately one year. This customer informed Aerex at that time that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex beginning with the first quarter of 2022. As a result of this anticipated loss of revenue for Aerex, we updated our projections for our manufacturing reporting unit s future cash flows. Such projections assumed, in part, that Aerex s major customer would recommence its purchases from Aerex in 2022 but at a reduced aggregate amount, as compared to 2020. Based upon these updated projections, we tested our manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment as of December 31, 2020 using the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, with a weighting of 80 and 20 applied to these two methods, respectively. As a result of these impairment tests, we determined that the estimated fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 31 as of December 31, 2020. In late July 2021, this former major customer communicated to Aerex that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex in 2022 and subsequent years, but informed Aerex that such purchases would be at substantially reduced annual amounts, as compared to the amounts it had purchased from Aerex in 2020 and prior years. Our updated sales estimate for this customer based on this new information was substantially below the anticipated sales to this customer for 2022 and subsequent years that we used in the discounted cash flow projections we prepared for purposes of testing our manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment as of December 31, 2020. Furthermore, Aerex s efforts to replace the revenue previously generated from this customer with revenue from existing and new customers were adversely impacted by the negative economic conditions (caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic). These negative economic conditions also increased Aerex s raw material costs, resulted in raw material shortages and extended delivery times for such materials, and adversely affected the overall financial condition of Aerex s current and prospective customer base. Accordingly, in light of this new information from Aerex s former major customer and the on-going weak economic conditions that we believed would continue through 2022, we updated our projections of future cash flows for the manufacturing reporting unit and tested its goodwill for possible impairment as of June 30, 2021 using the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, with a weighting of 80 and 20 applied to these two methods, respectively. Based upon this testing, we determined that the carrying value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 2.9 million, and we recorded an impairment loss to reduce our manufacturing segment s goodwill by this amount for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The accounting estimates and assumptions we employ to estimate the fair values of our manufacturing and reporting units constitute critical accounting estimates for us because: the nature of these estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change (for example, should interest rates rise significantly in the future we would likely be required to increase the discount rate we use under the discounted cash flow method we use to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, and such increased discount rate in and of itself could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow method); and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition and results of operations is material. 
 We believe the inherent uncertainties associated with the accounting estimates and assumptions we use for our estimates of our reporting units fair values have increased due to current, less predictable economic conditions, which have resulted in increasing raw material prices, extended and unexpected delays in the procurement and delivery of our raw materials, and have also, we believe, adversely affected our customers. Based upon our estimation prepared as of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 63 . If we determine in the future that Aerex s discounted future cash inflows will be less than our present expectations, we may be required to record additional impairment losses to reduce the remaining carrying values

 of our manufacturing segment s goodwill and its remaining unamortized intangible assets balances, which amounted to 1,985,211 and 754,444, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Any such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Current economic conditions are adversely impacting the supply chain for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. As a result of the current economic conditions, we are experiencing issues with our supply chain for the raw materials, components, chemicals, and capital expenditures used in our operations, including rapidly increasing prices, scarcities/shortages, and longer fulfillment times and unexpected delays for our orders to suppliers. Should these economic conditions and issues continue, our operations could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The profitability of our contracts is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate construction and operating costs. The cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction and operation of our water plants, the water infrastructure we construct and sell to third parties, and our manufacturing contracts, are subject to inherent uncertainties. Additionally, the terms of our water supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis, subject to certain annual inflation and monthly energy cost adjustments, and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated. Because we base our contract prices in part on our estimation of future construction, manufacturing and operating costs, the profitability of our plants and our manufacturing and management contracts is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately. The cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for contract, which could cause the gross profit for a contract to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made. The profit margins we initially expect to generate from a management contract could be further reduced if future operating costs for that contract exceed our estimates of such costs. Any construction, manufacturing, and operating costs for our contracts that significantly exceed our initial estimates could have a material adverse impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Certain of PERC s contracts with its customers may be terminated at any time at the customer s convenience or with relatively short advance notice. The termination of any of these contracts prior to their full performance may result in us realizing less than the full consideration payable under the contract and may negatively impact our financial results. Certain of PERC s contracts with its customers, and substantially all of its contracts with governments or municipalities, may be terminated at any time at the customer s convenience with no or relatively short advance notice. Our business is highly dependent on the purchase of our products and services by government and municipalities, and we believe that contracts with similar termination provisions will continue to be a source of a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If a customer terminates one of our contracts for convenience, we generally may recover, at most, our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses, and payment for on work completed or products delivered prior to the termination. As such, the termination of any of these contracts prior to their stated term may result in us realizing less than the full consideration payable under the contract. If any such contract is terminated prior to us performing a substantial portion of the work to be performed or delivering a substantial portion of the products to be delivered, prior to the termination, such termination may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. A significant portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from our water supply agreements with the WSC. The loss of the WSC as a customer would adversely affect us. One bulk water customer, the WSC, accounted for approximately 32 of our consolidated revenue for 2022. If, for financial or other reasons, the WSC does not comply with the terms of our water supply agreements our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

 Our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations and other factors beyond our control that could affect the demand for our water. Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather, primarily rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, global health concerns such as COVID-19, and increased costs of fuel and airfare. In the Cayman Islands, we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters of the year, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less than in the third and fourth quarters. A downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting cessation of tourism to the Cayman Islands through August 2022 significantly reduced demand for our water. We are unable at this time to determine if or when demand for our water in the Cayman Islands will return to pre-pandemic levels. Performance shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract. Our bulk water supply agreements require us to meet specified minimum quality, quantity and energy consumption guarantees. Membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants, and if we are unable to meet the guarantees due to such technical problems, we could be in default of the supply agreement and subject to various adverse consequences, including financial penalties or cancellation of the agreement. Our operations could be harmed by natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes. A natural disaster could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers, including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation. For example, in January 2020, Grand Cayman experienced an earthquake which damaged three of our eight storage tanks. Any future disaster could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs. Damage to our customers properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand. A natural disaster could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies, including electricity, necessary to our operations. These and other possible effects of natural disasters could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Contamination of our water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenue . Our feed water and/or processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference, including acts of terrorism. If our feed water and/or processed water becomes contaminated, we may have to interrupt our supply of desalinated potable water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat contaminated feed or processed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. An inability by us to substitute feed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water or our processed water in a cost-effective manner may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Potential government decisions, actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations. We are subject to the local regulations of the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands, all of which are subject to change. Any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations, including but not limited to: restricting foreign ownership (by us);
 providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government;
 providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government;
 providing for different water quality standards;
 unilaterally changing or renegotiating our license and agreements;
 restricting the transfer of U.S. currency; or

 causing currency exchange fluctuations/devaluations or enacting changes in tax laws.
 As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy, which we may be unable to do in a cost-effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our authorizations to operate, the assessment of penalties or fines, or otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing water quality and contamination, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to water quality, the composition of our other products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with our operations, and climate change laws and regulations. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on operating in certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict. In addition, any complaints or lawsuits against us based on water quality and contamination may receive negative publicity that can damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and trading price of our common stock. If we fail to abide by laws, rules and regulations relating to human and workers rights, we could be subject to suit and our reputation could be harmed, which could result in losses in our business and financial results. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning human rights, including laws prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and forced or child labor, and establishing wage and hour standards. If we were to violate or become liable under human or workers laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions or liability. The amount and timing of costs to comply with human and workers rights laws are difficult to predict. Additionally, the success of our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, suppliers, stockholders and the communities in which we operate, our ability to compete for future opportunities, and our reputation among existing and potential clients and partners. Our reputation is critical to our business and could be impacted by events that may be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. For example, alleged or actual failures by us or our employees to comply with applicable human or workers rights laws, rules or regulations, expectations and perceptions of our employment and environmental, social and governance practices, threatened or actual litigation against us or our employees, or the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any of these issues, even if inaccurate, satisfactorily addressed, or if no violation or wrongdoing actually occurred, could adversely impact our reputation and relationships with customers, suppliers, stockholders and the communities in which we operate, and our ability to renew or negotiate new agreements for projects. Any such failure or reputational harm could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We rely on the efforts of key employees. Our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations. Our success depends upon the abilities of our Executive Officers. In particular, the loss of the services of Frederick W. McTaggart, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success. Mr. McTaggart has an employment agreement expiring on December 31, 2025. Each year, the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year. However, we cannot guarantee that Mr. McTaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will extend his employment agreement with us.

 Our business could be adversely affected by cyber threats or other interruptions in information technology, communications networks and operations. As part of our operations, we rely on computer systems to process transactions and communicate with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. We rely on continued and unimpeded access to secure network connections to communicate between locations and on reliable internet connections to communicate with external parties. We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches as well as fraudulent transactions and other activities. Despite these safeguards and our other security processes and protections, we cannot be assured that all our systems and processes are free from vulnerability to evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, to other physical breaches or to inadvertent data disclosure by third parties or by us. A significant data security breach, including misappropriation of customer, supplier or confidential employee information, could cause us to incur significant costs, which may include potential costs of investigations, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation, remediation and litigation, substantial repair or replacement costs. We could also experience data losses that would impair our ability to manage our business operations, including accounting and project costs, manage our water and distribution systems or process transactions and have a negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our business in general. We are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers. We are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands. We are also subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our customers in the United States. Adverse economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment. We depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis. Our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates. Although we report our results in United States dollars, most of our revenue is earned in other currencies. These currencies have been fixed to the United States dollar for more than 20 years. Consequently, we do not employ hedging strategies against the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with conducting business in foreign currencies while reporting in United States dollars. If any of the existing fixed exchange rates for these other currencies becomes a floating exchange rate and any of these currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We may not pay dividends in the future. If dividends are paid, they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends . Our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have paid dividends in the past but may cease to do so at any time. We may incur increased operating or development expenses or capital requirements or indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, covenants contained in financing agreements, and other factors considered by our Board of Directors. We may not continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, they may not be in amounts comparable to past dividends. Service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the United States may be difficult to obtain. We are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and most of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, six of our 14 Directors and Officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to execute service of process within the United States upon us and such other persons, or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts, and bring any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability

 provisions of the United States securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the United States, rights predicated upon the United States securities laws. Based on the advice of our Cayman Islands legal counsel, we believe no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments exists between the United States and the Cayman Islands, and that foreign judgments originating from the United States are not directly enforceable in the Cayman Islands. A prevailing party in a United States proceeding against us or our Directors and Officers would have to initiate a new proceeding in the Cayman Islands using the United States judgment as evidence of the party s claim. A prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the Cayman Islands, subject to available defenses in the Cayman Islands courts, including, but not limited to, the lack of competent jurisdiction in the United States courts, lack of due service of process in the United States proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the United States judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands. Depending on the nature of damages awarded, civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the Securities Act), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or the Exchange Act), for original actions instituted outside the Cayman Islands may or may not be enforceable. For example, a United States judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the Cayman Islands, such as treble damages, would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances. The relatively low trading volume of our stock may adversely impact the ability to sell our shares. The average daily trading volume of our common stock in 2022 was approximately 102,300 shares, a much lower trading volume than that of many other companies listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the limited volume of trading in our common stock, an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling larger volumes of our common stock in the manner, or at the price, that might be attainable if our common stock were more actively traded.

 (1) In estimated millions of gallons per day. Cayman Islands We have been operating our business on Grand Cayman since 1973 and have been using reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water since 1989. The Cayman Islands have a limited natural supply of fresh water. We have an exclusive license from the Cayman Islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas of Grand Cayman. This license expired in January 2018 but as discussed in the following paragraph we continue to provide water under the terms of this license. Our Grand Cayman operations consist of four company-owned seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants which provide water to approximately 7,950 retail residential and commercial connections within a government licensed area and three government-owned seawater reverse osmosis plants which supply bulk water to the WAC. Our pipeline system on Grand Cayman Island covers the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas of Grand Cayman and consists of approximately 100 miles of potable water pipe. Our exclusive license from the Cayman Islands government was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent express extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to operate under the terms of the 1990 license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with our understanding of its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the 1990 license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. We continue to pay the royalty required under the 1990 license. We have been informed during our retail license negotiations that the Cayman Islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license in a manner that could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license. Our retail license negotiations have also been impacted by the passage of new legislation and the establishment of a new water regulatory body in the Cayman Islands. See further discussion of this matter at ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Material Commitments, Expenditures and Contingencies - Cayman Water Retail License . The Bahamas CW-Bahamas produces potable water from two seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants. The Windsor plant and the Blue Hills plant are located in Nassau, New Providence and have a total installed capacity of 14.8 million gallons per day. CW-Bahamas supplies water from these plants to the Water and Sewerage Corporation of The Bahamas WSC under long-term supply agreements. During 2022, we supplied approximately 4.6 billion gallons of water to the WSC from these plants, as compared to 4.4 billion gallons during 2021. From time to time (including presently), CW-Bahamas has experienced delays in collecting its accounts receivable. Representatives of the Bahamas government have informed us that their delays in paying our accounts receivables did/do not reflect any type of dispute with us with respect to the amounts owed. To date, we have not been required to provide an allowance for any delinquent CW-Bahamas accounts receivable as such amounts were eventually paid in full. Based upon our experience, we believe that the present accounts receivable from the WSC are fully collectible and therefore have not provided any allowance for possible non-payment of these receivables. Such accounts receivable balances due from The Bahamas government amounted to 16.3 million as of December 31, 2022. See further discussion of this matter at ITEM 7.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies relate to (i) the valuations of our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets; and (ii) revenue recognition on our construction and manufacturing contracts. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ significantly from such estimates and assumptions. The application of our critical accounting policies involve estimates or assumptions that constitute critical accounting estimates for us because: the nature of these estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition and results of operations is material. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or upon the identification of a triggering event. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed periodically for impairment. We evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill annually as part of our reporting process for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Management identifies our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, which consist of Cayman Water, the bulk segment (which is comprised of CW-Bahamas and OC-Cayman), PERC, and the manufacturing segment (i.e., Aerex), and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare these fair values to the carrying amounts of the reporting units. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recorded. For 2021, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method, which relied upon seven-year discrete projections of operating results, working capital and capital expenditures, along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period. These seven-year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, and considered the impact of planned business and operational strategies. The discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of each analysis. We also estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units for 2021 by applying the guideline public company method. We weighted the fair values estimated for each of our reporting units under each method and summed such weighted fair values to estimate the overall fair value for each reporting unit. The respective weightings we applied to each method for 2021 were 80 to the discounted cash flow method and 20 to the guideline public company method. The fair values we estimated for our Cayman Water, bulk segment, PERC and manufacturing reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 32 , 51 , 15 and 15 , respectively, as of December 31, 2021. For 2022, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment testing we have conducted in prior years for all goodwill reporting units other than the manufacturing unit. We assessed the relevant events and circumstances to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units are less than their carrying values. The events and circumstances assessed for each unit included 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant events. Based upon this qualitative assessment we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our Cayman Water and bulk segment reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2022. Based upon our negotiated, arms-length purchase of the remaining 39 equity interest in PERC from its minority shareholders for 7.8 million in January 2023, the fair value of our PERC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 79 as of December 31, 2022. Due to the factors discussed in the following paragraphs, we elected to test the goodwill associated with our manufacturing reporting unit for possible impairment using the quantitative tests applied in prior years. In connection with our acquisition of Aerex in 2016, we recorded goodwill of 8,035,211. Aerex s actual results of operations for 2016 fell significantly short of the projected results that were included in the cash flow projections we utilized to determine the purchase price for Aerex and the fair values of its assets and liabilities. Due to this shortfall in Aerex s results of operations, we tested our manufacturing segment s goodwill for possible impairment and recorded an impairment loss of 1,750,000) in 2016. As part of our annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter, in 2017 we updated our projections for Aerex s future cash flows, determined that the carrying value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and recorded an impairment loss of 1,400,000) for December 31, 2017 to further reduce the carrying value of our manufacturing segment goodwill to 4,885,211. Approximately 80 of Aerex s revenue, and 89 of Aerex s gross profit, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated from sales to one customer. While Aerex sells various products to this customer, Aerex s revenue from this customer has historically been derived primarily from one specialized product. In October 2020, this customer informed Aerex that, for inventory management purposes, it was suspending its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex following 2020 for a period of approximately one year. This customer informed Aerex at that time that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex beginning with the first quarter of 2022. As a result of this anticipated loss of revenue for Aerex, we updated our projections for our manufacturing reporting unit s future cash flows. Such projections assumed, in part, that Aerex s major customer would recommence its purchases from Aerex in 2022 but at a reduced aggregate amount, as compared to 2020. Based upon these updated projections, we tested our manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment as of December 31, 2020 using the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, with a weighting of 80 and 20 applied to these two methods, respectively. As a result of these impairment tests, we determined that the estimated fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 31 as of December 31, 2020. In late July 2021, this former major customer communicated to Aerex that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex in 2022 and subsequent years, but informed Aerex that such purchases would be at substantially reduced annual amounts, as compared to the amounts it had purchased from Aerex in 2020 and prior years. Our updated sales estimate for this customer based on this new information was substantially below the sales we anticipated to this customer for 2022 and subsequent years that we used in the discounted cash flow projections we prepared for purposes of testing our manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment as of December 31, 2020. Furthermore, Aerex s efforts to replace the revenue previously generated from this customer with revenue from existing and new customers were adversely impacted by the negative economic conditions (caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic). These negative economic conditions also increased Aerex s raw material costs, resulted in raw material shortages and extended delivery times for such materials, and adversely affected the overall financial condition of Aerex s current and prospective customers. Accordingly, in light of this new information from Aerex s former major customer, and the on-going weak economic conditions that we believed would continue through 2022, we updated our projections of future cash flows for the manufacturing reporting unit and tested its goodwill for possible impairment as of June 30, 2021 using the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, with a weighting of 80 and 20 applied to these two methods, respectively. Based upon this testing, we determined that the carrying value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 2.9 million, and we recorded an impairment loss to reduce our manufacturing segment s goodwill by this amount for the three months ended June 30, 2021. For 2022, we estimated the fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit by applying the discounted cash flow method, which relied upon seven-year discrete projections of operating results, working capital and capital expenditures, along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period. These seven-year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, and considered the impact of planned business and

 operational strategies. The discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of each analysis. We also estimated the fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022 by applying the guideline public company method. We weighted the fair values estimated for our manufacturing reporting unit under each method and summed such weighted fair values to estimate the overall fair value for the reporting unit. The respective weightings we applied to each method for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 80 to the discounted cash flow method and 20 to the guideline public company method. The fair value we estimated for our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 63 as of December 31, 2022. We believe the inherent uncertainties associated with the accounting estimates and assumptions we use for our estimates of our manufacturing reporting unit s fair value have increased due to the current, less predictable economic conditions, which have resulted in increasing raw material prices, extended and unexpected delays in the procurement and delivery of our raw materials, and have also, we believe, adversely affected our customers. Should interest rates rise significantly in the future we would likely be required to increase the discount rate we use under the discounted cash flow method we use to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit, and such increased discount rate in and of itself could decrease the estimated fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method. As noted previously, based upon our estimation prepared as of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 63 . However, if we determine in the future that Aerex s discounted future cash inflows will be less than our present expectations, we may be required to record additional impairment losses to reduce the remaining carrying values of our manufacturing segment s goodwill and its remaining unamortized intangible assets balances, which amounted to 1,985,211 and 754,444, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Any such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations. Long-lived Assets We review the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we recognize an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value. On June 29, 2020, our Mexico subsidiary, AdR, received a letter from the State of Baja California (the State terminating AdR s contract with the State involving the construction and operation of a desalination plant in Rosarito California and accompanying aqueduct to deliver the water produced by this plant to the Mexican public water system. As a result of the cancellation of this contract, we recorded an impairment loss for rights of way acquired for the contract s proposed aqueduct of approximately 3.0 million) in 2020. Through our former subsidiary, PT Consolidated Water Bali CW-Bali ), we built and operated a seawater reverse osmosis plant with a productive capacity of approximately 264,000 gallons per day located in Nusa Dua, one of the primary tourist areas of Bali, Indonesia. We recorded operating losses for CW-Bali as the sales volumes for its plant were insufficient to cover its operating costs. In 2017 we determined, based upon probability-weighted scenarios for CW-Bali s future undiscounted cash flows, that the carrying values of CW-Bali s long-lived assets and our investment in CW-Bali were not recoverable. Consequently, we recorded impairment losses of 1.6 million) in 2017 to reduce the carrying values of these assets to their fair values. Construction and Manufacturing Contract Revenue Recognition We design, construct, and sell desalination infrastructure through DesalCo, which serves customers in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, and the British Virgin Islands. We design, construct, and sell wastewater and water reuse infrastructure in the U.S. through PERC. Aerex, is a custom and specialty manufacturer in the U.S. of water treatment-related systems and products applicable to commercial, municipal and industrial water production.

 We recognize revenue for our construction and our specialized/custom manufacturing contracts over time under the input method using costs incurred (which represents work performed) to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying a contract s performance obligations as such measure best reflects the transfer of control of the promised good to the customer. Contract costs include labor, materials and amounts payable to subcontractors. We follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to the various stages of a contract. Under this input method, we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses. We estimate total project or manufacturing costs and profit to be earned on each long-term, fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract and update these estimates as work on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date comprises of estimated total contract costs. If, as work progresses, the actual contract costs exceed estimates, the profit recognized on revenue from that contract decreases. We recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time the estimates indicate such a loss. The cost estimates we prepare in connection with our construction and manufacturing contracts are subject to inherent uncertainties. Because we base our contract prices on our estimation of future construction and manufacturing costs, the profitability of our construction and manufacturing contracts is highly dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately, as almost all of our construction and manufacturing contracts are fixed-price contracts. The cost of materials, labor and subcontractors could increase significantly after we sign a construction or manufacturing contract, which could cause the gross profit for a contract to decline from our previous estimates, adversely affecting our recognition of revenue and gross profit for the contract. Construction or manufacturing contract costs that significantly exceed our initial estimates could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under Part II, ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, of this Annual Report. Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Discontinued Operations Mexico Project Development In 2010, we began the pursuit, through our Netherlands subsidiary, Consolidated Water Cooperatief, U.A. CW-Cooperatief ), and our Mexico subsidiary, N.S.C. Agua, S.A. de C.V. NSC ), of a project (the Project that encompassed the construction, operation and minority ownership of a 100 million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and accompanying pipelines to deliver water to the Mexican potable water system. Through a series of transactions that began in 2012, NSC purchased 20.1 hectares of land for approximately 21.1 million on which the proposed Project s plant was to be constructed. Following an assessment by the State of Baja, California (the State of the need for such a desalination plant and the passage of enabling legislation in November 2015, the State officially commenced the required public tender for the Project. A consortium (the Consortium comprised of NSC, Suez Medio Ambiente M xico, S.A. de C.V. Suez MA ), a subsidiary of SUEZ International, S.A.S., and NuWater S.A.P.I. de C.V. NuWater submitted its tender for the Project in April 2016 and in June 2016, the State designated the Consortium as the winner of the tender process for the Project. In August 2016, NSC and NuWater incorporated a new company under the name Aguas de Rosarito S.A.P.I. de C.V. AdR to pursue completion of the Project and executed a shareholders agreement for AdR agreeing among other things that (i) AdR would purchase the land and other Project assets from NSC on the date that the Project begins commercial operation and (ii) AdR would enter into a Management and Technical Services Agreement with NSC effective on the first day that the Project begins commercial operation. NSC initially owned 99.6 of the equity of AdR. In February 2018, we acquired the remaining 0.4 ownership in AdR from NuWater.

 On August 22, 2016, the Public Private Partnership Agreement for the Project (the APP Contract was executed between AdR, the State Water Commission of Baja California CEA ), the Government of Baja California as represented by the Secretary of Planning and Finance and the Public Utilities Commission of Tijuana CESPT ). The APP Contract required AdR to design, construct, finance and operate a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant (and accompanying aqueduct) with a capacity of up to 100 million gallons per day in two phases: the first with a capacity of 50 million gallons per day and an aqueduct to the Mexican potable water system in Tijuana, Baja California and the second phase with a capacity of 50 million gallons per day. The first phase was to be operational within 36 months of commencing construction and the second phase was to be operational by July 2024. The APP Contract further required AdR to operate and maintain the plant and aqueduct for a period of 37 years starting from the commencement of operation of the first phase. At the end of the operating period, ownership of the plant and aqueduct would have been transferred to CEA. The APP Contract was subsequently amended by the parties in June 2018 to increase the scope of Phase 1 and to allow for changes in the water tariff due to the changes in the exchange rate for the peso, interest rates and construction costs that had and would occur from the date the APP Contract was signed to the date construction commenced. On June 29, 2020, AdR received a letter (the Letter from the Director General of CEA and the Director General of CESPT terminating the APP Contract. The Letter requested that AdR provide an inventory of the assets that currently comprise the Project Works (as defined in the APP Contract) for the purpose of acknowledging and paying the non-recoverable expenses made by AdR in connection with the Project, with such reimbursement to be calculated in accordance with the terms of the APP Contract. The applicable law required that this list of non-recoverable expenses made by AdR in connection with the Project be submitted to CEA and CESPT within 20 business days from the date of receipt of the Letter. AdR initiated an amparo claim before a federal district court in Tijuana, Baja California, to challenge the provision of the applicable law requiring submittal of the list of non-recoverable expenses within the 20 business days term, as AdR considered such term to be unreasonably short due to the magnitude of the Project and the scope of supporting documentation required to be provided with respect to the non-recoverable expenses. AdR obtained an initial provisional suspension of the lapsing of such 20-day term from the court, and on August 10, 2020 the court made such suspension definitive until the completion of the amparo trial. As such, the 20-day term for filing the list of non-recoverable expenses was suspended. Therefore, on August 28, 2020, AdR submitted their list of non-recoverable expenses, including those of NSC, to CEA and CESPT which was comprised of 51,144,525 United States dollars and an additional 137,333,114 Mexican pesos. In February 2021, AdR withdrew this amparo claim, and such withdrawal was accepted by the federal district court in Tijuana. To date, AdR has not received a formal response from CEA or CESPT to its submission of non-recoverable expenses. We believe CW-Cooperatief, as a Netherlands company, has certain rights relating to its investments in NSC and AdR under the Agreement on Promotion, Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Mexican States entered into force as of October 1, 1999 (the Treaty ). On April 16, 2021, CW-Cooperatief submitted a letter to the President of Mexico and other Mexican federal government officials alleging that the State s termination of the APP Contract constituted a breach by Mexico of its international obligations under the Treaty, entitling CW-Cooperatief to full reparation, including monetary damages. This letter invited Mexico to seek a resolution of this investment dispute through consultation and negotiation, but stated that if the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner, CW-Cooperatief elects to refer the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of International Disputes for arbitration, as provided for in the Treaty. On June 29, 2021, the Mexican Ministry of Economy responded to CW-Cooperatief s letter and proposed to hold a consultation meeting. Two such meetings were held on July 9, 2021 and August 2, 2021 on a confidential basis, without a resolution of our investment dispute. On February 9, 2022, CW-Cooperatief, filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of International Disputes requesting that the United Mexican States pay CW-Cooperatief damages in excess of US 51 million plus MXN 137 million (with the exact amount to be quantified in the proceedings), plus fees, costs and pre- and post-award interest. CW-Cooperatief intends to pursue vigorously the relief sought in the arbitration, in addition to pursuing all other legal remedies and courses of action available under the operative contracts and applicable law with respect to its rights, damages, fees and expenses. We cannot provide any assurances that CW Cooperatief will be able to obtain the relief sought in the arbitration, and we will incur legal and other arbitration-related expenses that we expect will be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

 During July 2022, the State initiated discussions with us to potentially resolve the issues related to the cancellation by the government of the Rosarito desalination plant contract as well as potentially addressing the State s acute water shortage issues. We cannot presently determine the outcome of the discussions and we have not terminated our efforts to obtain relief through the international arbitration process as a result of these discussions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain reimbursement for any expenses or investments made with respect to the Project. As a result of the cancellation of the APP Contract, in 2020 we discontinued all development activities associated with the Project and commenced active marketing efforts to sell the land NSC purchased for the Project. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of CW-Cooperatief, NSC and AdR, as well as the costs for our legal and administrative activities to pursue reimbursement from the State of Baja California following the cancellation of the APP Contract, are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our net losses from discontinued operations for 2022 and 2021 were 2,371,049) and 2,574,079), respectively. Our net losses from discontinued operations for 2022 and 2021 includes provisions of 377,326 and 963,540, respectively, for uncollectible value added taxes paid to, and reimbursable by, the Mexican federal government. Consolidated Results Including discontinued operations, net income attributable to Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. stockholders for 2022 was 5,856,294 0.38 per share on a fully diluted basis), as compared to 875,579 0.06 per share on a fully diluted basis) for 2021. The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 relates only to our continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. stockholders for 2022 was 8,227,343 0.54 per share on a fully diluted basis), as compared to 3,449,658 0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis) for 2021. Revenue for 2022 increased to 94,104,972 from 66,863,502 in 2021, as all four segments experienced revenue increases. Gross profit for 2022 was 30,355,123 (32 of total revenue) as compared to 23,507,191 (35 of total revenue) for 2021. For further discussion of revenue and gross profit see the Results by Segment discussion and analysis that follows. General and administrative expenses G A expenses on a consolidated basis increased to 21,070,234 for 2022 as compared to 18,350,359 for 2021. The most significant components of the increase in G A expenses for 2022 were incremental bonus accruals and stock compensation expense aggregating 1,248,242 arising from the improved financial performance of the Company. Other components of the G A expenses increase relate to (i) other employee costs, which increased by 399,268 due to salary increases and new hires; (ii) professional and legal fees, which increased by 148,663; (iii) insurance expense, which increased 254,599 due to higher premiums and (iv) incremental business development expenses of 170,461. The rise in G A for 2022 is also due in part to inflationary factors which have increased many of our G A expenses. Other income, net, decreased to 464,810 in 2022, as compared to 1,623,595 in 2021 primarily due to a loss of 128,000) recorded in 2022 for the valuation of the put/call options associated with the acquisition of PERC, as compared to a gain recorded on these options of 818,000 in 2021. In addition, interest income decreased by approximately 238,000 for 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the decrease in CW-Bahamas average delinquent accounts receivable balances due from the WSC.

 Results by Segment Retail Segment: The retail segment incurred a loss from operations of 1,187,013) for 2022 as compared to a loss from operations of 2,044,094) for 2021. Revenue generated by our retail water operations increased to 25,954,013 in 2022 from 22,104,953 in 2021 in part due to a 12.5 increase in the volume of water sold. The sales volumes for both 2022 and 2021 were below the historical volumes for the retail segment prior to 2020 due to the cessation of tourism on Grand Cayman resulting from border restrictions that lasted from March 2020 through August 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the volume of water sold in 2022 as compared to 2021 resulted from the lifting in August 2022 of such pandemic related travel restrictions. Retail revenue also increased due to higher energy costs which increased the energy pass-through component of our water rates and a more favorable rate mix, as much of the volume increase for the quarter was due to higher sales volumes to tourist industry related businesses, which in general purchase higher volumes and therefore pay higher per gallon rates than other retail customers. Retail segment gross profit increased to 13,405,250 (52 of retail revenue) for 2022 as compared to 11,044,016 (50 of retail revenue) for 2021 due to the revenue increase. Consistent with prior periods, we record all non-direct G A expenses in our retail segment and do not allocate any of these non-direct costs to our other three business segments. Retail G A expenses increased to 14,552,866 for 2022 as compared to 12,841,259 for 2021. The most significant components of the increase in G A expenses for 2022 were incremental bonus accruals and stock compensation expense of 976,501 arising from the improved financial performance of the Company. Other components of the G A expenses increase relate to (i) professional and legal fees, which increased by 167,445; (ii) incremental business development expenses of 170,461 and (iii) insurance costs, which increased by 123,938. Bulk Segment: The bulk segment contributed 8,393,729 and 7,677,362 to our income from operations for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Bulk segment revenue was 32,991,066 and 26,800,869 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in bulk segment revenue from 2021 to 2022 is attributable to an increase in energy costs for CW-Bahamas, which increased the energy pass-through component of CW-Bahamas rates. Gross profit for the bulk segment was 9,958,854 (30 of bulk segment revenue) and 9,041,597 (34 of bulk segment revenue) for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross profit in dollars increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 principally due to the increase in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021 principally due to incremental repairs and maintenance expenses for CW-Bahamas of approximately 361,000 and incremental chemical costs of approximately 554,000 arising from higher chemical prices and greater chemicals usage. Bulk segment G A expenses increased to 1,570,732 for 2022 as compared to 1,365,735 for 2021 primarily due to relatively small increases in a variety of expense categories. Services Segment: The services segment contributed 2,424,217 and 414,394 to our income from operations for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Services segment revenue increased to 28,835,428 for 2022 compared to 13,884,857 for 2021 due to increases in both plant design and construction revenue and operating and maintenance revenue, with most of the revenue increase resulting from PERC s progress on its contract with Liberty Utilities for the construction of a water treatment plant in Goodyear, Arizona which commenced in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue recognized on this contract in 2022 was approximately 9.5 million.

 The gross profit for the services segment was 5,861,794 (20 of services segment revenue) in 2022 as compared to 3,177,614 (23 of services revenue) for 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars results from the increased revenue. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from 2021 to 2022 results from the relatively lower gross profit percentage earned on PERC s contract with Liberty Utilities compared to that earned from PERC s operating and maintenance contracts. G A expenses for the services segment increased to 3,461,294 for 2022 as compared to 2,762,735 for 2021 as a result of increased bonus accruals of 235,204 arising from the improved financial performance of PERC, 385,156 in incremental other employee costs attributable to salary increases and new hires and increased insurance expense. Manufacturing Segment: The manufacturing segment incurred a loss from operations of 358,748) for 2022 as compared to a loss of 4,036,666) for 2021. The loss from operations for 2021 reflects an impairment loss recorded for our manufacturing segment s goodwill of 2,900,000 due to a decline in Aerex s projected future cash flows. Manufacturing segment revenue was 6,324,465 and 4,072,823 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Manufacturing segment revenue increased from 2021 to 2022 due to an increase in production activity that resulted from an easing of some of the supply change difficulties that restricted production for 2021 and most of 2022. Manufacturing segment gross profit was 1,129,225 (18 of manufacturing segment revenue) and 243,964 (6 of manufacturing segment revenue) for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in manufacturing segment gross profit in dollars reflects the increased revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased due to the revenue increase and the resulting lesser relative impact of fixed factory overhead on this measure, as we elected to continue the employment of all of our highly skilled manufacturing personnel during 2022 and 2021 despite the decrease in production activity. G A expenses for the manufacturing segment remained relatively consisted at 1,485,342 for 2022 as compared to 1,380,630 for 2021. The results of our manufacturing segment have been adversely affected by current economic conditions including, but not limited to, increasing raw materials prices, rising human resources costs, tight labor markets, and extended and unexpected delays in the procurement and delivery of raw materials. We believe these economic conditions have also resulted in product order delays from Aerex s existing and prospective customers. The current economic conditions could continue (or further deteriorate) and therefore could continue to adversely impact the future results of our manufacturing segment. FINANCIAL CONDITION The significant changes in the components of our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 (other than the change in our cash and cash equivalents, which is discussed later in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and the reasons for these changes are discussed in the following paragraphs. Current inventory increased by approximately 3.2 million primarily due to an increase in Aerex s inventory, as Aerex began a major new contract in the fourth quarter of 2022. Some of Aerex s manufacturing contracts have also been delayed, resulting in extended retention times for various inventory items purchased for these contracts. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by approximately 3.1 million primarily due to advance payments to contractors and suppliers and the cost of PERC s construction bond for the Liberty Utilities project. Contract assets increased by approximately 2.4 million due to an increase in the Red Gate plant construction and Aerex s manufacturing activities. Construction in progress increased by approximately 3.0 million due to construction activity for Cayman Water s replacement of its West Bay desalination plant.

Table of Contents 
 Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities increased by approximately 5.6 million primarily due to an increase in subcontractor costs for PERC s contract with Liberty Utilities and Aerex s manufacturing projects. Contract liabilities increased by 8.3 million primarily due to approximately 7.0 million in billings made by the services segment in connection with PERC s new contract with Liberty Utilities. Aerex also had an increase of approximately 1.3 million in billings in the manufacturing segment. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Certain transfers from our Bahamas bank accounts to our bank accounts in other countries require the approval of the Central Bank of The Bahamas. The Cayman Islands does not have a tax treaty with the United States. Consequently, should we be required (or elect) to transfer any profits generated by our U.S. operations to our parent company in the Cayman Islands, the amount of any such profits transferred would be subject to a 30 withholding tax. Liquidity Position Our projected liquidity requirements for 2023 include capital expenditures for our existing operations of approximately 14.1 million, which includes 2.8 million to be incurred in 2023 for the replacement of the West Bay seawater desalination plant and approximately 7.5 million for construction of the WAC s new Red Gate plant. We paid approximately 1.4 million for dividends in January 2023. Our liquidity requirements may also include future quarterly dividends, if such dividends are declared by our Board. On January 4, 2023, we purchased the remaining 39 of PERC from its minority shareholders for approximately 2.44 million in cash and 368,383 shares of the Company s common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 50.7 million and working capital of 69.9 million. With the exception of the liquidity matter relating to CW-Bahamas that is discussed in the paragraphs that follow, we are not presently aware of anything that would lead us to believe that we will not have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs. CW-Bahamas Liquidity CW-Bahamas accounts receivable balance (which include accrued interest) due from the WSC amounted to 16.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Approximately 65 of the December 31, 2022 accounts receivable balance was delinquent as of that date. The delay in collecting these accounts receivable has adversely impacted the liquidity of this subsidiary. From time to time, CW-Bahamas has experienced delays in collecting its accounts receivable from the WSC. When these delays occur, we hold discussions and meetings with representatives of the WSC and The Bahamas government, and as a result, payment schedules are developed for WSC s delinquent accounts receivable. All previous delinquent accounts receivable from the WSC, including accrued interest thereon, were eventually paid in full. Based upon this payment history, CW-Bahamas has never been required to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for any of its accounts receivable, despite the periodic accumulation of significant delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2022, we have not provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for CW-Bahamas accounts receivable from the WSC. In February 2022, we received correspondence from the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Bahamas that stated that the Government intends to return all of CW-Bahamas accounts receivable from the WSC to current status. In its latest report dated October 6, 2022, Moody s Investor Services Moody s downgraded the Government of The Bahamas long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B1 from Ba3. Moody s also lowered The Bahamas local currency ceiling to Baa3 from Baa2 and its foreign currency ceiling to Ba1 from Baa3. Based upon our review of this Moody s report, we continue to believe no allowance for doubtful accounts is required for CW-Bahamas accounts receivable from the WSC.

 Discussion of Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Our cash and cash equivalents increased to 50,711,751 as of December 31, 2022 from 40,358,059 as of December 31, 2021. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by our operating activities was 21,331,805. This net cash provided reflects net income generated for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 6,969,207 as adjusted for (i) various items included in the determination of net income that do not affect cash flows during the year; and (ii) changes in the other components of working capital. The more significant of such items and changes in working capital components included depreciation and amortization of 6,187,308, an increase in contract liabilities of 8,290,043, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 6,756,433, an increase in inventory of 3,387,011, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 3,365,747 and an increase in contract assets of 2,423,761. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used by our investing activities was 4,981,036. Cash used was primarily for additions to property, plant and equipment and construction in progress of 7,542,761. We did not renew our CW-Bahamas 2.5 million certificate of deposit at year-end. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used by our financing activities was 6,304,873, almost all of which related to the payment of dividends. Material Commitments, Expenditures and Contingencies Cayman Water Retail License We sell water through our retail operations under a license issued in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government (the 1990 license that granted Cayman Water the exclusive right to provide potable water to customers within its licensed service area. Although the 1990 license was not expressly extended after January 2018, we continue to supply water under the terms of the 1990 license, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Pursuant to the 1990 license, Cayman Water has the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to its licensed service area, which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman Island: Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. In 2022 and 2021, we generated approximately 27 and 33 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue and 44 and 47 , respectively, of our consolidated gross profit from the retail water operations conducted under the 1990 license. The 1990 license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent express extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to operate under the terms of the 1990 license, providing water services to the level and quality specified in the 1990 license and in accordance with our understanding of its legal obligations, treating those obligations set forth in the 1990 license as operative notwithstanding the expiration of the express extension. We continue to pay the royalty of 7.5 of revenue we collect required under the 1990 license. In October 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office OfReg ). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands in April 2017, which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the retail license negotiations from the WAC to OfReg in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg in July 2017 and such negotiations are continuing. We have been informed during our retail license negotiations, both by OfReg and its predecessor in these negotiations, that the Cayman Islands

 government seeks to restructure the terms of our license in a manner that could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license. The Cayman Islands government could seek to grant a third party a license to service some or all of Cayman Water s present service area. However, as set forth in the 1990 license, the Governor hereby agrees that upon the expiry of the term of this Licence or any extension thereof, he will not grant a licence or franchise to any other person or company for the processing, distribution, sale and supply of water within the Licence Area without having first offered such a licence or franchise to the Company on terms no less favourable than the terms offered to such other person or company. We are presently unable to determine what impact the resolution of our retail license negotiations will have on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations but such resolution could result in a material reduction (or the loss) of the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail operations and could require us to record impairment losses to reduce the carrying value of our retail segment assets. Such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operation and cash flows . CW-Bahamas Performance Guarantees Our contracts to supply water to the WSC from our Blue Hills and Windsor plants require us to guarantee delivery of a minimum quantity of water per week. If the WSC requires the water and we do not meet this minimum, we are required to pay the WSC for the difference between the minimum and actual gallons delivered at a per gallon rate equal to the price per gallon that WSC is currently paying us under the contract. The Blue Hills contract expires in 2032 and requires us to deliver 63.0 million gallons of water each week. The Windsor contract expires in 2033 and requires us to deliver 16.8 million gallons of water each week. Adoption of new accounting standards None. Effect of newly issued but not yet effective accounting standards None. Dividends On January 31, 2022, we paid a dividend of 0.085 to shareholders of record on January 3, 2022. On April 29, 2022, we paid a dividend of 0.085 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2022. On July 29, 2022, we paid a dividend of 0.085 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2022. On October 31, 2022, we paid a dividend of 0.085 to shareholders of record on October 3, 2022 . On January 31, 2023, we paid a dividend of 0.085 to shareholders of record on January 3, 2023. On February 21, 2023, our Board declared a dividend of 0.085 payable on April 28, 2023 to shareholders of record on April 3, 2023. We have paid dividends to owners of our common stock and redeemable preferred stock since we began declaring dividends in 1985. Our payment of any future cash dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant in determining the amount and timing of such dividends. Dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan This plan is available to our shareholders, who may reinvest all or a portion of their common stock dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices and may also invest optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at prevailing market prices as part of this plan.

 Impact of inflation Under the terms of our Cayman Islands license and our water sales agreements in The Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands, our water rates are automatically adjusted for inflation on an annual basis. Therefore, the impact of inflation on our gross profit, measured in consistent dollars, historically has not been material. However, we have not increased our retail water rates since January 2018 (despite the inflation that has occurred since that date) due to the lack of a resolution of our negotiations with OfReg for a new retail license. This lack of a rate increase has contributed to a decline in the gross profit generated by our retail segment. Furthermore, our manufacturing segment has been adversely impacted by recent significant increases in raw material costs and our services segment could suffer similar adverse impacts in the future. Should the current inflationary trend continue, our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In general, our operating and maintenance contracts are adjusted annually for the impacts of inflation. Increases in fuel and energy costs and other items could create additional credit risks for us, as our customers ability to pay our invoices could be adversely affected by such increases. ITEM 7A.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet s of Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of Goodwill for the Manufacturing Reporting Unit As of December 31, 2022, the Manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill balance was 1,985,211. Management s goodwill impairment assessment for the Manufacturing reporting unit involves subjective management assumptions. These assumptions are forward-looking and are effected by shifts in the evolving market landscape. Changes in these assumptions can have a material effect on the determination of the fair value of this reporting unit. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the Manufacturing reporting unit, performing 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future operating results required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. The Company estimated the fair value of the Manufacturing reporting unit by applying the discounted cash flow method, which relied upon seven-year discrete projections of operating results, working capital and capital expenditures, along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period. The seven-year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, and considered the impact of planned business and operational strategies. The discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of the analysis. The Company also estimated the fair value of the Manufacturing reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022 by applying the guideline public company method. The Company weighted the fair values estimated for the Manufacturing reporting unit under each method and summed such weighted fair values to estimate the overall fair value for the reporting unit. The respective weightings applied to each method for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 80 to the discounted cash flow method and 20 to the guideline public company method. Our primary audit procedures to test management s goodwill impairment evaluation for the manufacturing reporting unit included the following: We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of the Company s internal controls over management s annual goodwill impairment assessment, including controls addressing: o Management s assessment of potential triggering events indicating potential impairment. o Management s annual goodwill assessment and controls surrounding their qualitative and quantitative assessments. We obtained the Company s ASC 350 Goodwill impairment analysis memo and supporting workbook for the Manufacturing segment prepared by the Company s management which includes their goodwill evaluation and discounted cash flow model. We substantively tested the appropriateness of the prospective financial information and assumptions included in the valuation model associated with the projected balance sheets, income statements, capital expenditures, effective tax rates, and growth rates of the out years for contradictions to market factors and information, historical experiences, economic conditions, and the Company s objectives and business risks. In assessing the prospective financial information, we evaluated the reasonableness of management s revenue and operating projections included in their discounted cash flow model through testing of the Company s contract backlogs and through performing a retrospective review comparing actual historical operations to projections. We obtained the Company s ASC 350 Goodwill impairment analysis report for the Manufacturing segment prepared by the Company s specialist and assessed the appropriateness and reasonableness of valuation methodologies, discount rates, and assumptions used. We traced all relevant financial data from the valuation workbook noted above to the inputs that were used in the goodwill valuation report to ensure the Company s projections were properly incorporated into the valuation model. We utilized our valuation specialist to verify that the valuation methodology used by the Company was appropriate. Our valuation specialist tested the clerical accuracy of the valuation model and reperformed the calculation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using the methodologies in the valuation report to verify the Company s calculation of fair value is reasonable. We compared our calculation to the carrying value of the company as of December 31, 2022 noting that there is no impairment.

 to the discounted cash flow method and to the guideline public company method. The fair values the Company estimated for its Cayman Water, bulk segment, PERC, and manufacturing segment reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by , , and respectively, as of December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment testing conducted in prior years for all goodwill reporting units other than the manufacturing reporting unit. The Company assessed relevant events and circumstances to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units are less than their carrying values. The events and circumstances assessed for each unit included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant events. Based upon this qualitative assessment the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of its Cayman Water and bulk segment reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2022. Based upon the Company s negotiated, arms-length purchase of the remaining equity interest in PERC from its minority shareholders for million in January 2023, the fair value of the Company s PERC reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 79 as of December 31, 2022. Due to the factors discussed in the following paragraphs, the Company elected to test the goodwill associated with its manufacturing reporting unit for possible impairment using the quantitative tests applied in prior years. In connection with its acquisition of Aerex in 2016, the Company recorded goodwill of . Aerex s actual results of operations for 2016 fell significantly short of the projected results that were included in the cash flow projections the Company utilized to determine the purchase price for Aerex and the fair values of its assets and liabilities. Due to this shortfall in Aerex s results of operations, the Company tested its manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment and recorded an impairment loss of in 2016. As part of its annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter, in 2017 the Company updated its projections for Aerex s future cash flows, determined that the carrying value of its manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and recorded an impairment loss of for December 31, 2017 to further reduce the carrying value of the manufacturing segment goodwill to . Approximately of Aerex s revenue, and of Aerex s gross profit, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated from sales to customer. While Aerex sells various products to this customer, Aerex s revenue from this customer has historically been derived primarily from one specialized product. In October 2020, this customer informed Aerex that, for inventory management purposes, it was suspending its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex following 2020 for a period of approximately one year. This customer informed Aerex at that time that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex beginning with the first quarter of 2022. As a result of this anticipated loss of revenue for Aerex, the Company updated its projections for its Manufacturing reporting unit s future cash flows. Such projections assumed, in part, that Aerex s major customer would recommence its purchases from Aerex in 2022 but at a reduced aggregate amount, as compared to 2020. Based upon these updated projections, the Company tested its manufacturing reporting unit s goodwill for possible impairment as of December 31, 2020 using the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods, with a weighting of and applied to these two methods, respectively. As a result of these impairment tests, the Company determined that the estimated fair value of its manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately as of December 31, 2020. In late July 2021, this former major customer communicated to Aerex that it expected to recommence its purchases of the specialized product from Aerex in 2022 and subsequent years, but informed Aerex that such purchases would be at substantially reduced annual amounts, as compared to the amounts it had purchased from Aerex in 2020 and prior years. The Company s updated sales estimate for this customer based on this new information was substantially below the anticipated sales to this customer for 2022 and subsequent years that the Company used in the discounted cash flow

 and applied to these two methods, respectively. Based upon this testing, the Company determined that the carrying value of its manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its fair value by million, and the Company recorded an impairment loss to reduce its manufacturing segment s goodwill by this amount for the three months ended June 30, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of its manufacturing reporting unit by applying the discounted cash flow method, which relied upon seven-year discrete projections of operating results, working capital and capital expenditures, along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period. These seven-year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, and considered the impact of planned business and operational strategies. The discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of each analysis. The Company also estimated the fair value of its manufacturing reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022 by applying the guideline public company method. The Company weighted the fair values estimated for its manufacturing reporting unit under each method and summed such weighted fair values to estimate the overall fair value for the reporting unit. The respective weightings the Company applied to each method for the year ended December 31, 2022 were to the discounted cash flow method and to the guideline public company method. The fair value the Company estimated for its manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes the inherent uncertainties associated with the accounting estimates and assumptions it uses for its estimates of its manufacturing reporting unit s fair value have increased due to the current, less predictable economic conditions, which have resulted in increasing raw material prices, extended and unexpected delays in the procurement and delivery of its raw materials, and have also, the Company believes, adversely affected its customers. Should interest rates rise significantly in the future the Company would likely be required to increase the discount rate it uses under the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit, and such increased discount rate in and of itself could decrease the estimated fair value of the manufacturing reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method. As noted previously, based upon its estimation prepared as of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Company s manufacturing reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by . However, if the Company determines in the future that Aerex s discounted future cash inflows will be less than its present expectations, the Company may be required to record additional impairment losses to reduce the remaining carrying values of its manufacturing segment s goodwill and its remaining unamortized intangible assets balances, which amounted to and , respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Any such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations. The Company recognizes impairment losses on declines in the fair value of the stock of investees that are other than temporary.

 million gallons, a requirement CW-Bahamas met during 2007. The Company was solely responsible for the engineering, labor and materials costs incurred to reduce the amount of lost water, which were capitalized and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the original remaining life of the Blue Hills contract. Such costs are included in other assets and aggregated approximately million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accumulated amortization for these costs was approximately million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for these costs was for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Bulk revenue Services revenue Manufacturing revenue Total revenue Retail revenue The Company produces and supplies water to end-users, including residential, commercial and governmental customers in the Cayman Islands under an exclusive retail license issued to Cayman Water by the Cayman Islands government to provide water in two of the three most populated areas on Grand Cayman Island. Customers are billed on a monthly basis based on metered consumption and bills are typically collected within to 45 days after the billing date. Receivables not collected within days subject the customer to disconnection from water service. The Company recognizes revenue from water sales at the time water is supplied to the customer s premises. The amount of water supplied is determined and invoiced based upon water meter readings performed at the end of each month. All retail water contracts are month-to-month contracts. The Company has elected the right to invoice practical expedient for revenue recognition on its retail water sale contracts and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. Bulk revenue The Company produces and supplies water to government-owned utilities in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas. OC-Cayman provides bulk water to the Water Authority-Cayman WAC ), a government-owned utility and regulatory agency, under two agreements. The WAC in turn distributes such water to properties in Grand Cayman outside of Cayman Water s retail license area.

NSC initially owned of the equity of AdR. In February 2018, CW-Holdings acquired the remaining ownership in AdR from NuWater. On August 22, 2016, the Public Private Partnership Agreement for the Project (the APP Contract was executed between AdR, the State Water Commission of Baja California CEA ), the Government of Baja California, as represented by the Secretary of Planning and Finance and the Public Utilities Commission of Tijuana CESPT ). The APP Contract required AdR to design, construct, finance and operate a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant (and accompanying aqueduct) with a capacity of up to million gallons per day in two phases: the first with a capacity of million gallons per day and an aqueduct to the Mexican public water system in Tijuana, Baja California and the second phase with a capacity of million gallons per day. The first phase was to be operational within of commencing construction and the

 starting from the commencement of operation of the first phase. At the end of the operating period, the plant and aqueduct would have been transferred to CEA. The APP Contract was subsequently amended by the parties in June 2018 to increase the scope of Phase 1 and to allow for changes in the water tariff due to the changes in the exchange rate for the peso, interest rates and construction costs that had and would occur from the date the APP Contract was signed to the date construction commenced. On June 29, 2020, AdR received a letter (the Letter from the Director General of CEA and the Director General of CESPT terminating the APP Contract. The Letter requested that AdR provide an inventory of the assets that currently comprise the Project Works (as defined in the APP Contract) for the purpose of acknowledging and paying the non-recoverable expenses made by AdR in connection with the Project, with such reimbursement to be calculated in accordance with the terms of the APP Contract. The applicable law required that this list of non-recoverable expenses made by AdR in connection with the Project be submitted to CEA and CESPT within business days from the date of receipt of the Letter. AdR initiated an amparo claim before a federal district court in Tijuana, Baja California, to challenge the provision of the applicable law requiring submittal of the list of non-recoverable expenses within the 20 business days term, as AdR considered such term to be unreasonably short due to the magnitude of the Project and the scope of supporting documentation required to be provided with respect to the non-recoverable expenses. AdR obtained an initial provisional suspension of the lapsing of such 20-day term from the court, and on August 10, 2020 the court made such suspension definitive until the completion of the amparo trial. As such, the 20-day term for filing the list of non-recoverable expenses was suspended. Therefore, on August 28, 2020, AdR submitted their list of non-recoverable expenses, including those of NSC, to CEA and CESPT which was comprised of United States dollars and an additional Mexican pesos. In February 2021, AdR withdrew this amparo claim, and such withdrawal was accepted by the federal district court in Tijuana. To date, AdR has not received a formal response from CEA or CESPT to its submission of non-recoverable expenses. The Company believes CW-Cooperatief, as a Netherlands company, has certain rights relating to its investments in NSC and AdR under the Agreement on Promotion, Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Mexican States entered into force as of October 1, 1999 (the Treaty ). On April 16, 2021, CW-Cooperatief submitted a letter to the President of Mexico and other Mexican federal government officials alleging that the State s termination of the APP Contract constituted a breach by Mexico of its international obligations under the Treaty, entitling CW-Cooperatief to full reparation, including monetary damages. This letter invites Mexico to seek a resolution of this investment dispute through consultation and negotiation, but stated that if the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner, CW-Cooperatief elects to refer the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of International Disputes for arbitration, as provided for in the Treaty. On June 29, 2021, the Mexican Ministry of Economy responded to CW-Cooperatief s letter and proposed to hold a consultation meeting. Two such meetings were held on July 9, 2021 and August 2, 2021 on a confidential basis, without a resolution of the Company s investment dispute. On February 9, 2022, CW-Cooperatief, filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of International Disputes requesting that the United Mexican States pay CW-Cooperatief damages in excess of US million plus MXN million (with the exact amount to be quantified in the proceedings), plus fees, costs and pre- and post-award interest. CW-Cooperatief intends to pursue vigorously the relief sought in the arbitration, in addition to pursuing all other legal remedies and courses of action available under the operative contracts and applicable law with respect to their rights, damages, fees and expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurances that CW-Cooperatief will be able to obtain the relief sought in the arbitration, and CW-Cooperatief will incur legal and other arbitration-related expenses that the Company expects will be material to its consolidated results of operations and cash flows. During July 2022, the State initiated discussions with the Company to potentially resolve the issues related to the cancellation by the government of the Rosarito desalination plant contract as well as potentially addressing the State s acute water shortage issues. The Company cannot presently determine the outcome of the discussions and the Company has not terminated its efforts to obtain relief through the international arbitration process as a result of these discussions.

If these options are exercised, the shares of preferred stock obtained may also be converted to shares of common stock if the employee remains with the Company through the fourth anniversary of a grant date. Each employee s option to purchase shares of preferred stock must be exercised within 30 days of the grant date, which is the 90 th day after the date of the independent registered public accountants audit opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Employee Share Option Plan (Common Stock Options) The Company has an employee stock option plan for four long-serving employees of the Company. Under the plan, these employees are granted in each calendar year, as long as the employee is a participant in the Employee Share Incentive Plan, options to purchase common shares. The price at which the option may be exercised is the closing market price on the grant date, which is the 40 th day after the date of the Company s Annual Shareholder Meeting. The number of options each employee is granted is equal to five times the sum of (i) the number of shares of preferred stock that employee receives for nil consideration and (ii) the number of preferred stock options that employee exercises in that given year.

Options granted under this plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled and , respectively. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company s common stock. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within its valuation model. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan On May 14, 2008, the Company s stockholders approved the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan and reserved shares of the Company s Class A common shares for issuance under this plan.

When these delays occur, the Company holds discussions and meetings with representatives of the WSC and The Bahamas government, and as a result, payment schedules are developed for WSC s delinquent accounts receivable.

The ordinary shares (common stock) are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CWCO. All outstanding ordinary shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. Ordinary Shares Voting Rights Holders of ordinary shares may cast one vote for each share held of record at all shareholder meetings. All voting is non-cumulative. Holders of more than 50 of the outstanding shares present and voting at an annual meeting at which a quorum is present are able to elect all of our directors. Dividends and Liquidation Rights Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive ratably dividends, if any, distributed out of our accumulated profits. Subject to the preferential rights of holders of the redeemable preference shares, upon liquidation, all holders of ordinary shares are entitled to participate pro rata in our assets which are available for distribution. Other Rights Holders of ordinary shares do not have preemptive rights or rights to convert their ordinary shares into any other securities, and our common stock is not subject to any redemption or sinking fund provisions. Redeemable Preference Shares Voting Holders of redeemable preference shares may cast one vote for each share held of record at all shareholder meetings. All voting is on a non-cumulative basis. Dividends and Liquidation Rights Upon the event of our liquidation, the redeemable preference shares rank in preference to the ordinary shares with respect to the repayment of the par value of redeemable preference shares plus any premium paid or credited on the purchase of the shares. Other Rights Under our employee share incentive plan, we may redeem any redeemable preference shares issued to an employee under certain circumstances. The ordinary shares and the redeemable preference shares rank equally in all other respects. 

 Class B Ordinary Shares Special Rights Holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to the same dividends paid on Class A ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares, and we cannot pay a dividend on the Class A ordinary shares without paying the same dividend on the Class B ordinary shares, and vice versa. We cannot redeem the Class B ordinary shares, and the holders of the Class B ordinary shares are not entitled to any repayments of capital upon our dissolution. If we enter into a transaction in which Class A ordinary shares are exchanged for securities or other consideration of another company, then the Class B ordinary shares will also be exchanged pursuant to a formula.
