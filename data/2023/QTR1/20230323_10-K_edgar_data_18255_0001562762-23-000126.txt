 PART 
I 
 Item 1. 

 Business: 
 Background 
 
The 
Company, 
founded 
in 
1946, 
operated 
1,280 
fashion 
specialty 
stores 
at 
January 
28, 
2023, 
in 
32 
 states, 
principally 
in 
the 
southeastern 
United 
States, 
under 
the 
names 
 Cato, 
 Cato 
Fashions, 
 Cato 
 Plus, 
 It s 
Fashion, 
 It s 
Fashion 
Metro 
and 
 Versona. 
The 
Cato 
concept 
seeks 
to 
offer 
quality 
 fashion 
apparel 
and 
accessories 
at 
low 
prices 
every 
day, 
in 
junior/missy 
and 
plus 
sizes. 
The 
Cato 
 concept s stores and e-commerce website feature a broad assortment of apparel and accessories, including 
 dressy, 
career, 
and 
casual 
sportswear, 
dresses, 
coats, 
shoes, 
lingerie, 
costume 
jewelry 
and 
handbags. 
A 
 major portion of the Cato concept s 
merchandise is sold under its private label and is produced by various 
 vendors 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
concept s 
specifications. 
The 
It s 
Fashion 
and 
It s 
Fashion 
Metro 
 concepts offer fashion with a focus on the latest trendy styles for the entire family at low prices every day. 

 The 
Versona 
concept s 
stores 
and 
e-commerce website 
offer 
quality fashion 
apparel items, 
jewelry 
and 
 accessories at 
exceptional values 
every day. 
The 
Company s 
stores 
range in 
size from 
2,200 to 
19,000 
 square 
feet 
and 
are 
located 
primarily 
in 
strip 
shopping 
centers 
anchored 
by 
national 
discounters 
or

The 
Company 
emphasizes

and 
coordinated 
 merchandise 
presentations 
in 
an 
appealing 
store 
environment. 
The 
Company 
offers 
its

See 
Note 
13 
to 
the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements, Reportable 
Segment 
Information, 
 for a discussion of information regarding the Company s two reportable segments: retail and credit. 

The 
Company 
has 
operated 
Cato-branded 
retail 
stores 
for 
approximately 
76 
years. 
The 
Company 
 originated as a family-owned business and 
made its first initial public offering 
of stock in 1968. 
In 1980, 
 the Company went private and in 1987 again conducted an initial public 
offering. 
 Business Strategy 
 
The Company s 
primary objective 
is to 
be the 
leading fashion 
specialty retailer 
for fashion 
and value 
 in its 
markets. Management believes the 
Company s success 
is dependent upon 
its ability to 
differentiate 
 its stores 
from department 
stores, mass 
merchandise discount 
stores and 
competing specialty 
stores. The 
 key elements of the Company s business strategy are: 

Merchandise 
Assortment.
 
The 
Company s 
stores 
offer 
a 
wide 
assortment 
of 
on-trend 
apparel 
and 
 accessory items in primarily junior/missy, 
plus sizes, men and kids sizes, toddler to 
boys size 20 and girls 
 size 16 with 
an emphasis on color, 
product coordination and selection. 
Colors and styles are 
coordinated 
 and presented so that outfit selection is easily made. 

Value 
Pricing.
 
The 
Company offers 
quality 
merchandise that 
is 
generally priced 
below comparable 
 merchandise 
offered 
by 
department 
stores 
and 
mall 
specialty 
apparel 
chains, 
but 
is 
generally 
more 
 fashionable 
than 
merchandise 
offered 
by 
discount 
stores. 
Management 
believes 
that 
the 
Company 
has 
 positioned itself as the every day low price leader in its market 
segment. 

Strip 
Shopping 
Center 
Locations. 
 The 
Company 
locates 
its 
stores 
principally 
in 
convenient 
strip 
 centers anchored by 
national discounters or 
market-dominant grocery stores 
that attract large 
numbers of 
 potential customers. 

Customer Service.
 
Store managers 
and sales 
associates are 
trained 
to 
provide prompt 
and courteous 
 service and to assist customers in merchandise selection and wardrobe 
coordination. 

Credit and 
Layaway Programs
 . 
The Company offers 
its own credit 
card and a 
layaway plan to 
make 
 the purchase of its merchandise more convenient for its customers.

 Merchandising 

Merchandising 
 
The 
Company 
seeks 
to 
offer 
a 
broad 
selection 
of 
high 
quality 
and 
exceptional 
value 
apparel 
and 
 accessories 
to 
suit 
the 
various 
lifestyles 
of 
fashion 
and 
value-conscious 
customers. 
In 
addition, 
the 
 Company strives to offer on-trend fashion in exciting colors with consistent fit and 
quality. 
 
The Company s merchandise lines 
include dressy, career, 
and casual sportswear, dresses, 
coats, shoes, 
 lingerie, costume 
jewelry, 
handbags, men s 
wear and 
lines for 
kids and 
infants. The 
Company primarily 
 offers exclusive 
merchandise with 
fashion and 
quality comparable 
to mall 
specialty stores 
at low 
prices, 
 every day. 
 
The Company believes that the collaboration of its merchandising and design teams with an expanded 
 in-house 
product 
development 
and 
direct 
sourcing 
function 
has 
enhanced 
merchandise 
offerings 
and 
 delivers quality, 
exclusive on-trend 
styles at 
lower prices. 
The product 
development and 
direct sourcing 
 operations provide 
research on 
emerging fashion 
and color 
trends, technical 
services and 
direct sourcing 
 options. 
 
As a 
part of 
its merchandising 
strategy, 
members of 
the Company s 
merchandising and 
design staff 
 visit selected 
stores to 
monitor the 
merchandise offerings 
of other 
retailers, regularly 
communicate with 
 store operations 
associates and frequently 
confer with 
key vendors. 
The Company 
also takes 
aggressive 
 markdowns 
on 
slow-selling 
merchandise 
and 
typically 
does 
not 
carry 
over 
merchandise 
to 
the 
next

Although 
the 
Company 
purchases 
merchandise 
from 
approximately 
580 
suppliers, 
most 
of 
its 
 merchandise is 
purchased from 
approximately 100 
primary vendors. 
In 
fiscal 
2022, 
purchases from 
the 
 Company s 
largest 
vendor 
accounted 
for 
approximately 
16 
of 
the 
Company s 
total 
purchases. 
The 
 Company is 
not dependent 
on its 
largest vendor 
or any 
other vendor 
for merchandise 
purchases, and 
the 
 loss of any single vendor or group of 
vendors would not have a material adverse effect on 
the Company s 
 operating results or financial condition. A substantial portion of the Company s merchandise is sold under 
 its 
private 
labels 
and 
is 
produced 
by 
various 
vendors 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Company s 
strict 
 specifications. The Company sources a majority of its 
merchandise directly from manufacturers overseas, 
 primarily in 
Southeast Asia. 
These manufacturers 
are dependent 
on materials 
that are 
primarily sourced 
 from 
China. The 
Company purchases 
its 
remaining merchandise 
from 
domestic importers 
and 
vendors, 
 which typically 
minimizes the 
time necessary to 
purchase and 
obtain shipments; however, 
these vendors 
 are 
dependent 
on 
materials 
primarily 
sourced 
from 
China. 
The 
Company 
opened 
its 
own 
overseas 
 sourcing operations in the fall of 2014, replacing the Company s former sourcing agent in 2015. Although 
 a 
significant 
portion 
of 
the 
Company s 
merchandise 
is 
manufactured 
overseas, 
primarily 
in 
Southeast 
 Asia, the Company does 
not expect that any 
economic, political, public health or 
social unrest in any 
one 
 country 
would 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Company s 
ability 
to 
obtain 
adequate 
supplies 
of 
 merchandise. 
However, 
the 
Company 
can 
give 
no 
assurance 
that 
any 
changes 
or 
disruptions 
in 
its 
 merchandise supply 
chain would 
not materially 
and adversely 
affect the 
Company. 
See Risk 
Factors 
 Risks 
Relating To 
Our 
Business 
Because 
we 
source a 
significant 
portion of 
our 
merchandise directly 
 and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks that 
 affect 
the 
prevailing 
social, 
economic, 
political, 
public 
health 
and 
other 
conditions 
in 
the 
areas 
from 
 which 
we 
source 
merchandise; 
changes, 
disruptions, 
cost 
changes 
or 
other 
problems 
affecting 
the 
 Company s 
merchandise 
supply 
chain 
have 
and 
could 
continue 
to 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
the 
 Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

An 
important 
component 
of 
the 
Company s 
strategy 
is 
the 
allocation 
of 
merchandise 
to 
individual 
 stores 
based 
on 
an 
analysis 
of 
sales 
trends 
by 
merchandise 
category, 
customer 
profiles 
and 
climatic 
 conditions. 
A 
merchandise 
control 
system 
provides 
current 
information 
on 
the 
sales 
activity 
of 
each 

7
 merchandise 
style 
in 
each 
of 
the 
Company s 
stores. 
Point-of-sale 
terminals 
in 
the 
stores 
collect 
and 
 transmit sales and inventory information to the Company s central database, permitting timely response to 
 sales trends on a store-by-store basis. 
 
All merchandise is shipped directly to the Company s distribution 
center in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
 where it 
is inspected 
and then 
allocated by 
the merchandise 
distribution staff 
for shipment 
to individual 
 stores. The flow 
of merchandise from 
receipt at 
the distribution center 
to shipment to 
stores is controlled 
 by 
an 
online 
system. 
Shipments 
are 
made 
by 
common 
carrier, 
and 
each 
store 
receives 
at 
least 
one 
 shipment per 
week. 
The centralization 
of the 
Company s 
distribution process 
also subjects 
it to 
risks in 
 the 
event 
of 
damage 
to 
or 
destruction 
of 
its 
distribution 
facility 
or 
other 
disruptions 
affecting 
the 
 distribution 
center 
or 
the 
flow 
of 
goods 
into 
or 
out 
of 
Charlotte, 
North 
Carolina. 
See

To 
Our Information 
Technology 
and Related 
Systems 
A disruption 
or shutdown 
of our 
 centralized 
distribution 
center 
or 
transportation 
network 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 business and results of operations. 
 
Advertising 
 
The 
Company 
uses 
television, 
in-store 
signage, 
graphics, 
a 
Company 
website, 
two 
e-commerce 
 websites 
and 
social 
media 
as 
its 
primary 
advertising 
media. 
The 
Company s 
total 
advertising 
 expenditures 
were 
approximately 
1.0 , 
0.9 
and 
0.8 
of 
retail 
sales 
for 
fiscal 
years 
2022, 
2021 
and 
 2020, respectively. 
 Store Operations 
 
The Company s 
store operations 
management team 
consists of 
four territorial 
managers, 11 
regional 
 managers and 109 district managers. Regional managers receive 
a salary plus a bonus based 
on achieving 
 targeted goals 
for sales 
and payroll. 
District managers 
receive a 
salary plus 
a bonus 
based on 
achieving 
 targeted 
objectives for 
district sales 
increases. Stores 
are typically 
staffed 
with a 
manager, 
two assistant 
 managers 
and 
additional 
part-time 
sales 
associates 
depending 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
store 
and 
seasonal 
 personnel needs. 
In general, 
store managers 
are paid 
a salary 
or on 
an hourly 
basis as 
are all 
other store 
 personnel. 
Store 
managers, 
assistant 
managers 
and 
sales 
associates 
are 
eligible 
for 
monthly 
and 
semi-
 annual bonuses based on achieving targeted goals for their respective store s sales increases. 
 Store Locations 
 
Most 
of 
the 
Company s 
stores 
are 
located 
in 
the 
southeastern 
United 
States in 
a 
variety of 
markets 
 ranging 
from 
small 
towns 
to 
large 
metropolitan 
areas 
with 
trade 
area 
populations 
of 
20,000 
or 
more. 
 Stores average approximately 4,500 square feet in size. 
 
All of the 
Company s stores 
are leased. Approximately 92 are 
located in strip shopping 
centers and 
 8 in enclosed 
shopping malls. The 
Company typically locates stores 
in strip shopping 
centers anchored 
 by 
a 
national 
discounter, 
primarily 
Walmart 
Supercenters, 
or 
market-dominant 
grocery 
stores. 
The 
 Company s strip center locations provide ample parking and shopping convenience for its customers. 
 
The 
Company s 
store 
development 
activities 
consist 
of 
opening 
new 
stores 
in 
new 
and 
existing 
 markets, 
relocating 
selected 
existing 
stores 
to 
more 
desirable 
locations 
in 
the 
same 
market 
area 
and 
 closing underperforming stores. The following table sets forth information

The Company periodically 
reviews its store 
base to determine 
whether any particular 
store should be 
 closed based on its sales 
trends and profitability. 
The Company intends to continue this 
review process to 
 identify underperforming stores. 

 Credit and Layaway 
 
Credit Card Program 
 The Company offers its own credit card, which accounted for 3.1 , 2.5 and 2.7 of retail 
sales in 
 fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company s net bad debt expense was 2.0 , 3.0 and 3.6 
 of credit sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Customers applying for the Company s credit card are approved for credit if 
they have a satisfactory 
 credit 
record 
and 
the 
Company 
has 
considered 
the 
customer s 
ability 
to 
make 
the 
required 
minimum 
 payment. 
Customers are required 
to make minimum 
monthly payments based 
on their account 
balances. 
 If 
the 
balance 
is 
not 
paid 
in 
full 
each 
month, 
the 
Company 
assesses 
the 
customer 
a 
finance 
charge. 
If 
 payments are not received on time, the customer is assessed a late 
fee subject to regulatory limits. 
 The 
Company 
introduced 
its 
loyalty 
program 
in 
October 
2021. 
The 
loyalty 
program 
credits 
the 
 customer points based on their purchases of 
merchandise using the Company s proprietary 
credit card. 

 A 
 point is earned for every dollar spent on merchandise purchases. 

 A 
 5.00 rewards card is earned for every 
 250 
points 
accumulated 
by 
the 
customer. 
The 
rewards 
card 
expires 
90 
days 
after 
the 
rewards 
card 
is 
 issued. 
The fiscal 2022 loyalty program impact is immaterial to the fiscal 2022 financial statements. 
The 
 loyalty 
program 
is 
accounted 
for 
in 
accordance 
with 
ASU 
2014-09, 
 Revenue 
from 
Contracts 
with 
 Customers (Topic 606)
 . 
 
Layaway Plan 
 Under 
the 
Company s 
layaway 
plan, 
merchandise 
is 
set 
aside 
for 
customers 
who 
agree 
to 
make 
 periodic 
payments. 
The 
Company adds 
a 
nonrefundable 
administrative 
fee 
to 
each 
layaway 
sale. 
If 
no 
 payment is made within four weeks, 
the customer is considered to have 
defaulted, and the merchandise is 
 returned 
to 
the 
selling floor 
and again 
offered 
for 
sale, often 
at 
a reduced 
price. All 
payments made 
by 
 customers who subsequently default on their layaway purchase are returned to the customer upon request, 
 less the administrative fee and a restocking fee. 

 The Company defers recognition of layaway sales to the accounting period when the customer picks 
 up 
and 
completely pays 
for 
layaway 
merchandise. 
Administrative fees 
are 
recognized 
in 
the 
period 
in 
 which the 
layaway is 
initiated. 
Recognition of 
restocking fees occurs 
in the 
accounting period 
when the 
 customer 
defaults 
on 
the 
layaway 
purchase. 
Layaway 
sales 
represented 
approximately 
2.7 , 
2.7 
and 
 2.8 of retail sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 
The 
Company s 
information 
technology 
systems 
provide 
daily 
financial 
and 
merchandising 

9
 information 
that 
is 
used 
by 
management to 
enhance 
the 
timeliness 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
purchasing and 
 pricing 
decisions. 
Management 
uses 
a 
daily 
report 
comparing 
actual 
sales 
with 
planned 
sales 
and 
a 
 weekly 
ranking 
report 
to 
monitor 
and 
control 
purchasing 
decisions. 
Weekly 
reports 
are 
also 
produced 
 which reflect 
sales, weeks 
of 
supply of 
inventory and 
other critical 
data by 
product categories, 
by store 
 and by various levels of 
responsibility reporting. Purchases are made based 
on projected sales, but can 
be 
 modified to accommodate unexpected increases or decreases in demand 
for a particular item. 
 
Sales information 
is projected 
by merchandise 
category and, 
in 
some cases, 
is 
further projected 
and 
 actual 
performance measured 
by 
stock 
keeping 
unit 
(SKU). 
Merchandise 
allocation 
models 
are 
used 
to 
 distribute 
merchandise 
to 
individual 
stores 
based 
upon 
historical 
sales 
trends, 
climatic 
differences, 
 customer demographic differences and targeted inventory turnover rates. 
 Competition 
 
The women s 
retail apparel 
industry is 
highly competitive. 
The Company 
believes that 
the principal 
 competitive factors 
in its 
industry include 
merchandise assortment 
and presentation, 
fashion, price, 
store 
 location 
and 
customer 
service. The 
Company competes 
with 
retail 
chains that 
operate similar 
women s 
 apparel specialty stores. In addition, the Company competes with 
mass merchandise chains, discount store 
 chains, major 
department stores, off 
-price retailers 
and internet-based 
retailers. 
Although we 
believe we 
 compete favorably 
with respect 
to the 
principal competitive 
factors described 
above, many 
of our 
direct 
 and 
indirect 
competitors 
are 
well-established 
national, 
regional 
or 
local 
chains, 
and 
some 
have 
 substantially greater 
financial, marketing 
and other 
resources. 
The Company 
expects its 
stores in 
larger 
 cities and metropolitan areas to face more intense competition. 
 Seasonality 
 
Due 
to 
the 
seasonal 
nature 
of 
the 
retail 
business, 
the 
Company 
has 
historically 
experienced 
and 
 expects to continue to 
experience seasonal fluctuations in its 
revenues, operating income and net 
income. 

 Our stores 
typically generate a 
higher percentage of 
our annual 
net sales 
and profitability in 
the first 
and 
 second quarters of 
our fiscal year compared to 
other quarters. 
Results of a 
period shorter than a 
full year 
 may 
not 
be 
indicative 
of 
results 
expected 
for 
the 
entire 
year. 
Furthermore, 
the 
seasonal 
nature 
of 
our 
 business may affect comparisons between periods. 

 Regulation 
 
The 
Company s 
business 
and 
operations 
subject 
it 
to 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
local, 
state, 
national 
and 
 international laws 
and regulations 
in a 
variety of 
areas, including 
but not 
limited to, 
trade, licensing 
and 
 permit 
requirements, 
import 
and 
export 
matters, 
privacy 
and 
data 
protection, 
credit 
regulation, 
 environmental 
matters, 
recordkeeping 
and 
information 
management, 
tariffs, 
taxes, 
intellectual 
property 
 and anti-corruption. 
Though compliance with these laws 
and regulations has not 
had a material effect 
on 
 the capital 
expenditures, results of 
operations or competitive 
position of the 
Company in 
fiscal 2022, the 
 Company faces 
ongoing 
risks 
related 
to 
its 
efforts 
to 
comply with 
these 
laws 
and 
regulations 
and 
risks 
 related 
to 
noncompliance, 
as 
discussed 
generally 
below 
throughout 
the 
 Risk 
Factors 
section 
and 
in 
 particular 
under 
 Risk 
Factors 
 
Risks 
Relating 
to 
Accounting 
and 
Legal 
Matters 
 
Our 
business 
 operations 
subject 
us 
to 
legal 
compliance 
and 
litigation 
risks, 
as 
well 
as 
regulations 
and 
regulatory 
 enforcement 
priorities, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
increased 
costs 
or 
liabilities, 
divert 
our 
management s 
 attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial 
condition. 
 Human Capital 
 
As 
of 
January 
28, 
2023, 
the 
Company 
employed 
approximately 
7,600 
full-time 
and 
part-time 
 associates. The 
Company also 
employs additional 
part-time associates 
during the 
peak retailing 
seasons. 
 The Company s 
full-time team associates are 
engaged 
in various executive, operating, 
and administrative 
 functions in 
the Home 
Office 
and distribution 
center and 
the remainder 
are engaged 
in store 
operations. 
 The Company is 
not a party 
to any 
collective bargaining agreements 
and considers its 
associate relations 

10
 to 
be 
good. 
The 
Company 
offers 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
Company-paid 
benefits 
to 
its 
associates 
including 
 medical and 
dental plans, 
paid vacation, 
a 401(k) 
plan, Employee 
Stock Purchase 
Plan, Employee 
Stock 
 Ownership 
Plan, 
disability 
insurance, 
associate 
assistance 
programs, 
life 
insurance 
and 
an 
associate 
 discount. 
The 
level 
of 
benefits 
and 
eligibility 
vary 
depending 
on 
the 
associate s 
full-time 
or 
part-time 
 status, date 
of hire, 
length of 
service and 
level of 
pay. 
The Company 
endeavors to 
promote diversity, 
to 
 provide 
opportunities 
for 
advancement, 
and 
to 
treat 
all 
of 
its 
associates 
with 
dignity 
and 
respect. 
The 
 Company constantly 
strives 
to 
improve 
its 
training 
programs 
to 
develop 
associates. 
Over 
80 
of 
store 
 and field 
management are promoted from 
within, allowing the 
Company to internally 
staff its 
store base. 
 The 
Company 
has 
training 
programs 
at 
each 
level 
of 
store 
operations. 
The 
Company 
also 
performs 
 ongoing 
reviews 
of 
its 
safety 
protocols, 
including 
measures 
to 
promote 
the 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
its 
 associates. 
 Item 1A. 

 Risk Factors:
 
An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks. 
You 
should carefully consider 
 the 
following 
risk 
factors, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
other 
information 
contained 
in 
this 
report, 
including 
the 
 disclosures 
under 
 Forward-looking 
Information 
above 
in 
evaluating 
our 
Company 
and 
any 
potential 
 investment 
in 
our 
common 
stock. 
If 
any 
of 
the 
following 
risks 
or 
uncertainties 
occur 
or 
persist, 
our 
 business, financial condition and 
operating results could 
be materially and 
adversely affected, the 
trading 
 price 
of 
our 
common 
stock 
could 
decline 
and 
you 
could 
lose 
all 
or 
a 
part 
of 
your 
investment 
in 
our 
 common 
stock. 
The 
risks 
and 
uncertainties 
described 
in 
this 
section 
are 
not 
the 
only 
ones 
facing 
us. 

 Additional risks 
and uncertainties 
not presently 
known to 
us or 
that we 
currently deem 
immaterial 
may 
 also materially 
and adversely 
affect 
our business, 
operating results, 
financial condition 
and value 
of our 
 common stock. 
 Risks Relating to Our Business: 
 Increasing interest rates and inflationary conditions have and may continue 
to adversely impact 
 our customers discretionary income or willingness to purchase discretionary 
items, which may 
 adversely affect our business, margins, results of operations and financial condition.
 Increasing interest 
rates have 
adversely affected 
our customers 
discretionary income, 
in part 
due to 
 increased 
interest 
costs 
associated 
with 
credit 
accounts 
including 
revolving 
credit 
accounts, 
car 
loans, 
 mortgage loans and other credit accounts. 
In addition, the increased payments due to 
higher interest rates 
 deter our customers from 
purchasing discretionary items such as 
apparel, shoes and jewelry. 
Inflationary 
 pressures 
limit 
our 
customers 
willingness 
to 
purchase 
apparel, 
shoe 
or 
jewelry 
products, 
as 
prices 
 associated 
with 
non-discretionary 
products 
including 
food 
and 
fuel 
are 
increasing, 
reducing 
our 
 customers discretionary income. Any reduction in our customers discretionary spending on our products 
 could erode our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. 

 Increased product costs, freight costs, wage increases and operating 
costs due to inflation and 
 other factors, as well as limitations in our ability to offset these cost increases by increasing 
the 
 retail prices of our products or otherwise, have and may continue to adversely 
affect our business, 
 margins, results of operations and financial condition.
 Tight 
labor 
markets 
are 
causing 
wages 
to 
increase 
at 
the 
store, 
distribution 
center 
and 
home 
office 
 levels, as well 
as making it 
more difficult to 
hire new associates 
and retain existing associates. 
The tight 
 labor market 
and inflation 
also are 
driving up 
our operating 
costs. 
In addition, 
inflationary pressures 
on 
 labor 
and 
raw 
materials 
used 
to 
make 
our 
products 
may 
continue 
to 
increase 
the 
cost 
we 
pay 
for 
our 
 products. 
If we are 
unable to offset 
the effects 
of these increased 
costs to 
our business by 
increasing the 
 retail 
prices 
of 
our 
products, 
reducing 
other 
expenses 
or 
otherwise, 
our 
business, 
margins, 
results 
of 
 operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 Our 
ability 
to 
raise 
retail 
prices 
in 
response 
to 
these 
cost 
increases 
is 
limited, 
in 
part 
due 
to 
our 
 customers 
unwillingness 
to 
pay 
higher 
prices 
for 
discretionary 
items 
in 
light 
of 
actual 
or 
perceived 

11
 effects 
of 
inflation 
in 
increasing 
our 
customers 
cost 
of 
essential 
items 
and 
diminishing 
customers 
 disposable 
income 
or 
financial 
outlook. 
Moreover, 
the 
persistence 
or 
worsening 
of 
inflationary 
 conditions could also 
lead our customers 
to reduce their 
amount of current 
discretionary spending on our 
 products even in the 
absence of price increases, 
which could erode our 
sales volume and adversely 
affect 
 our results of operations and financial condition. 

 Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly 
and indirectly from overseas, 
 we are subject to risks associated with international operations and risks 
that affect the prevailing 
 social, economic, political, public health and other conditions in 
the areas from which we source 
 merchandise; changes, disruptions, increased costs 
or other problems affecting the Company s 
 merchandise supply chain have and could continue to materially and 
adversely affect the 
 Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
A significant amount of our merchandise is 
manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast Asia. We 
 directly import some of this merchandise and 
indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic 
 vendors 
who 
acquire 
the 
merchandise 
from 
foreign 
sources. 
Further, 
our 
third-party 
vendors 
are 
 dependent 
on 
materials 
primarily 
sourced 
from 
China. 
As 
a 
result, 
political 
unrest, 
labor 
disputes, 
 terrorism, 
war, 
public 
health 
threats, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
communicable 
diseases 
(such 
as 
 COVID-19), financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from 
 countries 
affecting 
our 
supply 
chain, 
increased 
security 
requirements 
for 
imported 
merchandise, 
or 
the 
 imposition of, or changes 
in, laws, regulations or 
changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, 
taxes or governmental 
 policies 
regarding 
or 
responses 
to 
these 
matters 
or 
other 
factors 
affecting 
the 
availability 
or 
cost 
of 
 imports, 
can 
cause 
significant delays 
or 
interruptions in 
the 
supply of 
our 
merchandise or 
increase our 
 costs. 
In 
addition, 
geopolitical 
tensions, 
sanctions, 
prohibitions, 
additional 
tariffs, 
compliance 
and 
 reporting requirements 
have resulted 
in increased 
costs associated 
with merchandise 
produced in 
certain 
 regions. 
Any new sanctions, tariffs and 
reporting requirements enacted in the future may further 
increase 
 our costs associated with sourcing products from those regions 
or limit our ability to procure the 
products 
 we 
source, 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
source 
these 
products 
from 
other 
regions 
may 
be 
limited 
or 
result 
in 
 increased sourcing costs. 
 We 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
supply 
chain 
disruptions 
affecting 
ocean 
freight, 
including 
lack 
of 
overall 
 ocean container shipping 
capacity versus the 
current demand for 
container shipping capacity, 
lack of our 
 ability to 
access the 
ocean container capacity 
that we 
require, lack 
of equipment 
such as 
containers, port 
 congestion, 
including 
increased 
dwell 
times 
for 
ocean 
container 
ships, 
and 
other 
conditions 
impacting 
 ocean 
freight. 
We 
also 
are 
subject 
to 
domestic 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, 
including 
lack 
of 
domestic 
 intermodal transportation (trucks 
and drivers), domestic 
port congestion, including 
increased dwell times 
 for incoming container ships, lack of container 
yard capacity and lack of available drayage from 
the ports 
 and 
other 
conditions 
that 
impact 
our 
domestic 
supply 
chain. 
These 
supply 
chain 
risks 
have 
and 
may 
 continue to 
result in 
both higher 
costs to 
transport our 
merchandise and 
delayed merchandise 
arrivals to 
 our stores, which adversely affect our ability to sell this merchandise and increase 
markdowns of it. 

 Our costs are 
also affected by currency 
fluctuations, and changes in 
the value of the 
dollar relative to 
 foreign 
currencies 
have 
and 
may 
continue 
to 
impact 
our 
cost 
of 
goods 
sold. 
Any 
of 
these 
factors 
can 
 materially and 
adversely affect 
our business 
and results of 
operations. 
In addition, 
increased energy 
and 
 transportation 
costs 
have 
caused 
us 
significant 
cost 
increases 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
and 
future 
adverse 
 changes 
in 
these 
costs 
or 
the 
disruption 
of 
the 
means 
by 
which 
merchandise 
is 
transported 
to 
us 
could 
 cause additional 
cost increases 
or interruptions 
of our 
supply chain, 
which could 
be significant. 
Further, 
 we are subject to 
increased costs or potential disruptions 
impacting any port or 
trade route through which 
 our products 
move, or we 
may be 
subject to 
increased costs 
and delays if 
forced to route 
freight through 
 different 
ports 
than 
the 
ones 
through 
which 
our 
products 
typically 
move. 
If 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
source 
 merchandise from 
other countries 
or other 
domestic vendors 
with foreign 
sources in 
different 
countries, 
 those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we 
now sell. 
 Adverse 
developments 
affecting 
the 
financial 
services 
industry, 
including 
events 
or 
concerns 
 involving 
liquidity, 
defaults 
or 
non-performance 
by 
financial 
institutions 
or 
transactional 

12
 counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results 
of operations. 
 Actual 
events 
involving limited 
liquidity, 
defaults, 
non-performance or 
other 
adverse 
developments 
 that affect 
financial institutions, 
transactional counterparties 
or other 
companies in 
the financial 
services 
 industry 
or 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
generally, 
or 
concerns 
or 
rumors 
about 
any 
events 
of 
these 
 kinds 
or 
other 
similar 
risks, 
have 
in 
the 
past 
and 
may 
in 
the 
future 
lead 
to 
sporadic 
or 
market-wide 
 liquidity problems that 
could adversely affect 
us. For example, 
on March 10, 
2023, Silicon Valley 
Bank, 
 or 
SVB, 
was 
closed 
by 
the 
California 
Department 
of 
Financial 
Protection 
and 
Innovation, 
which 
 appointed the 
Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, 
or the 
FDIC, as 
receiver. 
Similarly, 
on March 
12, 
 2023, 
Signature 
Bank 
was 
swept 
into 
receivership. 
In 
addition 
on 
March 
8, 
2023, 
Silvergate 
Capital 
 announced that 
it will 
liquidate its 
subsidiary, 
Silvergate 
Bank, and 
that the 
liquidation process 
is being 
 supervised by the California Department of Financial Protection and 
Innovation. Although a statement by 
 the 
Department 
of 
the 
Treasury, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
the 
FDIC 
stated 
that 
all 
depositors 
of 
SVB 
 would have 
access to 
all of 
their money 
after 
only one 
business day 
of 
closure, including 
funds 
held in 
 uninsured deposit accounts, borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and 
certain other financial 
 instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by 
 the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. 

 If 
any 
of 
our 
transactional 
counterparties, 
such 
as 
our 
merchandise 
vendors 
and 
their 
factors, 
our 
 landlords, our 
payment processors including 
credit card, 
gift card 
and checks, our 
transportation vendors 
 and 
other 
vendors 
that 
provide 
services 
and 
supplies 
to 
us, 
are 
unable 
to 
access 
funds 
or 
lending 
 arrangements 
with 
such 
a 
financial 
institution, 
such 
parties 
ability 
to 
pay 
their 
obligations 
could 
be 
 adversely 
affected. 
If 
this 
occurred 
we 
could 
be 
adversely 
impacted 
by 
not 
receiving 
the 
product 
we 
 ordered or 
the payments generated 
by our 
sales, by 
not being able 
to receive 
products to 
our distribution 
 center or 
our stores in 
a timely manner 
or at 
all, or by 
not being able 
to retain services 
from third 
parties 
 that we require. 
These impacts may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our 
 ability to execute our business strategy. 
 Furthermore, these 
adverse developments 
affecting the 
financial services 
or related 
perceptions may 
 negatively 
impact 
our 
customers 
discretionary 
income 
for 
or 
our 
customers 
willingness 
to 
purchase 
 apparel, 
shoes 
or 
jewelry 
products. 
Any 
reduction 
in 
our 
customers 
discretionary 
spending 
on 
our 
 products 
could 
erode 
our 
sales 
volume 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
 condition. 

 Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive 
consumer confidence and 
 spending have and may continue to materially and adversely affect consumer demand 
for our 
 apparel and accessories and our results of operations. 
 
Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel 
and accessories, are affected by, among 
 other things, prevailing social, economic, 
political and public health conditions 
and uncertainties (such as 
 matters under debate in the U.S. from time to 
time regarding budgetary, spending and 
tax policies), levels 
 of 
employment, fuel, 
interest rates, 
energy 
and 
food 
costs, 
salaries and 
wage rates 
and 
other sources 
of 
 income, 
tax 
rates, 
home 
values, 
consumer 
net 
worth, 
the 
availability 
of 
consumer 
credit, 
inflation, 
 consumer 
confidence 
and 
consumer 
perceptions 
of 
adverse 
changes 
in 
or 
trends 
affecting 
any 
of 
these 
 conditions. 
Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may 
 significantly 
weaken 
many 
of 
these 
drivers 
of 
consumer spending 
habits. 
Adverse 
perceptions 
of 
these 
 conditions 
or 
uncertainties 
regarding 
them 
also 
generally 
cause 
consumers 
to 
defer 
purchases 
of 
 discretionary items, such 
as our 
merchandise, or 
to purchase 
cheaper alternatives to 
our merchandise, 
all 
 of which may also 
adversely affect our 
net sales and 
results of operations. 
In addition, numerous events, 
 whether or not related to 
actual economic conditions, such as downturns 
in the stock markets, acts 
of war 
 or terrorism, political unrest 
or natural disasters, outbreaks of 
disease or similar events, 
may also dampen 
 consumer confidence, 
and accordingly, 
lead 
to 
reduced consumer 
spending. 
Any of 
these 
events could 
 have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial 
condition. 

13
 Extreme weather, natural disasters, public health threats or similar events have and may continue 
 to adversely affect our sales or operations from time to time. 
 
Extreme 
changes 
in 
weather, 
natural 
disasters, 
public 
health 
threats 
or 
similar 
events 
can 
influence 
 customer trends 
and shopping 
habits. 
For example, 
heavy rainfall 
or other 
extreme weather 
conditions, 
 including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
winter 
weather 
over 
a 
prolonged 
period, 
might 
make 
it 
difficult 
for 
our 
 customers 
to 
travel 
to 
our 
stores 
and 
thereby 
reduce 
our 
sales 
and 
profitability. 
Our 
business 
is 
also 
 susceptible 
to 
unseasonable weather 
conditions. 
For example, 
extended 
periods 
of 
unseasonably warm 
 temperatures during the 
winter season or 
cool weather during 
the summer season 
can render 
a portion of 
 our 
inventory 
incompatible 
with 
those 
unseasonable 
conditions. 
Reduced 
sales 
from 
extreme 
or 
 prolonged 
unseasonable 
weather 
conditions 
would 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business. 
The 
occurrence 
or 
 threat 
of 
extreme 
weather, 
natural 
disasters, 
power 
outages, 
terrorist 
acts, 
outbreaks 
of 
flu 
or 
other 
 communicable diseases (such as COVID-19) or other catastrophic events could reduce customer 
traffic in 
 our stores 
and likewise 
disrupt our 
ability to 
conduct operations, 
which would 
materially and 
adversely 
 affect us. 
 Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent 
on the success of our store 
 location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned. 
 
Our sales are 
dependent in part 
on the location 
of our stores in 
shopping centers and 
malls where we 
 believe our 
consumers and 
potential consumers 
shop. 
In addition, 
our ability 
to grow 
our 
revenues has 
 been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations. 

 Shopping centers 
and malls 
where we 
currently operate 
existing stores 
or seek 
to 
open new 
stores have 
 been and 
may continue 
to be 
adversely affected 
by, 
among other 
things, general 
economic downturns 
or 
 those 
particularly affecting 
the 
commercial real 
estate industry, 
the 
closing of 
anchor 
stores, changes 
in 
 tenant 
mix 
and 
changes 
in 
customer 
shopping 
preferences, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
 preference for online versus in-person shopping. 
To take 
advantage of consumer traffic and the 
shopping 
 preferences 
of 
our 
consumers, 
we 
need 
to 
maintain 
and 
acquire 
stores 
in 
desirable 
locations 
where 
 competition for suitable 
store locations is 
intense. A decline 
in customer popularity 
of the 
strip shopping 
 centers where we 
generally locate our 
stores or in 
availability of space 
in desirable centers 
and locations, 
 or an increase in the cost of such desired space, has limited and could further limit our ability to open new 
 stores, 
adversely 
affecting 
consumer 
traffic 
and 
reducing 
our 
sales 
and 
net 
earnings 
or 
increasing 
our 
 operating costs. 
 
Our ability 
to open 
and operate 
new stores 
depends on 
many factors, 
some of 
which are 
beyond our 
 control. 
These 
factors 
include, 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
our 
ability 
to 
identify 
suitable 
store 
locations, 
 negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure 
necessary governmental permits and approvals and 
hire and train 
 appropriate store personnel. 
In addition, our 
continued expansion into 
new regions of 
the country 
where 
 we 
have 
not 
done 
business 
before 
may 
present 
new 
challenges 
in 
competition, 
distribution 
and 
 merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely 
execute our plans for 
 opening new stores 
or the failure 
of these stores 
to perform up 
to our expectations 
could adversely affect 
 our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing 
fashion trends and 
 customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially 
 suffer. 

Customer 
tastes 
and 
fashion 
trends, 
particularly 
for 
women s 
apparel, 
are 
volatile, 
tend 
to 
change 
 rapidly 
and 
cannot 
be 
predicted 
with 
certainty. 
Our 
success 
depends 
in 
part 
upon 
our 
ability 
to 
 consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a 
 timely 
manner. 
Accordingly, 
any 
failure 
by 
us 
to 
anticipate, 
identify, 
design 
and 
respond 
to 
changing 
 fashion 
trends 
could 
adversely 
affect 
consumer 
acceptance 
of 
our 
merchandise, 
which 
in 
turn 
could 
 adversely affect our business, results 
of operations and our image with our 
customers. 
If we miscalculate 
 either the 
market for 
our merchandise 
or our 
customers tastes or 
purchasing habits, we 
may be required 

14
 to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which 
 would adversely affect our margins and results of operations. 
 The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the 
Company s specification 
 may adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Our 
dependence 
on 
third-party 
vendors 
to 
manufacture 
and 
supply 
our 
merchandise 
subjects 
us 
to 
 numerous risks that 
our vendors will 
fail to perform 
as we expect. 
For example, the 
deterioration in any 
 of 
our key 
vendors financial 
condition, their 
failure to 
ship merchandise 
in a 
timely manner 
that meets 
 our specifications, 
or other 
failures to 
follow our 
vendor guidelines 
or comply 
with applicable 
laws and 
 regulations, 
including 
compliant 
labor, 
environmental 
practices 
and 
product 
safety, 
could 
expose 
us 
to 
 operational, quality, 
competitive, reputational and 
legal risks. 
If we 
are not 
able to 
timely or 
adequately 
 replace the merchandise we currently 
source with merchandise produced elsewhere, 
or if our vendors fail 
 to 
perform as 
we 
expect, 
our 
business, results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
condition 
could 
be 
adversely 
 affected. 
Activities 
conducted 
by 
us 
or 
on 
our 
behalf 
outside 
the 
United 
States 
further 
subject 
us 
to 
 numerous 
U.S. 
and 
international 
regulations 
and 
compliance 
risks, 
as 
discussed 
below 
under 
 Risk 
 Factors 
Risks Relating 
to Accounting 
and Legal 
Matters - 
Our business 
operations subject 
us to 
legal 
 compliance and litigation 
risks, as well 
as regulations and 
regulatory enforcement priorities, which 
could 
 result in increased costs or liabilities, 
divert our management s attention 
or otherwise adversely affect our 
 business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Existing and increased competition in the women s retail apparel industry may negatively impact 
 our business, results of operations, financial condition and 
market share. 

The 
women s 
retail 
apparel 
industry 
is 
highly 
competitive. 
We 
compete 
primarily 
with 
discount 
 stores, 
mass 
merchandisers, 
department 
stores, 
off-price 
retailers, 
specialty 
stores 
and 
internet-based 
 retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources 
than we have. 

 Many 
of 
our 
competitors offer 
frequent 
promotions and 
reduce 
their 
selling prices. 
In some 
cases, 
our 
 competitors are expanding into 
markets in which we 
have a significant market 
presence. 
In addition, our 
 competitors 
also 
compete 
for 
the 
same 
retail 
store 
space. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
competition, 
we 
may 
 experience 
pricing 
pressures, 
increased 
marketing 
expenditures, 
increased 
costs 
to 
open 
new 
stores, 
as 
 well 
as 
loss 
of 
market 
share, 
which 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
results 
of 
 operations and financial condition. 
 Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory have and 
may 
 continue to negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of 
operations. 
 
Comparable 
sales 
are 
expected 
to 
continue 
to 
fluctuate 
in 
the 
future. 
Factors 
affecting 
comparable 
 sales 
include 
fashion 
trends, 
customer 
preferences, 
calendar 
and 
holiday 
shifts, 
competition, 
weather, 
 supply chain 
issues, actual 
or potential 
public health 
threats and 
economic conditions, 
including but 
not 
 limited to 
increasing interest rates 
and higher inflation. 
In addition, merchandise 
must be 
ordered well in 
 advance of 
the applicable 
selling season 
and before 
trends are 
confirmed by 
sales. If 
we are 
not able 
to 
 accurately predict customers preferences 
for our fashion items, 
we may have too 
much inventory, 
which 
 may cause excessive 
markdowns. If we 
are unable to accurately 
predict demand for our 
merchandise, we 
 may 
end 
up 
with 
inventory shortages, 
resulting in 
missed 
sales. 
A 
decrease 
in 
comparable 
sales 
or 
our 
 inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations. 
 The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia present increased operational and 
legal risks. 
 
In October 
2014, we 
established our 
own sourcing 
offices in 
Asia. If 
our sourcing 
offices are 
unable 
 to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure 
that product is produced on time and 
within the 
 Company s 
specifications, 
our 
business, 
brand, 
reputation, 
costs, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
 condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

15
 In addition, the current business environment, including geopolitical issues, make operating in 
certain 
 Asian 
markets 
challenging. 
To 
the 
extent 
we 
explore 
other 
countries 
to 
source 
our 
product 
or 
explore 
 increasing 
the 
amount 
of 
product 
sourced 
from 
current 
countries, 
we 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
additional 
 increased 
legal 
and 
operational risks 
associated 
with 
doing 
business 
in 
new 
countries 
or 
increasing our 
 business in other countries. 

 Further, 
the 
activities 
conducted 
by 
our 
sourcing 
offices 
outside 
the 
United 
States 
subject 
us 
to 
 foreign operational risks, 
as well as 
U.S. and international regulations 
and compliance risks, as 
discussed 
 elsewhere 
in 
this 
 Risk 
Factors 
section, 
in 
particular 
below 
under 
 Risk 
Factors 
 
Risks 
Relating 
to 
 Accounting 
and 
Legal 
Matters 
- 
Our 
business 
operations 
subject 
us 
to 
legal 
compliance 
and 
litigation 
 risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or 
 liabilities, 
divert 
our 
management s 
attention 
or 
otherwise 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
results 
of 
 operations and financial condition. 
 Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business 
and our 
 financial condition. 
 
Like most 
retailers, we 
experience significant 
associate turnover rates, 
particularly among store 
sales 
 associates and 
managers. 
Moreover, 
attracting and 
retaining skilled 
personnel has 
become increasingly 
 challenging in 
the tight 
labor market 
that has 
persisted since 
the onset 
of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
To 
 offset this 
turnover as 
well as 
support new 
store growth, 
we must 
continually attract, 
hire and 
train new 
 store 
associates 
to 
meet 
our 
staffing 
needs. 
A 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
turnover 
rate 
among 
our 
store 
 sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a 
 decrease in our store 
operating efficiency and productivity. 
We 
compete for qualified store associates, as 
 well 
as 
experienced 
management 
personnel, 
with 
other 
companies 
in 
our 
industry 
or 
other 
industries, 
 many of whom have greater financial resources than we do. 

In 
addition, 
we 
depend 
on 
key 
management 
personnel 
to 
oversee 
the 
operational 
divisions 
of 
the 
 Company 
for 
the 
support 
of 
our 
existing 
business 
and 
future 
expansion. 
The 
success 
of 
executing 
our 
 business strategy 
depends in 
large part 
on retaining 
key management. 
We 
compete for 
key management 
 personnel 
with 
other 
retailers, and 
our 
inability 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
qualified personnel 
could 
limit 
our 
 ability to continue to grow. 
 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
retain 
our 
key 
management 
and 
store 
associates 
or 
attract, 
train, 
or 
retain 
other 
 skilled 
personnel in 
the 
future, 
we 
may not 
be 
able 
to 
service 
our 
customers effectively 
or 
execute 
our 
 business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
The currently 
competitive environment 
for 
hiring new 
associates and 
retaining existing 
associates is 
 causing 
wages 
to 
increase, 
which 
has 
and 
could 
continue 
to 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
margins, 
 operating results and financial condition if we cannot offset these cost increases. 
 Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory have and 
may continue to result in 
 higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on 
to its customers. 
 
The price and availability of raw 
materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, 
weather and crop 
 yields, currency 
value fluctuations, 
inflation, as 
well as 
other factors. 
Additionally, 
manufacturers have 
 and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit 
 costs. These increases in production costs may result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. 
Due to 
 the 
Company s 
limited 
flexibility 
in 
price 
point, 
the 
Company 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
pass 
on 
those 
cost 
 increases 
to 
the 
consumer, 
which 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
margins, 
results 
of 
 operations and financial condition. 
 If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into 
its existing business, the 
 Company s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. 

16
 
The Company s 
long-term business 
strategy includes 
opportunistic growth 
through the 
development 
 of 
new 
store 
concepts. 
This 
growth 
may 
require 
significant 
capital 
expenditures 
and 
management 
 attention. The Company may not 
realize any of the 
anticipated benefits of a 
new business and integration 
 costs 
may 
exceed 
anticipated 
amounts. 
We 
have 
incurred 
substantial 
financial 
commitments 
and 
fixed 
 costs related to our retail stores that we 
will not be able to recover if our stores 
are not successful and that 
 have resulted and could result in future impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth 
 strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may 
be adversely impacted. 

 Risks Relating to Our Information Technology and Related Systems: 
 A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could 
adversely affect our 
 business. 
 
We 
rely 
on 
our 
existing 
information 
technology 
systems 
for 
merchandise 
operations, 
including 
 merchandise planning, 
replenishment, pricing, ordering, 
markdowns and 
product life 
cycle management. 

 In addition to 
merchandise operations, we utilize 
our information technology systems for 
our distribution 
 processes, 
as 
well 
as 
our 
financial 
systems, 
including 
accounts 
payable, 
general 
ledger, 
accounts 
 receivable, sales, 
banking, inventory 
and fixed 
assets. 
Despite the 
precautions we 
take, our 
information 
 systems are or may be vulnerable to disruption 
or failure from numerous events, including but not limited 
 to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts 
 of 
war 
or 
terrorism, 
similar 
catastrophic 
events 
or 
other 
causes 
beyond 
our 
control 
or 
that 
we 
fail 
to 
 anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to 
 continue 
to 
upgrade 
or 
improve 
such 
systems, 
or 
the 
cost 
associated 
with 
maintaining, 
repairing 
or 
 improving 
these 
systems, 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
 condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to 
our current information technology systems may also 
disrupt 
 our operations. 

 A security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure of 
employee, Company or 
 customer information or a ransomware attack could adversely affect our costs, 
reputation and 
 results of operations, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase 
our costs. 

The 
protection 
of 
employee, 
Company and 
customer 
data 
is 
critical 
to 
the 
Company. 
Any 
security 
 breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss 
 or 
other 
unauthorized 
disclosure 
of 
employee, 
Company 
or 
customer 
information, 
including 
but 
not 
 limited 
to 
credit 
card 
data 
or 
other 
personally 
identifiable 
information, 
could 
severely 
damage 
the 
 Company's reputation, expose it to 
remediation and other costs 
and the risks of legal 
proceedings, disrupt 
 its 
operations 
and 
otherwise 
adversely 
affect 
the 
Company's 
business 
and 
financial 
condition. 
The 
 security of certain of 
this information also depends on 
the ability of third-party 
service providers, such as 
 those 
we 
use 
to 
process 
credit 
and 
debit 
card 
payments 
as 
described 
below 
under 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
 payment-related 
risks, 
to 
properly 
handle 
and 
protect 
such 
information. 
Our 
information 
systems 
and 
 those of our 
third-party service providers are 
subject to ongoing and 
persistent cybersecurity threats from 
 those seeking unauthorized 
access through means 
which are 
continually evolving and 
may be difficult 
to 
 anticipate or detect for long periods 
of time. 
Despite measures the Company takes 
to protect confidential 
 information against 
unauthorized access 
or disclosure, which 
measures are 
ongoing and 
may continue 
to 
 increase 
our 
costs, 
there 
is 
no 
assurance 
that 
such 
measures 
will 
prevent 
the 
compromise 
of 
such 
 information. If 
any such 
compromise or 
unauthorized access 
to or 
disclosure of 
this information 
were to 
 occur, 
it 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
Company's reputation, 
business, 
operating 
results, 
 financial 
condition 
and 
cash 
flows. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
ransomware 
attacks, 
 which if 
successful could 
result in 
disruptions to the 
Company s operations 
and expose it 
to remediation 
 and 
other 
costs, 
risks 
of 
legal 
proceedings, 
damage 
the 
Company s 
reputation 
and 
otherwise 
adversely 
 affect the Company's business and financial condition. 
 A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or 
transportation network could 
 materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

17
 
The distribution 
of our 
products is 
centralized in 
one distribution 
center in 
Charlotte, North 
Carolina 
 and 
distributed 
through 
our 
network 
of 
third-party 
freight 
carriers. 
The 
merchandise 
we 
purchase 
is 
 shipped directly to 
our distribution center, 
where it is 
prepared for shipment 
to the appropriate 
stores and 
 subsequently delivered 
to 
the 
stores 
by our 
third-party freight 
carriers. 
If the 
distribution 
center or 
our 
 third-party freight carriers were 
to be shut down 
or lose significant capacity 
for any reason, including 
but 
 not limited to, any of the causes described above under A failure or disruption 
relating to our information 
 technology 
systems 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
our 
operations 
would 
likely 
be 
seriously 
 disrupted. 
Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to 
 use 
our 
distribution center, 
as 
well 
as 
any broader 
problem generally 
affecting 
the ability 
to 
ship 
goods 
 into our distribution center or deliver goods 
to our stores. 
As a result, we could incur significantly higher 
 costs and longer lead 
times associated with distributing our 
products to our stores during 
the time it takes 
 for us to reopen or 
replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such 
occurrence 
 could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Company s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer 
 expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation 
and our business.
 
Although 
the 
Company's e-commerce 
platform provides 
another channel 
to 
drive 
incremental 
sales, 
 provide existing customers the online shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer 
 base, 
it 
also 
exposes 
us 
to 
numerous 
risks. 
We 
are 
subject 
to 
potential 
failures 
in 
the 
efficient 
and 
 uninterrupted 
operation 
of 
our 
websites, 
customer 
contact 
center 
or 
our 
distribution 
center, 
including 
 system 
failures 
caused 
by 
telecommunication 
system 
providers, 
order 
volumes 
that 
exceed 
our 
present 
 system capabilities, electrical outages, 
mechanical problems and human error. 
Our e-commerce platform 
 may also expose us 
to greater potential for 
security or data 
breaches involving the unauthorized access 
to 
 or 
disclosure 
of 
customer 
information, 
as 
discussed 
above 
under 
 A 
security 
breach 
that 
results 
in 
 unauthorized 
access 
to 
or 
disclosure 
of 
employee, 
Company 
or 
customer 
information 
or 
a 
ransomware 
 attack could 
adversely affect 
our costs, 
reputation and 
results of 
operations, and 
efforts to 
mitigate these 
 risks may 
continue to 
increase our 
costs. We 
are also 
subject to 
risk related 
to delays 
or failures 
in the 
 performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including 
delays associated with labor strikes or 
 slowdowns or 
adverse weather 
conditions. If 
the Company 
does not 
successfully meet 
the challenges 
of 
 operating 
e-commerce 
websites 
or 
fulfilling 
customer 
expectations, 
the 
Company's 
business 
and 
sales 
 could be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to payment-related risks.
 
We 
accept payments 
using a 
variety of 
methods, including 
third-party credit 
cards, our 
own branded 
 credit 
card, 
debit 
cards, 
gift 
cards 
and 
physical 
and 
electronic 
bank 
checks. 
For 
existing 
and 
future 
 payment methods we offer to our customers, we are subject to fraud risk and 
to additional regulations and 
 compliance 
requirements 
(including 
obligations 
to 
implement 
enhanced 
authentication 
processes 
that 
 could 
result 
in 
increased 
costs 
and 
reduce 
the 
ease 
of 
use 
of 
certain 
payment 
methods). 
For 
certain 
 payment 
methods, 
including 
credit 
and 
debit 
cards, 
we 
pay 
interchange 
and 
other 
fees, 
which 
have 
 increased 
from 
time 
to 
time 
and 
may 
continue 
to 
increase 
over 
time, 
raising 
our 
operating 
costs 
and 
 lowering profitability. We 
rely on third-party service providers for payment processing 
services, including 
 the 
processing 
of 
credit 
and 
debit 
cards. 
In 
each 
case, 
it 
could 
disrupt 
our 
business if 
these 
third-party 
 service 
providers 
become 
unwilling 
or 
unable 
to 
provide 
these 
services 
to 
us. 
We 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
 payment 
card 
association 
operating 
rules, 
including 
data 
security 
rules, 
certification 
requirements 
and 
 rules governing 
electronic funds 
transfers, which 
could change 
or be 
reinterpreted to 
make it 
difficult or 
 impossible for us 
to comply. 
If we fail 
to comply with 
these rules or 
requirements, or if 
our data security 
 systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing 
banks costs, subject to fines and 
 higher transaction fees. In addition, we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from 
 our 
customers 
and 
process 
electronic 
funds 
transfers 
or 
facilitate 
other 
types 
of 
payments, 
and 
our 
 business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Risks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters: 

18
 Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported 
results of 
 operations and financial condition. 
 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
provide 
greater 
comparability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
in 
an 
increasing 
global 
 environment, accounting regulatory authorities 
have been in 
discussions for many years 
regarding efforts 
 to either converge U.S. 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial 
Reporting 
 Standards IFRS ), 
have U.S. 
companies 
provide supplemental 
IFRS-based information 
or 
continue to 
 work 
toward 
a 
single 
set 
of 
globally 
accepted 
accounting 
standards. 
If 
implemented, 
these 
potential 
 changes 
in 
accounting 
rules 
or 
regulations 
could 
significantly 
impact 
our 
future 
reported 
results 
of 
 operations and financial 
position. 
Changes in accounting 
rules or 
regulations and varying interpretations 
 of existing 
accounting rules 
and regulations 
have significantly 
affected our 
reported financial 
statements 
 and those 
of other 
participants in 
the retail 
industry in 
the past 
and may 
continue to 
do so 
in the 
future. 
 Future changes to 
accounting rules or 
regulations may adversely 
affect our 
reported results of 
operations 
 and financial position or perceptions of our performance and financial 
condition. 
 Continued scrutiny and changing 
expectations surrounding environmental, social and governance 
 ESG 
matters 
from 
investors, 
customers, 
government 
regulators 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
may 
 impose additional reporting requirements, additional costs and compliance 
risks. 

 Public companies from 
across all 
industries are facing 
increasing scrutiny from 
investors, customers, 
 government 
regulators 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
concerning 
ESG 
matters. 
In 
the 
U.S., 
there 
are 
various 
 proposals 
for 
new 
or 
enhanced 
disclosure 
requirements 
regarding 
climate 
emissions, 
sustainability, 
 workforce 
diversity 
and 
other 
human 
capital 
resources 
metrics, 
among 
other 
topics. 
Complying 
with 
 these complex 
reporting obligations 
or expectations 
may increase 
our costs 
associated with 
compliance, 
 disclosure and reporting. 
Furthermore, evolving ESG laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations may 
 result 
in 
uncertain 
and 
potentially 
burdensome 
reporting 
requirements 
as 
stakeholders, 
agencies 
and 
 government 
authorities 
adjust 
their 
expectations 
or 
change 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
such 
as 
proposals 
 currently under consideration regarding climate emissions reporting and auditing requirements. 
Failure to 
 comply 
with 
all 
of 
the 
currently 
proposed 
regulatory 
requirements 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
may 
adversely 
 affect our reputation, business and financial performance. 
 If 
we 
fail 
to 
protect 
our 
trademarks 
and 
other 
intellectual 
property 
rights 
or 
infringe 
the 
 intellectual 
property 
rights 
of 
others, 
our 
business, 
brand 
image, 
growth 
strategy, 
results 
of 
 operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
We 
believe 
that 
our 
 Cato , 
 It s 
Fashion , 
 It s 
Fashion 
Metro , 
 Versona , 
 Cache 
and 
 Body 
 Central 
trademarks 
are 
integral 
to 
our 
store 
designs, 
brand 
recognition 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
successfully 
 build 
consumer 
loyalty. 
Although 
we 
have 
registered 
these 
trademarks 
with 
the 
U.S. 
Patent 
and 
 Trademark Office PTO and 
have also 
registered, or 
applied for 
registration of, 
additional trademarks 
 with 
the 
PTO 
that 
we 
believe 
are 
important 
to 
our 
business, 
we 
cannot 
give 
assurance 
that 
these 
 registrations 
will 
prevent 
imitation 
of 
our 
trademarks, 
merchandising 
concepts, 
store 
designs 
or 
private 
 label merchandise or 
the infringement of 
our other intellectual 
property rights by 
others. Infringement of 
 our 
names, 
concepts, 
store 
designs 
or 
merchandise 
generally, 
or 
particularly 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
projects 
 lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of 
our image could adversely affect our business, financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 
In addition, 
we cannot 
give assurance 
that others will 
not try 
to block 
the manufacture 
or sale 
of our 
 private label merchandise by claiming 
that our merchandise violates 
their trademarks or other 
proprietary 
 rights. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
such 
a 
conflict, 
we 
could 
be 
subject 
to 
lawsuits 
or 
other 
actions, 
the 
ultimate 
 resolution of 
which we 
cannot predict; 
however, 
such a 
controversy could 
adversely affect 
our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, 
as well as regulations 
 and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased 
costs or liabilities, divert our 

19
 management s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and 
 financial condition. 
 
Our operations 
are subject 
to federal, 
state and 
local laws, 
rules and 
regulations, as 
well as 
U.S. and 
 foreign 
laws 
and 
regulations 
relating 
to 
our 
activities 
in 
foreign 
countries 
from 
which 
we 
source 
our 
 merchandise 
and 
operate our 
sourcing offices. 
Our 
business is 
also 
subject 
to 
regulatory and 
litigation 
 risk in 
all of 
these jurisdictions, including 
foreign jurisdictions 
that may 
lack well-established 
or reliable 
 legal 
systems 
for 
resolving 
legal 
disputes. 
Compliance 
risks 
and 
litigation 
claims 
have 
arisen 
and 
may 
 continue 
to 
arise 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
our 
business 
and 
include, 
among 
other 
issues, 
intellectual 
 property 
issues, 
employment 
issues, 
commercial 
disputes, 
product-oriented 
matters, 
tax, 
customer 
 relations and personal injury claims. International 
activities subject us to numerous U.S. 
and international 
 regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and 
 export 
license 
requirements, 
privacy 
and 
data 
protection 
laws, 
environmental 
laws, 
records 
and 
 information 
management 
regulations, 
tariffs 
and 
taxes 
and 
anti-corruption 
laws, 
such 
as 
the 
Foreign 
 Corrupt Practices Act, violations 
of which by employees 
or persons acting on 
the Company s 
behalf may 
 result in 
significant investigation 
costs, severe 
criminal or 
civil sanctions 
and reputational 
harm. 
These 
 and 
other 
liabilities 
to 
which we 
may 
be 
subject 
could 
negatively 
affect 
our 
business, operating 
results 
 and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject 
 to 
risks 
and 
uncertainties 
and 
could 
divert 
significant 
management 
time. 
The 
Company 
may 
also 
be 
 subject 
to 
regulatory 
review 
and 
audits, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 business, results of 
operations and financial condition. 
In addition, governing laws, 
rules and regulations, 
 and interpretations 
of existing 
laws 
are subject 
to 
change from 
time to 
time. 
Compliance and 
litigation 
 matters 
could 
result 
in 
unexpected 
expenses 
and 
liability, 
as 
well 
as 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
 operations and our reputation. 
 
New 
legislation 
or 
regulation 
and 
interpretation 
of 
existing 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
including 
those 
 related 
to 
data 
privacy, 
climate 
change 
or 
ESG 
matters 
could 
increase 
our 
costs 
of 
compliance, 
 technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing or new laws to 
existing technology and 
 business practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance 
risk and cost. 
 Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial 
condition.
 
From 
time 
to 
time 
the 
Company 
is 
involved 
in 
litigation 
and 
other 
claims 
against 
our 
business. 
 Primarily these 
arise from 
our 
normal 
course 
of 
business 
but 
are 
subject to 
risks and 
uncertainties, and 
 could 
require 
significant 
management 
time. 
The 
Company s 
periodic 
evaluation 
of 
litigation-related 
 matters may change our assessment in light 
of the discovery of facts with respect to 
legal actions pending 
 against 
us, not 
presently known 
to 
us 
or 
by determination 
of 
judges, juries 
or 
other finders 
of 
fact. 
We 
 may also 
be subjected 
to legal 
matters not 
yet known to 
us. Adverse 
decisions or settlements 
of disputes 
 may negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition. 
 Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting 
and other requirements 
 necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and 
any material failure in 
 these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common 
stock and market 
 confidence in our reported financial information. 
 
As a 
public company, 
we are 
subject to 
the reporting 
requirements of 
the Securities 
Exchange Act 
of 
 1934, the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002, 
the rules 
of the 
SEC and 
New York 
Stock Exchange 
and certain 
 aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act and 
 related rule-making that 
has been and 
may continue to 
be implemented over 
the next several 
years under 
 the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The 
requirements of these rules and regulations have increased, and 
 may continue to increase, our compliance costs and 
place significant strain on our personnel, systems and 
 resources. 
To 
satisfy 
the 
SEC s 
rules 
implementing 
the 
requirements 
of 
Section 
404 
of 
the 
Sarbanes-
 Oxley Act 
of 
2002, we 
must continue 
to 
document, test, 
monitor and 
enhance our 
internal control 
over 
 financial reporting, which is 
a costly and time-consuming effort 
that must be re-evaluated 
frequently. We 
 cannot give 
assurance that 
our disclosure 
controls and 
procedures and 
our internal 
control over 
financial 

20
 reporting, as 
defined by applicable 
SEC rules, 
will be adequate 
in the future. 
Any failure 
to maintain the 
 effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
or 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
other 
various 
laws 
and 
 regulations to 
which we 
are and 
will continue 
to be 
subject, or 
to 
which we 
may become 
subject in 
the 
 future, 
as 
a 
public 
company 
could 
have 
an 
adverse 
material 
impact 
on 
our 
business, 
our 
financial 
 condition and 
the price 
of our 
common stock. 
In addition, 
our efforts 
to comply 
with these 
existing and 
 new requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs. 
 Risks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity: 
 We may experience market conditions or other events that could adversely impact the valuation 
 and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, 
cash and cash equivalents 
 and our revolving line of credit. 
 
Our 
short-term investments 
and 
cash 
equivalents are 
primarily 
comprised of 
investments in 
federal, 
 state, municipal 
and corporate 
debt securities. 
The value 
of those 
securities may 
be adversely 
impacted 
 by factors relating to these securities, 
similar securities or the broader credit 
markets in general. 
Many of 
 these factors 
are beyond our 
control, and include 
but are 
not limited to 
changes to credit 
ratings, rates of 
 default, collateral 
value, discount 
rates, and 
strength and 
quality of 
market credit 
and liquidity, 
potential 
 disruptions in the capital 
markets and changes in the 
underlying economic, financial and other 
conditions 
 that drive these 
factors. 
As federal, state 
and municipal entities 
struggle with declining 
tax revenues and 
 budget deficits, 
we cannot 
be assured 
of our 
ability to 
timely access 
these investments 
if the 
market for 
 these issues declines. 
Similarly, 
the default by 
issuers of the 
debt securities we 
hold or similar 
securities 
 could impair the liquidity 
of our investments. 
The development or persistence 
of any of these 
conditions 
 could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
ability 
to 
execute 
our 
business 
 strategy. 
In 
addition, 
we 
have significant 
amounts 
of 
cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents at 
financial 
institutions 
 that 
are 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
federally 
insured 
limits. 
An 
economic 
downturn 
or 
development 
of 
adverse 
 conditions affecting the financial sector 
and stability of financial institutions could cause 
us to experience 
 losses on our deposits. 
 
Our ability 
to access 
credit markets 
and our 
revolving line 
of credit, 
either generally 
or on 
favorable 
 market terms, may be 
impacted by the 
factors discussed in 
the preceding paragraph, as 
well as continued 
 compliance with covenants under 
our revolving credit agreement. The 
development or persistence of 
any 
 of these 
adverse factors or 
failure to 
comply with covenants 
on which our 
borrowing is conditioned 
may 
 adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
execute 
our 
business 
 strategy. 

 Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock: 
 The interests of our principal shareholder may limit the ability of other 
shareholders to influence 
 the direction of the Company and otherwise affect our corporate governance and 
the market price 
 of our common stock. 
 
As of March 23, 2023, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially 
 owned approximately 51.0 
of the combined 
voting power of 
our common stock. 
As a result, 
Mr. 
Cato 
 has the ability to substantially influence or determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval by the 
 shareholders, 
including 
the 
election 
of 
directors 
and 
the 
approval 
of 
mergers 
and 
other 
business 
 combinations 
or 
other 
significant 
Company 
transactions. 
Mr. 
Cato 
may 
have 
interests 
that 
differ 
from 
 those of other shareholders, and 
may vote in a 
way with which other shareholders disagree 
or perceive as 
 adverse to their interests. 
The concentration of voting power held by Mr. 
Cato could discourage potential 
 investors from acquiring our 
common stock and could 
also have the effect 
of preventing, discouraging or 
 deferring a change in control of the Company or other fundamental transaction, all 
of which could depress 
 the market price of our common stock. 
In addition, Mr. 
Cato has the ability to control the 
management of 
 the 
Company 
as 
a 
result 
of 
his 
position 
as 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer. 
We 
qualify 
for 
exemption 
as 
a 
 controlled 
company 
from 
compliance 
with 
certain 
New 
York 
Stock 
Exchange 
corporate 
governance 
 rules, 
including 
the 
requirements 
that 
we 
have 
a 
majority 
of 
independent 
directors 
on 
our 
Board, 
an 

21
 independent 
compensation 
committee 
and 
an 
independent 
corporate 
governance 
and 
nominating 
 committee. 
If we 
elected to 
utilize these 
 controlled company exceptions, 
our other shareholders 
could 
 lose the 
benefit of 
these corporate 
governance requirements 
and the 
market value 
of 
our common 
stock 
 could be adversely affected. 
 Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, 
which could adversely 
 affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
Our business 
varies with 
general seasonal 
trends that 
are characteristic 
of the 
retail apparel 
industry. 

 As a 
result, our 
stores typically 
generate a 
higher percentage 
of our 
annual net 
sales and 
profitability in 
 the 
first 
and second 
quarters of 
our 
fiscal 
year 
compared to 
other 
quarters. 
Accordingly, 
our 
operating 
 results for 
any one 
fiscal period 
are not 
necessarily indicative 
of results 
to 
be expected 
from any 
future 
 period, 
and 
such 
seasonal 
and 
quarterly 
fluctuations 
could 
adversely 
affect 
the 
market 
price 
of 
our 
 common stock. 
 Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or 
 common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our 
common stock and 
 make its trading price more volatile. 
 
The trading 
price of 
our common 
stock at 
times has 
been, and 
is likely 
to continue 
to be, 
subject to 
 significant volatility. 
A variety of 
factors may cause 
the price of 
our common stock to 
fluctuate, perhaps 
 substantially, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
those 
discussed 
elsewhere 
in 
this 
report, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 following: low 
trading volume; 
general market 
fluctuations resulting 
from factors 
not directly 
related to 
 our operations or the inherent value of 
our common stock; announcements of developments related to our 
 business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived 
 to affect 
the fashion and 
retail industry; conditions or 
trends affecting or 
perceived to affect 
the domestic 
 or global 
economy or 
the domestic 
or global 
credit or 
capital markets; 
changes in 
financial estimates 
or 
 the scope 
of coverage 
given to 
our Company 
by securities 
analysts; negative 
commentary regarding 
our 
 Company 
and 
corresponding 
short-selling 
market 
behavior; 
adverse 
customer 
relations 
developments; 
 significant changes 
in our 
senior management 
team; and 
legal proceedings. 
Over the 
past several 
years 
 the stock 
market in 
general, and the 
market for shares 
of equity 
securities of many 
retailers in 
particular, 
 have 
experienced 
extreme 
price 
fluctuations 
that 
have 
at 
times 
been 
unrelated 
to 
the 
operating 
 performance of 
those companies. 
Such fluctuations 
and market 
volatility based 
on these 
or other 
factors 
 may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 Recent Developments 
 Inflationary Cost Pressure and Rising Interest Rates 
 
The current high 
inflationary environment continues to 
impact the Company 
through higher operating 
 costs, including costs to ship our products to stores and customers, operating supplies, wages, and 
fuel. 
In 
 addition 
to 
the 
price 
increases, 
costs 
for 
fuel, 
food, 
and 
housing, 
including 
rent, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
 consumables across 
the economy, 
are increasingly 
impacting our 
customers disposable 
income, as 
well 
 as our customers willingness to purchase discretionary items such as 
apparel, jewelry or shoes. 
 
In 
response 
to 
the 
inflationary 
pressures, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
began 
raising 
interest 
rates 
and 
is 
 committed to continue 
raising interest rates 
until the inflationary 
pressures subside. 
These rising interest 
 rates 
have 
adversely 
affected 
the 
availability 
and 
cost 
of 
credit 
for 
businesses 
and 
our 
customers. 
In 
 addition, 
the 
rising 
interest 
rates 
are 
increasing 
the 
costs 
related 
to 
revolving 
credit, 
auto 
loans 
and 
 mortgages, which increasingly is 
negatively impacting our customers 
discretionary income. 
In addition, 
 rising interest rates may negatively impact our customers willingness 
to purchase our products. 
 
We 
believe that 
these price 
increases and 
rising interest 
rates have 
had an 
impact during 
fiscal 2022, 
 and will likely continue to have 
a negative impact on consumer behavior 
and, by extension, our results of 
 operations and financial condition during fiscal 2023. 
 Labor Challenges and Wage Inflation 

The COVID-19 
pandemic 
and the 
resulting factors 
above have 
also 
created challenges 
related to 
the 
 availability of sufficient labor from time to time, and have caused a significant increase in the competition 
 for labor 
among consumer-facing companies. 
This competition 
for labor 
has driven 
significant increases 
 in 
wages 
in 
order 
to 
compete 
for 
sufficient 
labor 
availability 
and/or 
to 
prevent 
the 
loss 
of 
existing 
 workforce in 
our 
stores, 
distribution center 
and 
corporate office. 
We 
expect these 
pressures to 
continue 
 throughout fiscal 2023.

 Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021 
 
Retail sales 
decreased by 
1.2 to 
 752.4 million 
in fiscal 
2022 compared 
to 761.4 
million in 
fiscal 
 2021. The 
decrease in 
retail sales 
in fiscal 
2022 was 
primarily due 
to a 
1 decrease 
in same-store 
sales 
 and sales 
from closed 
stores in 
2021, 
partially offset by 
stores opened 
in 
2022. Same-store sales 
for 
the 
 fiscal 
year 2022 
decreased primarily 
due to 
lower 
average unit 
selling price 
resulting from 
late 
arriving 
 merchandise due to supply chain disruptions in the first half of 2022. Same-store sales includes stores that 
 have been 
open more 
than 15 
months. Stores 
that have 
been relocated 
or expanded 
are also 
included in 
 the same-store sales calculation after they have been open more than 
15 months. 
In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 
 2021, e-commerce 
sales were 
less than 
6 and 
5 of 
total sales 
and same-store sales, 
respectively. 
The 
 method of 
calculating same-store 
sales varies 
across the 
retail industry. 
As a 
result, our 
same-store sales 
 calculation 
may 
not 
be 
comparable 
to 
similarly 
titled 
measures 
reported 
by 
other 
companies. 
Total 
 revenues, comprised 
of retail sales and other 
revenue (principally 
finance charges and 
late fees on customer 
 accounts receivable, 
gift 
card 
breakage, shipping 
charges 
for 
e-commerce purchases 
and 
layaway fees), 
 decreased 
by 
1.3 
to 
 759.3 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2022 
compared 
to 
 769.3 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2021. 
The 
 Company 
operated 
1,280 
stores 
at 
January 
28, 
2023 
compared 
to 
1,311 
stores 
operated 
at 
January 
29, 
 2022. 
 
In fiscal 2022, the Company opened 19 new stores and closed 50 stores. 
 
Other 
revenue, 
a 
component 
of 
total 
revenues, 
decreased 
to 
 6.9 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2022 
from 
 7.9 
 million in fiscal 2021. 
The decrease resulted primarily due to 
decreases in gift card breakage income and 
 e-commerce shipping revenues, 
partially offset by an increase in finance and layaway charges. 
 
Credit 
revenue 
of 
 2.2 
million 
represented 
0.3 
of 
total 
revenue 
in 
fiscal 
2022, 
a 
 0.1 
million 
 increase compared to fiscal 2021 credit 
revenue of 2.1 million or 0.3 of 
total revenue. 
The increase in 
 credit revenue was 
primarily due to 
increases in finance 
charges and late 
fee income as 
a result of 
higher 
 accounts receivable 
balances. 
Credit revenue 
is comprised 
of interest 
earned on 
the Company s 
private 
 label credit 
card portfolio 
and related 
fee income. 
Related expenses 
include 
principally payroll, 
postage 
 and 
other 
administrative 
expenses 
and 
totaled 
 1.7 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2022 
compared 
to 
 1.4 
million 
in 
 fiscal 2021. 
See Note 
13 of 
Notes to 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
a schedule 
of credit-related 
 expenses. Total 
credit segment 
income before 
taxes was 
 0.6 million 
in 
fiscal 2022 
and 0.6 
million in 
 fiscal 2021. 

Cost 
of 
goods sold 
was 509.7 
million, or 
67.7 of 
retail 
sales, in 
fiscal 
2022 compared 
to 
 453.1 
 million, or 59.5 of retail sales, in fiscal 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold as a 
percentage of sales 
 resulted primarily 
from 
higher sales 
of 
marked down 
goods 
and 
increases in 
freight and 
distribution 
costs. 

 The Company 
expects markdown 
sales to 
decrease in 
2023 and 
beyond, as 
the markdown 
sales increase 
is 

29
 primarily 
attributed 
to 
the 
supply 
chain 
disruption 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2022, 
causing 
goods 
to 
miss 
their 
 optimum selling 
times. 
Cost of 
goods sold 
includes merchandise 
costs, net 
of discounts 
and allowances, 
 buying costs, 
distribution costs, 
occupancy costs, 
and freight 
and inventory 
shrinkage. Net 
merchandise 
 costs 
and 
in-bound 
freight 
are 
capitalized 
as 
inventory 
costs. 
Buying 
and 
distribution 
costs 
include 
 payroll, payroll-related 
costs and 
operating expenses 
for the 
buying departments 
and distribution 
center. 
 Occupancy 
expenses 
include 
rent, 
real 
estate 
taxes, 
insurance, 
common 
area 
maintenance, 
utilities 
and 
 maintenance 
for 
stores 
and 
distribution 
facilities. 
Total 
gross 
margin 
dollars 
(retail 
sales 
less 
cost 
of 
 goods 
sold and excluding depreciation) 
decreased by 21.3 to 242.7 
million in fiscal 2022 
from 308.3 
 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin as presented may not be comparable 
to that of other companies. 

Selling, general 
and administrative expenses SG A ), which 
primarily include corporate 
and store 
 payroll, 
related 
payroll 
taxes 
and 
benefits, 
insurance, 
supplies, 
advertising, 
bank 
and 
credit 
card 
 processing fees were 
 242.6 million in 
fiscal 2022 compared 
to 267.0 million 
in fiscal 2021, 
a decrease 
 of 9.1 . 
As a 
percent of 
retail sales, SG A 
was 32.3 
compared to 
35.1 in the 
prior year. 
The dollar 
 decrease in 
SG A expense was 
primarily attributable to lower 
employee benefit/bonus 
expense and lower 
 insurance costs, 
partially offset 
by higher 
store wages 
resulting from 
higher hourly 
rates and increased 
store 
 operating hours. 
 
Depreciation 
expense 
was 
 11.1 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2022 
compared 
to 
 12.4 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2021. 
 Depreciation 
expense 
decreased 
from 
fiscal 
2021 
due 
to 
fully 
depreciated 
older 
stores 
and 
prior 
period 
 impairments 
of 
leasehold 
improvements 
and 
fixtures, 
partially 
offset 
by 
store 
development 
and 
 information technology expenditures. 
 
Interest and 
other income 
increased to 
 5.9 million 
in fiscal 
2022 compared 
to 2.1 
million in 
fiscal 
 2021. 
The 
increase 
is 
primarily 
attributable 
to 
receiving 
a 
Business 
Recovery 
Grant 
from 
the 
State 
of 
 North 
Carolina, 
proceeds 
from property 
insurance 
claims related 
to 
hurricanes in 
fiscal 
years 
2021 
and 
 2020 and an 
increase in interest 
income from short-term investments 
due to rising 
interest rates, partially 
 offset by lower short-term investments. 
 
Income tax 
expense was 
 1.7 million, 
or 0.2 
of retail 
sales in 
fiscal 2022 
compared to 
income tax 
 expense 
of 
 2.1 
million, 
or 
0.3 
of 
retail 
sales 
in 
fiscal 
2021. 
The 
income 
tax 
expense 
decrease 
was 
 primarily due 
to lower 
pre-tax income 
and lower 
federal, state 
and local 
tax benefits, 
partially offset 
by 
 Global Intangible Low-taxed Income GILTI and 
non-deductible officer s compensation. The effective 
 tax rate 
was 98.4 (Expense) 
in fiscal 
2022 compared to 
5.4 (Expense) in 
fiscal 2021. 
See Note 12 
to 
 the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for further details.
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
None. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company s 
accounting policies are 
more fully described 
in Note 
1 to the 
Consolidated Financial 
 Statements. As disclosed 
in Note 1 
of Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the preparation 
of 
 the 
Company s 
financial 
statements 
in 
conformity with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles 
in 
the 
 United 
States GAAP 
requires 
management 
to 
make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
about 
future 
events 
 that 
affect 
the 
amounts reported 
in 
the 
financial statements 
and 
accompanying notes. 
Future events 
and 
 their 
effects 
cannot 
be 
determined 
with 
absolute 
certainty. 
Therefore, 
the 
determination 
of 
estimates 
 requires 
the 
exercise 
of 
judgment. 
Actual 
results 
inevitably 
will 
differ 
from 
those 
estimates, 
and 
such 
 differences 
may 
be 
material 
to 
the 
financial 
statements. 
The 
most 
significant 
accounting 
estimates 
 inherent 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Company s 
financial 
statements 
include 
the 
allowance 
for 
customer 
 credit losses, 
inventory shrinkage, 
the calculation 
of potential 
asset impairment, 
workers compensation, 
 general 
and 
auto 
insurance 
liabilities, 
reserves 
relating 
to 
self-insured 
health 
insurance, 
uncertain 
tax 
 positions, and valuation of deferred tax assets.

The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the Audit Committee. 
 Allowance for Customer Credit Losses 
 
The Company evaluates 
the collectability 
of customer 
accounts receivable 
and records 
an allowance 
 for customer 
credit losses 
based on 
the accounts 
receivable aging and 
estimates of 
actual write-offs. 
The 
 allowance is 
reviewed for 
adequacy and 
adjusted, as 
necessary, 
on a 
quarterly basis. 
The Company 
also 
 provides 
for 
estimated 
uncollectible 
late 
fees 
charged 
based 
on 
historical 
write-offs. 
The 
Company s 
 financial results 
can be 
impacted by 
changes in 
customer loss 
write-off experience 
and the 
aging of 
the 
 accounts receivable portfolio. 

Merchandise Inventories 
 
The Company s 
inventory is 
valued using 
the weighted-average 
cost method 
and is 
stated at 
the net 
 realizable value. Physical inventories 
are conducted throughout the 
year to calculate actual 
shrinkage and 
 inventory on 
hand. Estimates 
based on 
actual shrinkage results 
are used 
to estimate 
inventory shrinkage, 
 which is 
accrued for 
the period 
between the 
last physical 
inventory and 
the financial 
reporting date. 
The 
 Company 
regularly 
reviews 
its 
inventory 
levels 
to 
identify 
slow 
moving 
merchandise 
and 
uses 
 markdowns to clear slow moving inventory. 

Lease Accounting 
 The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has operating 
 leases for 
stores, 
offices, 
warehouse space 
and equipment. 
Its leases 
have remaining 
lease terms 
of 
one 
 year to 10 years, some of which 
include options to extend the lease term for 
up to five years, and some of 
 which 
include 
options 
to 
terminate 
the 
lease 
within 
one 
year. 
The 
Company considers 
these 
options 
in 
 determining 
the 
lease term 
used 
to 
establish its 
right-of-use assets 
and lease 
liabilities. The 
Company s 
 lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material 
restrictive covenants. 
 As 
most 
of 
the 
Company s 
leases 
do 
not 
provide 
an 
implicit 
rate, 
the 
Company 
uses 
its 
estimated 
 incremental 
borrowing 
rate 
based 
on 
the 
information 
available 
at 
commencement 
date 
of 
the 
lease 
in 
 determining the present value of lease payments. 
See Note 11 for further information. 
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
The 
Company invests 
in 
leaseholds, 
right-of use 
assets 
and 
equipment primarily 
in 
connection 
with 
 the opening and remodeling of stores 
and in computer software and hardware. The 
Company periodically 
 reviews its store 
locations and estimates 
the recoverability of 
its long-lived assets, 
which primarily relate 
 to 
Fixtures 
and 
equipment, 
Leasehold 
improvements, 
Right-of-use 
assets 
net 
of 
Lease 
liabilities 
and 
 Information 
technology 
equipment 
and 
software. 
An 
impairment 
charge 
is 
recorded 
for 
the 
amount 
by 
 which the 
carrying value 
exceeds the 
estimated fair 
value when 
the Company 
determines that 
projected 
 cash flows associated with those long-lived assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value. 
This 
 determination is based on a 
number of factors, including the store s 
historical operating results and future 
 projected cash flows, which include contribution margin projections. The Company assesses the fair value 
 of each lease 
by considering market 
rents and 
any lease terms 
that may adjust 
market rents under 
certain 
 conditions, such as the loss of 
an anchor tenant or a leased 
space in a shopping center not 
meeting certain 
 criteria. Further, 
in determining when 
to close a 
store, the Company considers 
real estate development 
in 
 the 
area and 
perceived local 
market conditions, 
which can 
be difficult 
to 
predict and 
may be 
subject 
to 
 change. 
 
Insurance Liabilities 
 
The 
Company 
is 
primarily 
self-insured 
for 
healthcare, 
workers 
compensation 
and 
general 
liability 
 costs. These costs are 
significant primarily due to the 
large number of the 
Company s retail locations 
and 
 associates. The Company s 
self-insurance liabilities are 
based on the 
total estimated costs 
of claims filed 

31
 and 
estimates 
of 
claims 
incurred 
but 
not 
reported, 
less 
amounts 
paid 
against 
such 
claims, 
and 
are 
not 
 discounted. 
Management 
reviews 
current 
and 
historical 
claims 
data 
in 
developing 
its 
estimates. 
The 
 Company 
also 
uses 
information 
provided 
by 
outside 
actuaries 
with 
respect 
to 
healthcare, 
workers 
 compensation and general liability claims. 
If the underlying facts and 
circumstances of the claims change 
 or 
the 
historical 
experience 
upon 
which 
insurance 
provisions 
are 
recorded 
is 
not 
indicative 
of 
future 
 trends, then 
the Company 
may be 
required to 
make adjustments 
to the 
provision for 
insurance costs 
that 
 could 
be 
material 
to 
the 
Company s 
reported 
financial condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. 
Historically, 
 actual results have not significantly deviated from estimates. 
 
Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
The Company records 
liabilities for 
uncertain tax 
positions primarily 
related to 
state income 
taxes as 
 of the balance sheet 
date. 
These liabilities reflect the 
Company s best 
estimate of its ultimate 
income tax 
 liability 
based 
on 
the 
tax 
codes, 
regulations, 
and 
pronouncements 
of 
the 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
we 
do 
 business. 
Estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the 
application of 
 complex tax 
regulations across 
many jurisdictions. 
Despite the 
Company s 
belief that 
the estimates 
and 
 judgments 
are 
reasonable, 
differences 
between 
the 
estimated 
and 
actual 
tax 
liabilities 
can 
and 
do 
exist 
 from time to time. 
These differences may arise from settlements 
of tax audits, expiration of the statute of 
 limitations, and the evolution and application of the 
various jurisdictional tax codes and regulations. 
Any 
 differences will 
be recorded 
in the 
period in 
which they become 
known and 
could have 
a material 
effect 
 on the results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded. 
 
Deferred Tax Valuation 
Allowance 
 
The 
Company 
assesses 
the 
likelihood 
that 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
will 
be 
realized 
in 
light 
of 
the 
 Company s 
current 
financial 
performance 
and 
projected 
future 
financial 
performance. 
Based 
on 
this 
 assessment, the 
Company then 
determines if 
a valuation 
allowance should 
be recorded. 
If the 
Company 
 concludes 
that 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
not 
that 
the 
Company 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
realize 
its 
tax 
deferred 
 assets, a valuation allowance is recorded for the proportion of the deferred tax asset it determines may not 
 be realized. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk 
 
The Company 
believes that 
its cash, 
cash equivalents 
and short-term 
investments, together 
with cash 
 flows from operations, will be 
adequate to fund the Company s 
regular operating requirements, including 
 71.9 million 
of lease 
obligations and 
planned investments 
of 
 22.1 million 
of capital 
expenditures, 
for 
 fiscal 2023 and for the foreseeable future. 

Cash 
provided 
by 
operating 
activities 
during 
fiscal 
2022 
was 
 13.4 
million 
as 
compared 
to 
 59.8 million provided 
in fiscal 
2021 and 
 30.7 million 
used in 
fiscal 2020. 
Cash provided 
by operating 
 activities 
during 
2022 
was 
primarily 
attributable 
to 
net 
income 
adjusted 
for 
depreciation, 
share-based 
 compensation, impairment and 
changes in working 
capital. The decrease 
of 46.4 million 
for fiscal 2022 
 compared to 
fiscal 2021 
is primarily due 
to lower net 
operating income and 
a decrease in 
accounts payable 
 and accrued bonus and benefits, partially offset 
by lower accounts receivable and merchandise 
inventories. 
 
At January 
28, 2023, 
the Company 
had working 
capital of 
 74.7 million compared 
to 111.5 
million 
 and 
 108.6 
million 
at 
January 
29, 
2022 
and 
January 
30, 
2021, 
respectively. 
The 
decrease in 
working 
 capital 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year 
is 
primarily 
due 
to 
lower 
short-term 
investments 
and 
lower 
inventory, 
 partially offset by lower accounts payable 
and accrued bonus and benefits. 

At January 28, 
2023, the Company 
had an 
unsecured revolving credit 
agreement, which provided 
for 
 borrowings of 
up to 
 35.0 million less 
the 
balance of 
any revocable 
letters of 
credit related 
to 
purchase 
 commitments, 
and 
was 
committed 
through 
May 
2027. 
The 
credit 
agreement 
contains 
various 
financial 
 covenants and limitations, including the maintenance of specific financial 
ratios with which the Company 
 was in compliance as of January 28, 2023. There were no borrowings 
outstanding under this credit facility 

32
 as of the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023 or the fiscal year ended 
January 29, 2022. 

The 
Company 
had 
no 
outstanding 
revocable 
letters 
of 
credit 
relating 
to 
purchase 
commitments 
at 
 January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021. 

Expenditures 
for 
property 
and 
equipment 
totaled 
 19.4 
million, 
 4.1 
million 
and 
 14.0 
million 
in 
 fiscal 2022, 
2021 and 
2020, respectively. 
The 
expenditures for 
fiscal 2022 
were primarily 
for additional 
 investments in 19 new stores, distribution 
center and information technology. 

Net 
cash 
provided 
by 
investing 
activities 
totaled 
 16.0 
million 
for 
fiscal 
2022 
compared 
to 
 25.3 
 million used in 
fiscal 2021 and 
 64.5 million provided 
for fiscal 
2020. 
In fiscal 2022, 
the cash 
provided 
 was 
primarily 
attributable 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
net 
sales 
of 
short-term 
investments, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 expenditures for property and equipment. 
 
Net cash used by financing activities totaled 29.3 million in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash used of 
 31.8 million 
for fiscal 
2021 and 
 27.2 million 
for fiscal 
2020. 
The decrease in cash used was 
primarily 
 due to lower share repurchase amounts, 
partially offset by higher dividend payments. 
 
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments.

regarding 
the 
Company s

asset-backed securities have 
contractual 
 maturities which 
range from 
six 
days to 
3.9 years. 
The U.S. 
Treasury 
Notes have 
contractual maturities 
 which 
range 
from 
three 
days 
to 
1.6 
years. 
These 
securities are 
classified as 
available-for-sale and 
are 
 recorded as 
Short-term investments, 
Restricted cash, 
Restricted short-term 
investments and 
Other assets 
on 
 the accompanying 
Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. These 
assets are 
carried at 
fair value 
with unrealized 
gains 
 and losses reported net of taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The asset-backed securities are 
 bonds 
comprised 
of 
auto 
loans 
and 
bank 
credit 
cards 
that 
carry 
AAA 
ratings. 
The 
auto 
loan 
asset-backed 
 securities are 
backed by 
static pools 
of auto 
loans that 
were originated 
and serviced 
by captive 
auto finance 
 units, 
banks 
or 
finance 
companies. 
The 
bank

generated 
by

of 
cards 
from 
American

Additionally, 
at 
January 
28, 
2023, 
the 
Company 
had 
 0.9 
million 
of 
corporate 
equities, 
which 
are 
 recorded within Other assets in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
At January 29, 2022, the Company had 
 0.8 
million 
of 
corporate 
equities, 
which 
are 
recorded 
within 
Other 
assets 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
 Sheets. 

Level 
1 
category 
securities 
are 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
using 
quoted 
active 
market 
prices. 
Level 
2 
 investment securities include corporate and municipal bonds for which quoted prices may 
not be available on 
 active exchanges for identical instruments. 
Their fair value is principally based on market values determined 
 by 
management 
with 
assistance 
of a 
third-party 
pricing 
service. 
Since quoted 
prices 
in 
active 
markets for 
 identical assets are 
not available, these 
prices are determined 
by the pricing 
service using observable 
market 
 information 
such 
as 
quotes 
from 
less 
active 
markets 
and/or 
quoted 
prices 
of 
securities 
with 
similar 
 characteristics, among other factors. 
 Deferred 
compensation plan 
assets 
consist 
primarily of 
life 
insurance 
policies. These 
life 
insurance 
 policies are valued based on the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based 
 on 
such 
factors 
as 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
underlying 
assets 
and 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
and 
are 
therefore 
 classified 
within 
Level 
3 
of 
the 
valuation 
hierarchy. 
The 
Level

liability 
associated 
with 
the 
life 
 insurance 
policies 
represents 
a 
deferred 
compensation 
obligation, 
the 
value 
of 
which 
is 
tracked 
via

 underlying 
insurance 
funds 
net 
asset 
values, 
as 
recorded 
in 
Other 
noncurrent 
liabilities 
in 
the 
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. These 
funds are designed 
to mirror the 
return of existing 
mutual funds and

 Contractual Obligations 
 
Contractual 
obligations 
for 
future 
payments 
at 
January 
28, 
2023 
relate 
primarily 
to 
operating 
lease 
 commitments for 
store leases. 
Operating leases 
represent minimum 
required lease 
payments under 
non-
 cancellable 
lease 
terms. 
Most 
store

also 
require 
payment

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To the
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Cato Corporation
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Cato Corporation and its 
 subsidiaries (the Company as of January 28, 2023 and 
January 29, 2022, and the related consolidated 
 statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders 
equity and of cash flows 
 for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2023, including 
the related notes and financial 
 statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred 
to as the consolidated 
 financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
 January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 
(2013) issued 
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material 
 respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2023 
and January 29, 2022, and the 
 results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended January 28, 2023 
 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Also in our 
 opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control 
over financial 
 reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria established in 
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
 Basis for Opinions
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial 
statements, for maintaining 
 effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
 control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial 
 Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions 
on the Company s 
 consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over 
financial reporting based on 
 our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
 Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with 
respect to the Company in 
 accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules 
and regulations of the Securities 
 and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
 we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial 
 statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, 
and whether effective internal 
 control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing 
procedures to assess the risks of 
 material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to error or fraud, and 
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures 
included examining, on a test basis, 
 evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. Our audits also 
 included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as 
 well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. Our audit of internal 
 control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial 
 reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and 
 operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits 
also included performing 
 such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits 
 provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
 assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for 

36
 external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company s internal 
 control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (i) pertain to the maintenance 
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the 
 assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to 
 permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, 
 and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations 
 of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
 or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company s assets that could 
 have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect 
 misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods 
are subject to the risk 
 that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance 
 with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 Critical Audit Matters
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising 
from the current period audit of the 
 consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to 
be communicated to the audit 
 committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material 
to the consolidated financial 
 statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or 
complex judgments. The 
 communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on 
the consolidated
 financial 
 statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating 
the critical audit matter below, providing a 
 separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or 
disclosures to which it relates.
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Store Location Asset Groupings 
 As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, 
the Company s consolidated 
 property and equipment, net balance was 70.4 million, of which the store 
locations were a portion, and 
 consolidated operating lease right-of-use assets, net balance was 174.3 
million as of January 28, 2023. 
 The Company invests in leaseholds, right-of-use assets and equipment, 
primarily in connection with the 
 opening and remodeling of stores, and in computer software and hardware. 
The Company periodically 
 reviews its store locations and estimates the recoverability of its 
long-lived assets, which primarily relate 
 to fixtures and equipment, leasehold improvements, right-of-use assets net 
of lease liabilities, and 
 information technology equipment and software. An impairment 
charge is recorded for the amount by 
 which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value when management 
determines that projected 
 cash flows associated with those long-lived assets will not be sufficient to recover 
the carrying value. This 
 determination is based on a number of factors, including the store s historical operating results and future 
 projected cash flows, which include contribution margin projections. The Company 
assesses the fair value 
 of each lease by considering market rents and any lease terms 
that may adjust market rents under certain 
 conditions such as the loss of an anchor tenant or a leased space in a shopping 
center not meeting certain 
 criteria. An impairment charge for store assets of 0.9 million was recorded during 
the year ended 
 January 28, 2023.
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing 
procedures relating to the impairment 
 of long-lived assets store location asset groupings is a critical audit matter 
are (i) the significant 
 judgment by management when determining the fair value measurement 
of the store location asset 
 groupings, which led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing 
 procedures and evaluating management s projected cash flow assumptions related to contribution margin 
 projections. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating 
audit evidence in connection with 
 forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing 
 the effectiveness of controls relating to management s long-lived assets store location recoverability test 
 and determination of the fair value of the asset group. These procedures 
also included, among others (i) 
 testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the projected 
cash flows and store 

37
 location asset groupings, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions related to 
 contribution margin projections by considering current and historical performance 
of the store location 
 asset groupings and whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence 
obtained in other areas of the 
 audit, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the projected cash flow model, 
and (iv) evaluating 
 management s assessment of the fair value of the leased assets included in the store location asset 
 groupings.

 investment securities include corporate and municipal bonds for which quoted prices may 
not be available on 
 active exchanges for identical instruments. 
Their fair value is principally based on market values determined 
 by 
management 
with 
assistance 
of a 
third-party 
pricing 
service. 
Since quoted 
prices 
in 
active 
markets for 
 identical assets are

prices are determined 
by the pricing 
service using observable

 information 
such

Deferred

plan 
assets 
consist 
primarily 
of

These

 on 
such 
factors 
as 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
underlying

million of state tax credits to offset future state income tax 
 expense, which are set to expire 
by fiscal 2023. 
Based on the available evidence, the 
Company has recorded 
 a valuation allowance of 

million.
 
As of 
January 
28, 
2023, 
the 
Company 
had 

million 
of 
state net 
operating 
loss 
carryforwards. 
The 
 Company assessed the likelihood that deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards will 
 be realized. 
Based on 
this assessment, the 
Company concluded 
that it is 
more likely 
than not the 
Company 
 will not be 
able to realize 

million of the 
net operating losses 
and, accordingly, has 
recorded a valuation 
 allowance for the same amount.
 The net change 
in the valuation 
allowance 
for the years 
ended January 28, 2023 and January 29, 
2022 is 
 due to state net operating losses and 
state tax credits.

As 
of 
January

the 
Company s 
position 
is 
that 
its

not
