PART
I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Purpose
and History 

Our
business is focused on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market
is underserved because of the lack of traditional lenders currently fully participating in the market. We were originally formed as a
Pennsylvania limited liability company on May 10, 2007. To meet our business objectives, we changed our name to Shepherd s Finance,
LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida.
As used in this report, we, us, our, and Company refer to Shepherd s Finance,
LLC. We have an internet website at www.shepherdsfinance.com . We are not incorporating by reference into this report any material
from our website. The reference to our website is an inactive textual reference to the uniform resource locator (URL) and is for reference
only. 

The
commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium
sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In some circumstances, the lot is purchased with
an older home on the lot which is then either removed or rehabilitated. If the home is rehabilitated, the loan is referred to as a rehab 
loan. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of lots and undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential
building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position and the opportunities available to us, do neither or either of the
following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate
or other collateral), and purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount. 

3 

Experience
and Resources 

Our
Chief Executive Officer CEO ), Mr. Wallach, has been in the housing industry since 1985. He was the Chief Financial Officer
of a multi-billion-dollar supplier of building materials to home builders for 12 years. He also was responsible for that company s
lending business for 20 years. During those years, he was responsible for the creation and implementation of many secured lending programs
to builders. Some of these were performed fully by that company, and some were performed in partnership with banks. In general, the creation
of all loans, and the resolution of defaulted loans, was his responsibility, whether the loans were company loans or loans in partnership
with banks. Through these programs, he was responsible for the creation of approximately 2,000,000,000 in loans which generated interest
spread of 50,000,000, after deducting for loan losses. Through the years, he managed the development of systems for reducing and managing
the risks and losses on defaulted loans. Mr. Wallach also was responsible for that company s unsecured debt to builders, which
reached over 300,000,000 at its peak. He also gained experience in securing defaulted unsecured debt. 

In
addition, our Executive Vice President of Operations has 17 years of experience in this type of lending. Our Chief Financial Officer CFO has 17 years of SEC registrant accounting experience. Our Executive Vice President has been in the housing industry
for over 38 years including holding executive level positions for the majority of that time. Our Executive Vice President of Sales was
appointed in April 2021 and has over 20 years of experience in the construction finance industry. 

Human
Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have retained 20 employees (three of which are lending representatives) including our CEO. The development,
attraction, and retention of employees is a strong focus for the Company, as is fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy corporate
culture. Additionally, as described in more detail elsewhere in this report, we have an executive compensation program designed to attract,
retain, and motivate highly talented executives and to align each executive s incentives with our short-term and long-term objectives,
while maintaining a healthy and stable financial position. 

Opportunity,
Strategy, and Approach 

Background
and Strategy 

Finance
markets are highly fragmented, with numerous large, mid-size, and small lenders and investment companies, such as banks, savings and
loan associations, credit unions, insurance companies, and institutional lenders, all competing for investment opportunities. Many of
these market participants experienced losses, as a result of the housing market (which started to decline in 2006, reached its bottom
in 2008, improved through early 2022, then declined through the fall of 2022, and since has been relatively stable nationally), and their
participation in lending in it. As a result of credit losses and restrictive government oversight, the financial institutions are not
participating in this market to the extent they had before the 2008 credit crisis. Nonregulated builder focused lenders (of which we
are one) have increased their presence since 2008. Our goal is not to be a customer s only source of commercial lending, but an
extra, more user-friendly piece of their financing. 

Our
loans are marketed by lending representatives who work for us and are driven to maintain long-term customer relationships. Compensation
for loan originators is focused on the profitability of loans originated, not simply the volume of loans originated. As of December 31,
2022, we have retained 20 employees (three of which are lending representatives) including our CEO. In his previous experience, our CEO
had a nationwide staff of 20 lenders working in the field. 

Our
efforts are designed to create a loan portfolio that includes some or all of the following investment characteristics: (i) provides current
income; (ii) is well-secured by residential real estate; (iii) is short term in nature; and (iv) provides high interest spreads. 

Our
investment policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of managers. In the years ahead, we plan maintaining or growing
our current level of lending, increasing our geographic diversity, growing our rehab lending program, and improving our financial performance.
We may be adding systems and people to accomplish these goals. 

As
we continue to grow our business, we are focusing some of our efforts on our rehab program, which we believe in the long run will face
less bank competition and have more stable demand than our new construction program. 

4 

Risk
and Mitigation 

We
believe that while creating speculative construction loans is a high-risk venture, the opportunity for margin, the differences in our
lending versus typical small bank lending, and our loss mitigation techniques will all help this to continue to be a profitable business. 

We
engage in various activities to try to mitigate the risks inherent in this type of lending by: 

Keeping
 the loan-to-value ratio LTV ), between 60 and 75 on a portfolio basis, however, individual loans may, from time to
 time, have a greater LTV; 

Generally
 using deposits from the builder on home construction loans to ensure the completion of the home. Lending losses on defaulted loans
 are usually a higher percentage when the home is not built, or is only partially built; 

Having
 a higher yield than other forms of secured real estate lending; 

Using
 interest escrows for some of our loans; 

Aggressively
 working with builders who are in default on their loan before and during foreclosure. This technique generally yields a reduced realized
 loss; and 

Market
 grading. We review all lending markets, analyzing their historic housing start cycles. Then, the current position of housing starts
 is examined in each market. Markets are classified into volatile, average, or stable, and then graded based on that classification
 and our opinion of where the market is in its housing cycle. This grading is then used to determine the builder deposit amount, LTV,
 and how much of the lot purchase the builder is required to fund. 

The
following table contains items that we believe differentiate us from our competitors: 

Item 
 
 Our
 Methods 
 
 Comments 
 
 Lending
 Regulation 
 
 We
 follow various state and federal laws, but are not regulated and controlled by bank examiners from the government. We follow best
 practices we have learned through our experience, some of which are required of banks. 
 
 For
 instance, banks are not required to buy title insurance by law, but typically banks do purchase title insurance for the properties
 on which they lend. We generally do not, as it is very difficult to collect on title policies. Instead, we use title searches to
 protect our interests. 

FDIC
 Insurance 
 
 We
 do not offer FDIC insurance to our unsecured notes investors. 
 
 Our
 yield to our customers, and our cost of funds, is typically higher than that of most banks. We charge our borrowers higher interest
 rates than do most banks. We also save money by not paying for FDIC insurance. 

Capital
 Structure 
 
 Typically,
 our unsecured notes offered through our notes program are due in one to four years, or when the Note matures. 
 
 This
 results in liquidity risk (i.e., funding borrowing requests or maturities of debt). Our assets typically turnover much quicker (about
 4 times faster) than our average unsecured debt does, and our unsecured debt is mostly prepayable. These items help keep liquidity
 stable. 

Community
 Reinvestment Act (CRA) (1) 
 
 We
 do not participate in the CRA. 
 
 Our
 sole purpose in making each individual loan is to maximize our returns while maintaining proper risk management. 

Leverage 
 
 We
 try to maintain a 15 ratio of equity (including redeemable preferred equity) to loan assets. 
 
 Our
 equity to loan assets, net ratio was 13.8 as of December 31, 2022. The higher the percentage, the more potential losses the company
 can absorb without impacting debt holders. 

5 

Product
 Diversification 
 
 We
 generally make loans to builders to purchase lots and/or to construct or rehab homes. 
 
 We
 have extensive experience in our field. 

Geographic
 Diversity 
 
 We
 lend in 21 states as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 We
 believe that this geographic diversity helps in down markets, as not all housing markets decrease at the same rate and time. 

Governmental
 Bailouts 
 
 Most
 likely not eligible. 
 
 We
 are not likely to be eligible for bank bailouts, which have happened periodically. We maintain a better leverage ratio to counter
 this. We received two PPP loans, one in 2020 which was forgiven in 2020 and one in 2021 which was forgiven in 2021, and received
 funds through the federal employee retention tax credit ERTC during 2021. 

Underwriting 
 
 We
 focus on items that, in our experience, tend to predict risk. 
 
 These
 items include using collateral, controlling LTVs, controlling the number of loans in one subdivision, underwriting appraisals, conducting
 property inspections, and maintaining certain files and documents similar to those that a bank might maintain. 

(1) 
 The
 CRA subjects a bank who receives FDIC insurance to regulatory assessment to determine if the bank meets the credit needs of its entire
 community, and to consider that determination in its evaluation of any application made by the bank for, among other things, approval
 of the acquisition or establishment of a bank branch. 

Lines
of Business 

Our
efforts are designed to create a portfolio that includes some or all of the following investment characteristics: (i) provides current
income; (ii) is well-secured by residential real estate; (iii) is short term in nature; and (iv) provides high interest spreads. While
we primarily provide commercial construction loans to homebuilders (for residential real estate), we may also purchase defaulted unsecured
debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate or other collateral), purchase defaulted
secured debt from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we will operate our business. 

Our
investment policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of managers. 

Commercial
Construction Loans to Homebuilders 

We
extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon.
Our customers generally benefit from doing business with us not just because they are able to sell additional homes (which we finance),
but because, as they build additional homes, they are able to increase sales of homes that are built as contracted homes, where the eventual
home owner obtains the loan. Builders generally have more success selling homes when a model or spec home is available for customers
to see. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential building
lots. In addition, we lend money to purchase and rehabilitate older existing homes. Most of the loans are for spec homes 
or spec lots, meaning they are built or developed speculatively (with no specific end-user home owner in mind). 

In
a typical home construction transaction, a homebuilder obtains a loan to purchase a lot and build a home on that lot. In some cases,
the builder has a contract with a customer to purchase the home upon its completion. In other cases, the home is built as a spec home,
but the homebuilder believes it will sell before or shortly after completion, and therefore, building the home before it is under contract
will increase the homebuilder s sales and profitability. The builder may also believe that the construction of a spec home will
increase the number of contract sales the homebuilder will have in a given year, as it may be easier to sell contract homes when the
customer can see the builder s work in the spec home. In some cases, these speculatively built homes are constructed with the intention
to keep them as a model for a period of time, to increase contract sales, and then be sold. These are called model homes. While we may
lend to a homebuilder for any of these types of new construction homes, through December 31, 2022, about 80 of our construction loans
have been spec homes and 20 have been contracts. 

6 

In
a typical rehab transaction, we fund all of the purchase price, and then all or a portion of the cost to complete the project. In some
circumstances, we are unable to see the inside of the home prior to closing, so we assume that anything from drywall to completion needs
to be redone, as well as what we can see from the outside. Because we are flexible in our need to see the inside of the home, and we
only use experienced builders as customers for this type of lending, we believe that this differentiates us from banks. 

We
fund the loans that we originate using available cash resources that are generated primarily from borrowings, our loan purchase and sale
agreements, proceeds from the fixed rate subordinated notes Notes offered pursuant to our public offering Notes
Program ), equity, and net operating cash flow. We intend to continue funding loans we originate using the same sources. 

There
is a seasonal aspect to home construction, and this affects our monthly cash flow. In general, since the home construction loans we create
will last less than a year on average, and since we are geographically diverse, the seasonality impact is somewhat mitigated. 

Generally,
our real estate loans are secured by one or more of the following: 

the
 parcels of land to be developed; 

finished
 lots; 

new
 or rehabbed single-family homes; and/or 

in
 most cases, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower entity. 

Most

2023
Outlook 

During
2023, the housing market in most of the areas in which we do business will likely decline as compared to the same period of time in 2022
due to the impact of current economic conditions and reactions by the Federal Reserve Bank. While markets will probably weaken compared
to where they were during 2022, we anticipate losses incurred in principal related to COVID-19 will decrease, and the lower interest
income due to nonperforming assets will continue to decrease during 2023 as compared to 2022. Short term interest rates are expected
to continue to rise. Mortgage rates peaked mid-2022 and have declined since. A continued rise in short term rates is likely to benefit
the company as our competitors rates will rise faster than ours making us more competitive, but an additional rise in long term
interest rates would negatively impact the housing industry as a whole, and therefore us.

Commercial
Loans Real Estate Development Loan Portfolio Summary 

In
a typical development transaction, a homebuilder/developer purchases a specific parcel or parcels of land. Developers must secure financing
in order to pay the purchase price for the land as well as to pay expenses incurred while developing the lots. This is the financing
we provide. Once financing has been secured, the lot developers create individual lots. Developers secure permits allowing the property
to be developed and then design and build roads and utility systems for water, sewer, gas, and electricity to service the property. The
individual lots are then sold before a home is built on them; paid off, built on and then sold; or built on, then sold and paid off (in
these cases, we may subordinate our loan to the home construction loan).

Credit
Quality Information 

See
the notes to our financial statements for credit quality information. 

Competition 

Historically,
our industry has been highly competitive. We compete for opportunities with numerous public and private investment vehicles, including
financial institutions, specialty finance companies, mortgage banks, pension funds, opportunity funds, hedge funds, REITs, and other
institutional investors, as well as individuals. Many competitors are significantly larger than us, have well-established operating histories
and may have greater access to capital, resources and other advantages over us. These competitors may be willing to accept lower returns
on their investments or to modify underwriting standards and, as a result, our origination volume and profit margins could be adversely
affected. 

We
believe that this is a good time to extend commercial loans to builders in the residential real estate market because this market appears
underserved. We expect our loans to be different than other lenders in the markets in which we are active. Typically, the differences
are: 

our
 loans may have a higher fee; 

our
 loans typically require a small deposit which is refundable, versus a large upfront payment for the lot which is not refundable;
 and 

some
 of our loans may have lower costs as a result of not requiring title insurance. 

Regulatory
Matters 

Financial
Regulation 

Our
operations are not subject to the stringent regulatory requirements imposed upon the operations of commercial banks, savings banks, and
thrift institutions. We are not subject to periodic compliance examinations by federal or state banking regulators. Further, our Notes
are not certificates of deposit or similar obligations or guaranteed by any depository institution and are not insured by the FDIC or
any governmental or private insurance fund, or any other entity. 

The
Investment Company Act of 1940 

An
investment company is defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), to include
any issuer engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Absent an exemption, investment companies
are required to register as such with the SEC and to comply with various governance and operational requirements. If we were considered
an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to numerous requirements and
restrictions relating to our structure and operation. If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act and to comply with these requirements and restrictions, we may have to make significant changes in our structure and operations to
comply with exemption from registration, which could adversely affect our business. Such changes may include, for example, limiting the
range of assets in which we may invest. We intend to conduct our operations so as to fit within an exemption from registration under
the Investment Company Act for purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate. In order to
satisfy the requirements of such exemption, we may need to restrict the scope of our operations. 

11 

Environmental
Compliance 

We
do not believe that compliance with federal, state, or local laws relating to the protection of the environment will have a material
effect on our business in the foreseeable future. However, loans we extend or purchase are secured by real property. In the course of
our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate that could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to
these properties. We (or our loan customers) may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal
injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required
to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical release at a property. The costs associated with the investigation
or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we become the owner of or discover that we were formerly the owner of
a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third-parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from the property. To date, we have not incurred any significant costs related to environmental compliance and
we do not anticipate incurring any significant costs for environmental compliance in the future. Generally, when we are lending on property
which is being developed into single family building lots, an environmental assessment is done by the builder for the various governmental
agencies. When we lend for new construction on newly developed lots, the lots have generally been reviewed while they were being developed.
We also perform our own physical inspection of the lot, which includes assessing potential environmental issues. Before we take possession
of a property through foreclosure, we again assess the property for possible environmental concerns, which, if deemed to be a significant
risk compared to the value of the property, could cause us to forego foreclosure on the property and to seek other avenues for collection. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Below
are risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operations that we believe are material to investors. Other risks and uncertainties
may exist that we do not consider material based on the information currently available to us at this time. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

Our
business is not industry-diversified. Deterioration in the homebuilding industry or economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19,
could decrease demand and pricing for new homes and residential home lots. A decline in housing values similar to the national downturn
in the real estate market that began in 2007 would have a negative impact on our business. Smaller value declines will also have a negative
impact on our business. These factors may decrease the likelihood we will be able to generate enough cash to repay the Notes. 

Developers
and homebuilders to whom we may make loans use the proceeds of our loans to develop raw land into residential home lots and construct
homes. The developers obtain the money to repay our development loans by selling the residential home lots to homebuilders or individuals
who will build single-family residences on the lots, or by obtaining replacement financing from other lenders. A developer s ability
to repay our loans is based primarily on the amount of money generated by the developer s sale of its inventory of single-family
residential lots. Homebuilders obtain the money to repay our loans by selling the homes they construct or by obtaining replacement financing
from other lenders, and thus, the homebuilders ability to repay our loans is based primarily on the amount of money generated
by the sale of such homes. 

The
homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in industry conditions, as well as in general and local economic
conditions, such as: 

employment
 level and job growth; 

demographic
 trends, including population increases and decreases and household formation; 

availability
 of financing for homebuyers; 

interest
 rates; 

affordability
 of homes; 

consumer
 confidence; 

levels
 of new and existing homes for sale, including foreclosed homes and homes held by investors and speculators; and 

housing
 demand generally. 

12 

These
conditions may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others. 

We
generally lend a percentage of the values of the homes and lots. These values are determined shortly prior to the lending. If the values
of homes and lots in markets in which we lend drop fast enough to cause the builders losses that are greater than their equity in the
property, we will be forced to liquidate the loan in a fashion which will cause us to lose money. If these losses when combined and added
to our other expenses are greater than our revenue from interest charged to our customers, we will lose money overall, which will hurt
our ability to pay interest and principal on the Notes. Values are typically affected by demand for homes, which can change due to many
factors, including but not limited to, demographics, interest rates, the overall economy, which can be impacted by outbreaks of communicable
illnesses, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, cost of building materials and labor, availability of financing for end-users, inventory
of homes available and governmental action or inaction. If there is a tightening of the credit markets, it would be more difficult for
potential homeowners to obtain financing to purchase homes. If housing prices decline or sales in the housing market decline, our customers
may have a hard time selling their homes at a profit. This could cause the amount of defaulted loans that we will own to increase. An
increase in defaulted loans would reduce our revenue and could lead to losses on our loans. A decline in housing prices will further
increase our losses on defaulted loans. If the amount of defaulted loans or the loss per defaulted loan is large enough, we will operate
at a loss, which will decrease our equity. This could cause us to become insolvent, and we will not be able to pay back Note holders 
principal and interest on the Notes. 

We
face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 pandemic), which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects. 

We
face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis. COVID-19 has spread globally and the pandemic has caused significant
disruptions to the economy. We have been impacted and continue to face risks related to COVID-19, which has caused disruptions to the
economy and in all of the markets in which we lend. Our operating results depend significantly on the homebuilding industry. The pandemic
may cause decreases in demand for the sales of homes in those areas and others in the future, which could negatively affect our homebuilding
customers and their ability to repay our loans. In such event, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and
prospects could be adversely impacted, including our ability to repay our Notes. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 and its variants, public adoption rates of
vaccines, and the uncertainty of new variants of the virus, among others. As we emerge from the pandemic, housing trends may shift in
a negative direction in some or all of our markets. 

As
a result of the potential impact of COVID-19, we suspended originations of new loans as of March 20, 2020 in order to maintain our liquidity
and based on our expectation that home values would likely decrease in the near future. We initially told all of our borrowers that we
would fund all loans where the underlying home was already under construction, and advised them to build as quickly as possible to bring
the homes on the market as soon as possible. For loans where the borrower had not yet begun construction of the underlying home, we initially
told them that we would not fund construction and they should therefore not start construction. 

On
May 7, 2020, we made the decision to reopen lending under normal, pre-COVID-19 terms for a limited group of certain of our customers.
In addition, the decision was made to allow rehab loans to builders at terms that are less conservative than those established in April
2020 but more conservative than terms prior to the arrival of COVID-19. At that point, we were offering normal terms to approximately
40 of our customers, and restricted terms to approximately 60 of its customers. In the second half of 2020, we slowly increased the
percentage of customers with normal terms to near 100 by the end of the year. The initial negative impact of COVID-19 can be seen in
our financial statements, predominantly in 2020. 

Due
to the continued cases of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still economic uncertainties that could negatively impact net income (loss).
Other financial impacts could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time. 

13 

The
homebuilding industry could experience adverse conditions, and the industry s implementation of strategies in response to such
conditions may not be successful. 

The
United States homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn beginning in 2007. During the course of the downturn, many homebuilders
focused on generating positive operating cash flow, resizing and reshaping their product for a more price-conscious consumer and adjusting
finished new home inventories to meet demand, and did so in many cases by significantly reducing the new home prices and increasing the
level of sales incentives. Notwithstanding these strategies, homebuilders continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract
cancelations, as many of the factors that affect new sales and cancelation rates are beyond the control of the homebuilding industry.
Although the homebuilding industry has experienced positive gains over the last decade, there can be no assurance that these gains will
continue, and these gains may be impacted if negative economic conditions occur as a result of COVID-19, or if there is a negative impact
on the homebuilding industry s expectations for future home sales. The homebuilding industry could suffer similar, or worse, adverse
conditions in the future. Decreases in new home sales would increase the likelihood of defaults on our loans and, consequently, reduce
our ability to repay Note holders principal and interest on the Notes. 

We
have 56,650,000 of loan assets as of December 31, 2022. A 35 reduction in total collateral value would reduce our earnings and net
worth by 3,478,000. Larger reductions would result in lower earnings and lower net worth. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 56,650,000 of loan assets on our books. These assets are recorded on our balance sheet at the lower of
the loan amount or the value of the collateral after deduction for expected selling expenses. A reduction in the value of the underlying
collateral could result in significant losses. A 35 reduction, for instance, would result in a 3,478,000 loss. Accordingly, our business
is subject to risk of a loss of a portion of our Note holders investments if such a reduction were to occur. 

We
have 8,178,000 of development loan assets as of December 31, 2022, which unlike our construction loans, are long term loans. This longer
duration as well as the nature of collateral (raw ground and lots) creates more risk for that portion of our portfolio. 

We
have 8,178,000 of development loan assets as of December 31, 2022. Development loans are riskier than construction loans for two reasons:
the duration of the loan and the nature of the collateral. The duration (being three to five years as compared to generally less than
one year on construction loans) allows for a greater period of time over which the collateral value could decrease. Also, the collateral
value of development loans is more likely to change in greater percentages than that of built homes. For example, during a 70 reduction
in housing starts, newly completed homes still have value, but lots may be worthless. This added risk to this portion of our portfolio
adds risk to our investors as our net worth would be significantly impacted by losses. 

Currently,
we are reliant on a single developer and homebuilder, the Hoskins Group, who is concentrated in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania market,
for a significant portion of our revenues and a portion of our capital. Our second largest customer is in the Cape Coral, Florida market
and is also a significant portion of our portfolio. 

As
of December 31, 2022, 26.6 of our outstanding loan commitments consisted of loans made to Benjamin Marcus Homes, LLC and
Investor s Mark Acquisitions, LLC, both of which are owned by Mark Hoskins (collectively all three parties are referred to
herein as the Hoskins Group ). We refer to the loans to the Hoskins Group as the Pennsylvania Loans. The
Hoskins Group is concentrated in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania market. Prior to March 3, 2023, the Hoskins Group also had a preferred
equity interest in us, and in January 2021 we invested approximately 500,000 in Series A Preferred Units in Benjamin Marcus Homes,
LLC. During 2022, 62,000 of dividend income was earned related to the Series A Preferred Units investment. See Note 14, Subsequent
Events, to our consolidated financial statements. 

Currently,
we are reliant upon a single developer and homebuilder who is concentrated in a single city, for a significant portion of our revenues
and a portion of our capital. Any event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or general downturn in the business of this developer and homebuilder
or in the Pittsburgh housing market generally will have a substantial adverse financial impact on our business and our ability to pay
back Note holders investments in the Notes in the long term. Adverse conditions affecting the local housing market could include,
but are not limited to, declines in new housing starts, declines in new home prices, declines in new home sales, increases in the supply
of available building lots or built homes available for sale, increases in unemployment, and unfavorable demographic changes. One of
our independent managers, Gregory L. Sheldon, also serves an advisor to the Hoskins Group and, consequently, Mr. Sheldon may face conflicts
of interest in the advice that he provides to us and the Hoskins Group, including if any such adverse condition were to materialize.

In
addition, as of December 31, 2022, 9 of our outstanding loan commitments consisted of loans made to our second largest customer, in
Cape Coral, Florida. 

We
have foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2022, which unlike our loans, are recorded on our balance sheet at the value of the collateral,
net of estimated selling expenses. 

We
have foreclosed assets as of December 31, 2022. A reduction in the value of the underlying collateral of our foreclosed assets could
result in significant losses. For example, a 35 reduction in the value of the underlying collateral (net of estimated selling expenses)
would result in a 554,000 loss. Our business is subject to increased risk of not being able to repay timely our Note holders 
investments if such a reduction were to occur. 

Increases
in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability, or increases in other costs of home ownership could prevent potential customers
from buying new homes and adversely affect our business and financial results. 

Most
new home purchasers finance their home purchases through lenders providing mortgage financing. Immediately prior to 2007, interest rates
were at historically low levels and a variety of mortgage products were available. As a result, home ownership became more accessible.
The mortgage products available included features that allowed buyers to obtain financing for a significant portion or all of the purchase
price of the home, had very limited underwriting requirements or provided for lower initial monthly payments. Accordingly, more people
were qualified for mortgage financing. 

Since
2007, the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability, beginning with increased defaults on subprime loans and
other nonconforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment requirements and further defaults. This, in turn,
resulted in a decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related securities. Lenders, regulators and others questioned the
adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs offered in those years. Credit requirements
tightened, and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities declined. In general, fewer loan products, tighter loan
qualifications, and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans make it more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of
homes. These factors served to reduce the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult to sell to first-time and move-up buyers. 

Mortgage
rates have risen significantly over the past 18 months and may continue to rise significantly over the next several years. The benefit
of recent trends loosening credit to potential end users of homes may be outweighed by the rise of interest rates for those borrowers,
which might lower demand for new homes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Open Market Committee cut short-term interest
rates to a record low range of 0 to 0.25 . The Federal Reserve increased interest rates during 2022 and has indicated it expects rates
to continue to increase through 2023. 

A
reduction in the demand for new homes may reduce the amount and price of the residential home lots sold by the developers and homebuilders
to which we loan money and/or increase the amount of time such developers and homebuilders must hold the home lots in inventory. These
factors increase the likelihood of defaults on our loans, which would adversely affect our business and consolidated financial results. 

Most
of our assets are commercial construction loans to homebuilders and/or developers which are a higher-than-average credit risk, and therefore
could expose us to higher rates of loan defaults, which could impact our ability to repay amounts owed to Note holders . 

Our
primary business is extending commercial construction loans to homebuilders, along with some loans for land development. These loans
are considered higher risk because the ability to repay depends on the homebuilder s ability to sell a newly built home. These
homes typically are not sold by the homebuilder prior to commencement of construction. Therefore, we may have a higher risk of loan default
among our customers than other commercial lending companies. If we suffer increased loan defaults in any given period, our operations
could be materially adversely affected, and we may have difficulty making our principal and interest payments on the Notes. 

15 

Our
underwriting standards and procedures are more lenient than conventional lenders. 

We
invest in loans with borrowers who will not be required to meet the credit standards of conventional mortgage lenders, which is riskier
than investing in loans made to borrowers who are required to meet those higher credit standards. Because we generally approve loans
more quickly than some other lenders or providers of capital, there may be a risk that the due diligence we perform as part of our underwriting
procedures will not reveal the need for additional precautions. If so, the interest rate that we charge and the collateral that we require
may not adequately protect us or generate adequate returns for the risk undertaken. 

If
we lose or are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be delayed or unable to implement our business plan, which would adversely
affect our ability to repay the Notes. 

We
do not have an employment agreement with any of our employees and cannot guarantee that they will remain affiliated with us. Although
we have purchased key person life insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, we do not have key person insurance on any of our other employees.
If any of our key employees were to cease their affiliation with us, our consolidated operating results could suffer. We believe that
our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to hire and retain additional personnel. We cannot assure our investors that we
will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel, which could hinder our ability to implement our business plan. 

Employee
misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm. 

Our
reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom
we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an
employee were to engage - or be accused of engaging - in illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct
losses from the activity, and in addition we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial
condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators
to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform
employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct,
and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even
unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. 

A
failure in, or breach of, our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors, including as a
result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage
our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. 

We
rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for our business have generally
increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies; the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies
to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including the management and support of a variety of business processes, including
financial transactions and records, personally identifiable information, and customer and investor data; and the increased sophistication
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As customer, public, and regulatory expectations
regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded
and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Certain of our software and technology systems have been developed
internally and may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or disclosure. Our business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems,
or other operating systems and facilities, may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors,
including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunication outages;
natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political
or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. 

16 

Our
business relies on its digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. Although we
have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, and networks and, because the nature of our business
involves the receipt and retention of personal information about our customers, our customers personal accounts may become the
target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse,
loss, or destruction of our customers , or other third parties confidential information. Third parties with whom we do business
or who facilitate our business activities, including intermediaries or vendors that provide service or security solutions for our operations,
and other third parties, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures
of their own systems or capacity constraints. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties
may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. 

While
we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or
security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will
not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because
of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes,
and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain
a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our
protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure
or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks or systems, could
result in regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional
compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, if such
attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. 

We
are susceptible to customer fraud, which could cause us to suffer losses on our loan portfolio. 

Because
most of our customers do not publicly report their financial condition and therefore typically are not required to be audited on a regular
basis, we are susceptible to a customer s fraud, which could cause us to suffer losses on our loan portfolio. The failure of a
customer to accurately report its financial position, compliance with loan covenants, or eligibility for additional borrowings could
result in our providing loans that do not meet our underwriting criteria, defaults in loan payments, and the loss of some or all of the
principal of a particular loan or loans. Customer fraud can come in other forms, including but not limited to fraudulent invoices for
work done, appraisal fraud, and fraud related to inspections done by third parties. 

We
have entered into loan purchase and sale agreements with third parties to sell them portions of some of our loans. This increases our
leverage. While the agreements are intended to increase our profitability, large loan losses and/or idle cash could actually reduce our
profitability, which could impair our ability to pay principal and/or interest on the Notes. 

The
loan purchase and sale agreements we entered into have allowed us to increase our loan assets and debt. If loans that we create have
significant losses, the benefit of larger balances can be outweighed by the additional loan losses. Also, while these transactions are
booked as secured financing, they are not lines of credit. Accordingly, we will have increased our loan balances without increasing our
lines of credit, which can cause a decrease in liquidity. One solution to this liquidity problem is having idle cash for liquidity, which
then could reduce our profitability. If either of these problems is persistent and/or significant, our ability to pay interest and principal
on our Notes may be impaired. 

Additional
competition may decrease our profitability, which would adversely affect our ability to repay the Notes. 

We
may experience increased competition for business from other companies and financial institutions that are willing to extend the same
types of loans that we extend at lower interest rates and/or fees. These competitors also may have substantially greater resources, lower
cost of funds, and a better-established market presence. If these companies increase their marketing efforts to our market niche of borrowers,
or if additional competitors enter our markets, we may be forced to reduce our interest rates and fees in order to maintain or expand
our market share. Any reduction in our interest rates, interest income, or fees could have an adverse impact on our profitability and
our ability to repay the Notes. 

17 

Our
real estate loans are illiquid, which could restrict our ability to respond rapidly to changes in economic conditions. 

The
real estate loans we currently hold and intend to extend are illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell under-performing loans in our
portfolio or respond to changes in economic, financial, investment, and other conditions may be very limited. We cannot predict whether
we will be able to sell any real estate loan for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by
a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to
close the sale of a loan. The relative illiquidity of our loan assets may impair our ability to generate sufficient cash to make required
interest and principal payments on the Notes. 

Our
systems and procedures might be inadequate to handle our potential growth. Failure to successfully improve our systems and procedures
would adversely affect our ability to repay the Notes. 

We
may experience growth that could place a significant strain upon our operational systems and procedures. Initially, all of our computer
systems used electronic spreadsheets and we utilized other methods that a small company would use. Over time, we added a loan document
system which many banks use to produce closing documents for loans. In 2021 we replaced our loan production systems with a new proprietary
system. If any of these systems fail, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and, ultimately, our ability to repay principal and interest on the Notes. 

If
we do not meet the requirements to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to raise new capital will
be harmed. 

If
we do not maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, then it could result in delaying future SEC filings or future offerings. If future SEC filings or future offerings are delayed,
it could have an extreme negative impact on our cash flow causing us to default on our obligations, including on the Notes. 

We
are required to devote resources to comply with various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including Section 404 relating to internal
controls testing, and this may reduce the resources we have available to focus on our core business. 

Pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
or PCAOB, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We may encounter
problems or delays in completing any changes necessary to our internal controls over financial reporting. Among other things, we may
not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section
404. Any failure to comply with the various requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require significant management time and expenses
and divert attention or resources away from our core business. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation
of any requested improvements provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

We
are subject to risk of significant losses on our loans because we do not require our borrowers to insure the title of their collateral
for our loans. 

It
is customary for lenders extending loans secured by real estate to require the borrower to provide title insurance with minimum coverage
amounts set by the lender. We do not require most of our homebuilders to provide title insurance on their collateral for our loans to
them. This represents an additional risk to us as the lender. The homebuilder may have a title problem which normally would be covered
by insurance, but may result in a loss on the loan because insurance proceeds are not available. 

The
collateral securing our real estate loans may not be sufficient to pay back the principal amount in the event of a default by the borrowers. 

In
the event of default, our real estate loan investments are generally dependent entirely on the loan collateral to recover our investment.
Our loan collateral consists primarily of a mortgage on the underlying property. In the event of a default, we may not be able to recover
the premises promptly and the proceeds we receive upon sale of the property may be adversely affected by risks generally related to interests
in real property, including changes in general or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, declines in real estate
values, increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses including energy costs, changes in governmental
rules, regulations and fiscal policies (including environmental legislation), acts of God, and other factors which are beyond our or
our borrowers control. Current market conditions may reduce the proceeds we are able to receive in the event of a foreclosure
on our collateral. Our remedies with respect to the loan collateral may not provide us with a recovery adequate to recover our investment. 

18 

If
a large number of our current and prospective borrowers are unable to repay their loans within a normal average number of months, we
will experience a significant reduction in our income and liquidity, and may not be able to repay the Notes as they become due. 

Construction
loans that we extend are expected to be repaid in a normal average number of months, typically nine months, depending on the size of
the loan. Development loans are expected to last for many years. We have interest paid on a monthly basis, but also charge a fee which
will be earned over the life of the loan. If these loans are repaid over a longer period of time, the amount of income that we receive
on these loans expressed as a percentage of the outstanding loan amount will be reduced, and fewer loans with new fees will be able to
be made, since the cash will not be available. This will reduce our income as a percentage of the Notes, and if this percentage is significantly
reduced it could impair our ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes. 

Our
cost of funds is substantially higher than that of banks. 

Because
we do not offer FDIC insurance, and because we want to grow our Notes Program faster than most banks want to grow their CD base, our
Notes offer significantly higher rates than bank CDs. Our cost of funds is higher than banks cost of funds due to, among other
factors, the higher rate that we pay on our Notes and other sources of financing. This may make it more difficult for us to compete against
banks when they re-join our niche lending market in large numbers. This could result in losses which could impair or eliminate our ability
to pay interest and principal on our outstanding Notes. 

We
are subject to the general market risks associated with real estate construction and development. 

Our
financial performance depends on the successful construction and/or development and sale of the homes and real estate parcels that serve
as security for the loans we make to homebuilders and developers. As a result, we are subject to the general market risks of real estate
construction and development, including weather conditions, the price and availability of materials used in construction of homes and
development of lots, environmental liabilities and zoning laws, and numerous other factors that may materially and adversely affect the
success of the projects. 

Our
operations are not subject to the stringent banking regulatory requirements designed to protect investors, so repayment of Note holders 
investments is completely dependent upon our successful operation of our business. 

Our
operations are not subject to the stringent regulatory requirements imposed upon the operations of commercial banks, savings banks, and
thrift institutions, and are not subject to periodic compliance examinations by federal or state banking regulators. For example, we
will not be well diversified in our product risk, and we cannot benefit from government programs designed to protect regulated financial
institutions. Therefore, an investment in our Notes does not have the regulatory protections that the holder of a demand account or a
certificate of deposit at a bank does. The return on any Notes purchased by a Note holder is completely dependent upon our successful
operations of our business. To the extent that we do not successfully operate our business, our ability to pay interest and principal
on the Notes will be impaired. 

We
are an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws and are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, and are eligible
to take advantage of certain exemptions from, or reduced disclosure obligations relating to, various reporting requirements that are
normally applicable to public companies. 

19 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have
total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more, (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date
of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement, (3) the date on which we become a
 large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common
equity held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal
quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months), or (4) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in
non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are not required to (1) provide
an auditor s attestation report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with new requirements adopted by the PCAOB which require mandatory audit
firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor must provide additional information about the audit
and the issuer s financial statements, (3) comply with new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 (unless the SEC
determines otherwise), (4) provide certain disclosures relating to executive compensation generally required for larger public companies,
or (5) hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. 

Additionally,
the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying
with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies. This means an emerging
growth company can delay adopting certain accounting standards until such standards are otherwise applicable to private companies.
However, we have elected to opt out of such extended transition period, and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107
of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting
standards is irrevocable. 

We
are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties of which we take title. Any resulting environmental remediation
expense may reduce our ability to repay the Notes. 

In
the course of our business, we foreclose and take title to real estate that could be subject to environmental liabilities. We may be
held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred
by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances
or chemical release at any property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition,
as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs
resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities,
our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Risks
Related to Conflicts of Interest 

Our
CEO (who is also on our board of managers) and Executive Vice President will face conflicts of interest as a result of the secured lines
of credit made to us, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of our Note holders. 

We
have two lines of credit from Daniel M. Wallach (our CEO and chairman of the board of managers) and his affiliates, and one line of credit
from William Myrick (our Executive Vice President). The first line of credit has a maximum principal borrowing amount of 1,250,000 and
is payable to Mr. Wallach and his wife, Joyce S. Wallach, as tenants by the entirety (the Wallach LOC ). The second line
of credit has a maximum principal borrowing amount of 250,000 and is payable to the 2007 Daniel M. Wallach Legacy Trust (the Wallach
Trust LOC, and together with the Wallach LOC, the Wallach Affiliate LOCs ). The third line of credit has a maximum
principal borrowing amount of 1,000,000 and is payable to Mr. Myrick (the Myrick LOC ). As of December 31, 2022, there
was no amount outstanding pursuant to the Wallach Trust LOC, with availability on that line of credit of 250,000, there was no amount
outstanding pursuant to the Wallach LOC, with remaining availability on that line of credit of 1,250,000. As of December 31, 2022, the
amount outstanding pursuant to the Myrick LOC was 35,000 with availability on that line of credit of 965,000. The interest rates on
the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and the Myrick LOC generally equal the prime rate plus 3 and were 10.5 as of December 31, 2022. The Wallach
Affiliate LOCs and the Myrick LOC are collateralized by a lien against all of our assets. The Notes are subordinated in right of payment
to all secured debt, including these Wallach Affiliate LOCs and the Myrick LOC. Pursuant to the promissory note for each Wallach Affiliate
LOCs and the Myrick LOC, the lenders have the option of funding any amount up to the face amount of the note, in the lender s sole
and absolute discretion. Therefore, Mr. Wallach and Mr. Myrick will face conflicts of interest in deciding whether and when to exercise
any rights pursuant to the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and Myrick LOC, respectively. If Mr. Wallach or Mr. Myrick exercise their rights to
collect on their collateral upon a default by us, we could lose some or all of our assets, which could have a negative effect on our
ability to repay the Notes. 

20 

As
a result of his large equity ownership in the Company, our CEO will face a conflict of interest in deciding the number of distributions
to equity owners, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of Note holders. 

As
of December 31, 2022, our CEO (who is also on the board of managers) beneficially owned 80.7 of the common equity of the Company. He
and his wife also own 35.5 the Series C cumulative preferred units outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since the Company is taxed as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes, all profits and losses flow through to the equity owners. Therefore, Mr. Wallach and his
affiliated equity owners of the Company will be motivated to distribute profits to the equity owners on an annual basis, rather than
retain earnings in the Company for Company purposes. There is currently no limit in the indenture or otherwise on the amount of funds
that may be distributed by the Company to its equity owners. If substantial funds are distributed to the equity owners, the liquidity
and capital resources of the Company will be reduced and our ability to repay the Notes may be negatively impacted. 

Some
of our employees and managers may face conflicts of interest as a result of their and their relatives investment in the Notes,
which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of our Note holders. 

Employees,
managers, members, and relatives of managers and members have invested in the Notes, in the aggregate amount of 3,974,000 as of December
31, 2022. While investment in the Notes by our affiliates may align their interests with those of other Note holders, it could also create
conflicts of interest by influencing those employees or managers actions during times of financial difficulties. For example,
the fact that certain of our managers hold Notes, and the value of Notes they hold, could influence their decision to redeem Notes at
a time or times when it would be prudent to use our cash resources to build capital, pay down other outstanding obligations, or grow
our business. There may be other situations not presently foreseeable in which the ownership of Notes by related persons may create conflicts
of interest. These conflicts of interest could result in action or inaction by management that is adverse to other holders of the Notes. 

We
have three lines of credit from affiliates which allow us to incur a significant amount of secured debt. These lines are collateralized
by a lien against all of our assets. Our purchase and sale agreements function as secured debt as well. We expect to incur a significant
amount of additional debt in the future, including issuance of the Notes, which will subject us to increased risk of loss. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 35,000 of secured debt outstanding on our senior debt lines of credit from affiliates of 2,500,000 and
the capacity to sell portions of many loans under the terms of our loan purchase and sale agreements. The affiliate loans are collateralized
by a lien against all of our assets. The loan purchase and sale agreements and other secured debt are with third-parties and are collateralized
by loans. In addition, we expect to incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including issuance of the Notes, borrowing
under credit facilities and other arrangements. The Notes will be subordinated in right of payment to all secured debt, including the
affiliate loans. Therefore, in the event of a default on the secured debt, affiliates of our Company, including Mr. Wallach, have the
right to receive payment ahead of Note holders, as do other secured debt holders, such as the loan purchasers under the purchase and
sale agreements. Accordingly, our business is subject to increased risk of a total loss of our Note holders investments if we
are unable to repay all of our secured debt. 

Risks
Related to Liquidity 

We
depend on the availability of significant sources of credit to meet our liquidity needs and our failure to maintain these sources of
credit could materially and adversely affect our liquidity in the future. 

We
plan to maintain our loan purchase and sale agreements and our lines of credit from affiliates so that we may draw funds when necessary
to meet our obligation to redeem maturing Notes, pay interest on the Notes, meet our commitments to lend money to our customers, and
for other general corporate purposes. Certain features of the loan purchase and sale agreements with third parties have added liquidity
and flexibility, which have lessened the need for the lines of credit from affiliates. If we fail to maintain liquidity through our loan
purchase and sale agreements and lines of credit for any reason, including a potential negative impact to the credit markets as a result
of an outbreak of a communicable illness such as COVID-19, we will be more dependent on the proceeds from the Notes for our continued
liquidity. If the sale of the Notes is significantly reduced or delayed for any reason and we fail to obtain or renew a line of credit,
or we default on any of our lines of credit, then our ability to meet our obligations, including our Note obligations, could be materially
adversely affected, and we may not have enough cash to pay back Note holders investments. 

21 

In
addition, the borrowing capacity on two of our lines of credit is based on the amount outstanding on the underlying collateral loans.
If we are unable to find suitable investment opportunities, we may not be able to replace the underlying collateral loans with new loans
and, in such a situation, the borrowing capacity on those lines of credit would be reduced. Also, the failure to maintain an active line
of credit (and therefore using cash for liquidity instead of a borrowing line) will reduce our earnings, because we will be paying interest
on the Notes, while we are holding cash instead of reducing our borrowings. 

We
have unfunded commitments to builders as of December 31, 2022. If every builder borrowed every amount allowed (which would mean all of
their homes were complete) and no builders paid us back, we would need to fund that amount. While some of that amount would automatically
come from our loan purchase and sale agreements, the rest would have to come from our Notes Program and/or our lines of credit. Therefore,
we may not have the ability to fund our commitments to builders. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have 19,730,000 of unfunded commitments to builders. If every builder borrowed every amount allowed and no
builders repaid us then we would need to fund that amount. Lines of credit, loan purchase and sale agreements, payoffs from builders,
and immediate investments in our Notes may not be enough to fund our commitments to builders as they become payable. If we default on
these obligations, then we may face any one or more of the following: a higher default rate, lawsuits brought by customers, an eventual
lack of business from borrowers, missed principal and interest payments to Note holders and holders of other debt, and a lack of desire
for investors to invest in our Notes Program. Therefore, we could default on our repayment obligations to our Note holders. 

We
have two secured lines of credit which expire in 2023, and the unsecured portion of a line of credit which also expires in 2023. Failure
of those lines to renew could strain our ability to pay other obligations. 

We
have a 1,325,000 line of credit (the Shuman LOC ). As of December 31, 2022, the amount outstanding under the Shuman LOC
was 125,000 which is due in July 2023. We do not know whether the Shuman LOC will be renewed. We also have a 7,000,000 line of credit
(the Swanson LOC ), a portion of which is unsecured (the Unsecured Swanson LOC ). The balances on the Swanson
LOC that were secured and unsecured as of December 31, 2022 were 6,473,000 and 527,000 respectively. Both the secured and unsecured
portions of the Swanson LOC are due in July 2023. We do not know whether the Swanson LOC will be renewed. If we are unable to renegotiate
or extend these lines of credit, then we may default on one or both of those lines of credit. Therefore, we could default on repayment
obligations to some of our debt holders, including our Note holders. 

We
have a significant amount of debt and expect to incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including issuance of the
Notes, which will subject us to increased risk of loss. Our present and future senior debt may make it difficult to repay the Notes. 

We
have a significant amount of debt and expect to incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2022,
we have approximately 53,283,000 of debt, net of deferred financing costs. Our primary sources of debt include our lines of credit,
loan purchase and sale agreements, and the Notes. As of December 31, 2022, we have a total outstanding balance of 11,200,000 on our
lines of credit and approximately 13,166,000 on our loan purchase and sale agreements. We also have the capacity to sell portions of
many loans under the terms of our loan purchase and sale agreements. The loan purchase and sale agreements and other secured debt are
with third parties and all but one of the lines of credit are collateralized by loans that we have issued to builders. The Notes are
subordinate and junior in priority to any and all of our senior debt and senior subordinated debt, and equal to any and all non-senior
debt, including other Notes. There are no restrictions in the indenture regarding the amount of senior debt or other indebtedness that
we may incur. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,830,000 in Notes coming due by December 2023, and we cannot be certain
whether we will be able to fund those Notes upon maturity. Upon the maturity of our senior debt, by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise,
the holders of our senior debt have first right to receive payment, in full, prior to any payments being made to a Note holder or to
other non-senior debt. Therefore, upon such maturity of our senior debt Note holders would only be repaid in full if the senior debt
is satisfied first and, following satisfaction of the senior debt, if there is an amount sufficient to fully satisfy all amounts owed
under the Notes and any other non-senior debt. 

22 

In
addition, we expect to incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including issuance of the Notes, borrowing under
credit facilities, and other arrangements. The Notes will be subordinated in right of payment to all secured debt, including the Wallach
Affiliate LOCs, Myrick LOC, loan purchase and sale agreements, the senior subordinated note discussed in the prior paragraph, and the
line of credit discussed in the prior paragraph. Therefore, in the event of a default on the secured debt, affiliates of our Company,
including Mr. Wallach, have the right to receive payment ahead of Note holders, as do other secured debt holders, such as the loan purchasers
under the loan purchase and sale agreements. Accordingly, our business is subject to increased risk of a total loss of a Noteholder s
investment if we are unable to repay all of our secured debt. 

If
the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes exceed the cash flow needed to fund the desirable business opportunities that are identified,
we may not be able to invest all of the funds in a manner that generates sufficient income to pay the interest and principal on the Notes. 

Our
ability to pay interest on our debt, including the Notes, pay our expenses, and cover loan losses is dependent upon interest and fee
income we receive from loans extended to our customers. If we are not able to lend to a sufficient number of customers at high enough
interest rates, we may not have enough interest and fee income to meet our obligations, which could impair our ability to pay interest
and principal on the Notes. If money brought in from new Notes and from repayments of loans from our customers exceeds our short-term
obligations such as expenses, Notes interest and redemptions, and line of credit principal and interest, then it is likely to be held
as cash, which will have a lower return than the interest rate we are paying on the Notes. This will lower earnings and may cause losses
which could impair our ability to repay the principal and interest on the Notes. 

Increases
in interest rates would increase the amount of debt payments under the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and Myrick LOC which could impair our ability
to repay the principal and interest on the Notes. 

The
interest rate under the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and Myrick LOC is generally equal to the prime rate plus three percent. Increases in interest
rates will increase the applicable prime rate and therefore, the interest rate under the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and the Myrick LOC will
increase. An increase in the interest rate would increase the amount of debt payments under the Wallach Affiliate LOCs and the Myrick
LOC? which would reduce our cash flows and could impair our ability to repay the principal and interest on the Notes. 

We
incurred indebtedness secured by our office property, which may result in foreclosure. 

The
debt incurred by us in connection with our office property is secured by a mortgage. If we default on our secured indebtedness, the lender
may foreclose and the entire investment in the office property could be lost, which could adversely affect our ability to repay the principal
and interest on the Notes. 

The
indenture does not contain the type of covenants restricting our actions, such as restrictions on creating senior debt, paying distributions
to our owners, merging, recapitalizing, and/or entering into highly leveraged transactions. The indenture does not contain provisions
requiring early payment of Notes in the event we suffer a material adverse change in our business or fail to meet certain financial standards.
Therefore, the indenture provides very little protection of Note holders investments. 

The
Notes do not have the benefit of extensive covenants. The covenants in the indenture are not designed to protect Note holders 
investments if there is a material adverse change in our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For
example, the indenture does not contain any restrictions on our ability to create or incur senior debt or other debt to pay distributions
to our equity holders, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President. It also does not contain any financial
covenants (such as a fixed charge coverage or a minimum amount of equity) to help ensure our ability to pay interest and principal on
the Notes. The indenture does not contain provisions that permit Note holders to require that we redeem the Notes if there is a takeover,
recapitalization or similar restructuring. In addition, the indenture does not contain covenants specifically designed to protect Note
holders if we engage in a highly leveraged transaction. Therefore, the indenture provides very little protection of Note holders 
investments. 

23 

Payment
on the Notes is subordinate to the payment of our outstanding present and future senior debt, if any. Since there is no limit to the
amount of senior debt we may incur, our present and future senior debt may make it difficult to repay the Notes. 

Our
loan purchase and sale agreements and secured lines of credit with third-parties also function as senior debt. The balance on those loan
purchase and sale agreements and other secured debt, net of deferred financing costs was 23,173,000 on December 31, 2022, and is expected
to grow in the future. In addition, we have 1,250,000 in senior unsecured lines of credits which were fully drawn as of December 31,
2022. We also have senior subordinated notes which are senior to the Notes of 1,094,000 as of December 31, 2022. The Notes are subordinate
and junior in priority to any and all of our senior debt and senior subordinated debt, and equal to any and all non-senior debt, including
other Notes. The Notes are senior to junior subordinated notes. There are no restrictions in the indenture regarding the amount of senior
debt or other indebtedness that we may incur. Upon the maturity of our senior debt, by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise, the
holders of our senior debt have first right to receive payment, in full, prior to any payments being made to a Note holder or to other
non-senior debt. Therefore, upon such maturity of our senior debt Note holders would only be repaid in full if the senior debt is satisfied
first and, following satisfaction of the senior debt, if there is an amount sufficient to fully satisfy all amounts owed under the Notes
and any other non-senior debt. 

Additional
competition for investment dollars may decrease our liquidity, which would adversely affect our ability to repay the Notes. 

We
could experience increased competition for investment dollars from other companies and financial institutions that are willing to offer
higher interest rates. We may be forced to increase our interest rates in order to maintain or increase the issuance of Notes. Any increase
in our interest rates could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to meet a debt covenant under any future lines of
credit obtained and/or to repay the Notes. 

If
we are unable to meet our Note maturity and redemption obligations, and we are unable to obtain additional financing or other sources
of capital, we may be forced to sell off our operating assets or we might be forced to cease our operations, and Note holders could lose
some or all of their investment. 

Our
Notes have maturities ranging from one year to four years. In addition, holders of our Notes may request redemption upon death and we
would be obligated to fulfill such redemption request. Holders of a 36-month Note issued on or after February 4, 2020 may request redemption
at any time and, subject to certain limitations, we would be obligated to fulfill such redemption request. We intend to pay our Note
maturity and redemption obligations using our normal cash sources, such as collections on our loans to customers, as well as proceeds
from the Notes Program. We may experience periods in which our Note maturity and redemption obligations are high. Since our loans are
generally repaid when our borrower sells a real estate asset, our operations and other sources of funds may not provide sufficient available
cash flow to meet our continued Note maturity and redemption obligations. While we have secured lines of credit from affiliates of up
to 2,500,000 with 35,000 borrowed as of December 31, 2022, our affiliates are not obligated to fund our borrowing requests. For all
of these reasons we may be substantially reliant upon the net offering proceeds we receive from the Notes Program to pay these obligations.
If we are unable to repay or redeem the principal amount of the Notes when due, and we are unable to obtain additional financing or other
sources of capital, we may be forced to sell off our operating assets or we might be forced to cease our operations, and Note holders
could lose some or all of their investment. 

There
is no early warning on the Notes if we perform poorly. Only interest and principal payment defaults on the Notes can trigger
a default on the Notes prior to a bankruptcy. 

There
are a limited number of performance covenants to be maintained under the Notes and/or the indenture. Therefore, no early warning 
of a possible default by us exists. Under the indenture, only (i) the non-payment of interest and/or principal on the Notes by us when
payments are due, (ii) our bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iii) a failure to comply with provisions of the Notes or the indenture (if such
failure is not cured or waived within 60 days after receipt of a specific notice) could cause a default to occur. 

24 

Note
holders do not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before they are made. 

We
intend to use the net offering proceeds in accordance with the Use of Proceeds section of our prospectus, including investment
in secured real estate loans for the acquisition and development of parcels of real property as single-family residential lots and/or
the construction of single-family homes. Since we have not identified any investments that we will make with the net proceeds of this
offering, we are generally unable to provide Note holders with information to evaluate the potential investments we may make with the
net offering proceeds before purchasing the Notes. Note holders must rely on our management to evaluate our investment opportunities,
and we are subject to the risk that our management may not be able to achieve our objectives, may make unwise decisions, or may make
decisions that are not in our best interest. 

A
portion of our collateral securing the Pennsylvania Loans is preferred equity in our Company. In the event of a foreclosure on the properties
securing the Pennsylvania Loans, a portion of our collateral is preferred equity in our Company, it would be difficult to sell the preferred
equity in order to reduce the loan balance. 

Some
of the collateral securing the Pennsylvania Loans is preferred equity in our Company, which has a book value of 1,900,000 as of December
31, 2022. If the borrower defaults on any of the Pennsylvania Loans and we are forced to use collateral to repay any of the Pennsylvania
Loans, we will need to sell this preferred interest in us to a third party. There is no liquid market for this instrument, so we can
give no assurance as to our ability to generate any amount of proceeds from that collateral. 

Because
we require a substantial amount of cash to service our debt, we may not be able to pay our obligations under the Notes. 

To
service our total indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including
our successful financial and operating performance. We cannot assure Note holders that our business plans will succeed or that we will
achieve our anticipated financial results, which may prevent us from being able to pay our obligations under the Notes. 

The
indenture and terms of our Notes do not restrict our use of leverage. A relatively small loss can cause over leveraged companies to suffer
a material adverse change in their financial position. If this happened to us, it may make it difficult to repay the Notes. 

Financial
institutions which are federally insured typically have 8-12 of their total assets in equity. A reduction in their loan assets due to
losses of 2 reduces their equity by roughly 20 . We had 14 of our loan assets in equity as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. If we allow
our assets to increase without increasing our equity, we could have a much lower equity as a percentage of assets than we have today,
which would increase our risk of non-payment on the Notes. Note holders have no structural mechanism to protect them from this action,
and rely solely on us to keep equity at a satisfactory ratio. 

We
expect to be substantially reliant upon the net offering proceeds we receive from the sale of our Notes to meet principal and interest
obligations on previously issued Notes. 

We
intend to use the net offering proceeds from the sale of Notes to, among other things, make payments on other borrowings, fund redemption
obligations, make interest payments on the Notes, and to run our business to the extent that other sources of liquidity from our operations
(e.g., repayment of loans we have previously extended to our customers) and our credit lines are inadequate. However, these other sources
of liquidity are subject to risks. Our operations alone may not produce a sufficient return on investment to repay interest and principal
on our outstanding Notes. We may not be able to obtain an additional line of credit when needed or retain one or more of our existing
lines of credit. We may not be able to attract new investors, have sufficient loan repayments, or have sufficient borrowing capacity
when we need additional funds to repay principal and interest on our outstanding Notes or redeem our outstanding Notes. If any of these
things occur, our liquidity and capital needs may be severely affected, and we may be forced to sell off our loan receivables and other
operating assets, or we may be forced to cease our operations. 

If
we default in our Note payment obligations, the indenture agreements provide that the trustee could accelerate all payments due under
the Notes, which would further negatively affect our consolidated financial position and cash flows. 

Our
obligations with respect to the Notes are governed by the terms of indenture agreements with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association
as trustee. Under the indentures, in addition to other possible events of default, if we fail to make a payment of principal or interest
under any Note and this failure is not cured within 30 days, then we will be deemed in default. Upon such a default, the trustee or holders
of 25 in principal of the outstanding Notes could declare all principal and accrued interest immediately due and payable. If our total
assets do not cover these payment obligations, then we would most likely be unable to make all payments under the Notes when due, and
we might be forced to cease our operations. 

25 

There
is no sinking fund to ensure repayment of the Notes at maturity, so Note holders are totally reliant upon our ability to generate adequate
cash flows. 

We
do not contribute funds to a separate account, commonly known as a sinking fund, to repay the Notes upon maturity. Because funds are
not set aside periodically for the repayment of the Notes over their respective terms, Note holders must rely on our consolidated cash
flows from operations, investing and financing activities and other sources of financing for repayment, such as funds from sale of the
Notes, loan repayments, and other borrowings. To the extent cash flows from operations and other sources are not sufficient to repay
the Notes, the Note holders may lose all or part of their investment. 

If
we have a large number of repayments on the Notes, whether because of maturity or redemption, we may be unable to make such repayments. 

We
are obligated to redeem a Note without any interest penalty (i) upon the death of an investor, if requested by the executor or administrator
of the investor s estate (or if the Note is held jointly, by the surviving joint investor), and (ii) subject to certain limitations,
upon request by an investor holding a 36-month Note issued on or after February 4, 2020. Such redemption requests are not subject to
our consent but are subject to restrictions in the indenture. We may be faced with a large number of such redemption requests at one
time. We are also required to repay all of the Notes upon their maturity. If the amounts of those repayments are too high, and we cannot
offset them with loan repayments, secure new financing, or issue additional Notes, we may not have the liquidity to repay the investments.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

(All
dollar [ ] amounts shown in thousands.) 

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. See also Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I. 

Overview 

We
were organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the name 84 RE Partners, LLC and changed our name to Shepherd s
Finance, LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. Our business is focused on
commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market is underserved because
of the lack of traditional lenders currently participating in the market. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Our operations are
governed pursuant to our limited liability company agreement. 

The
commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium
sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In some circumstances, the lot is purchased with
an older home on the lot which is then either removed or rehabilitated. If the home is rehabilitated, the loan is referred to as a rehab 
loan. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of lots and undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential
building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position and the opportunities available to us, do none, any or all of the
following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate
or other collateral), purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we
will operate our business. 

Economic
and Industry Dynamics 

During
2022, the Company continued to focus on the reduction of non-interest earning assets. As of December 31, 2022, loans classified as non-accrual
were 14 or 7,177 compared to 23 or 9,526 as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had 3 foreclosed
assets or 1,582 and 5 or 2,724, respectively. 

28 

The
Company continues to lose interest income on assets that do not accrue interest. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the estimated
loss on interest income related to impaired and foreclosed assets was 1,226. Looking ahead, we expect this to decrease as we continue
to focus on the reduction through selling our remaining non-interest earning assets in 2023. 

While
the Company continues to face risks as it relates to the economy and the homebuilding industry, management has decided to focus on the
following during 2023: 

1. 
 Continue
 to decrease the balance of non-interest-bearing assets, which includes foreclosed real estate and classified non-accrual
 assets. 

2. 
 While
 we anticipate lower loan originations in 2023 as compared to 2022, we will increase our focus on fix and flips as a percentage of
 sales. 

3. 
 Lower
 SG A expenses. 

4. 
 Maintain
 a consistent margin, similar to our current spread. 

5. 
 Maintain
 liquidity at a level sufficient for loan originations. 

During
2023, the housing market in most of the areas in which we do business will likely decline as compared to the same period of time in 2022
due to the impact of current economic conditions. While markets will probably weaken compared to where they were during 2022, we anticipate
losses incurred in principal related to COVID-19 will decrease, and the lower interest income due to nonperforming assets will continue
to decrease during 2023 as compared to 2022. Short term interest rates are expected to continue to rise. Mortgage rates peaked mid-2022
and have declined since. A continued rise in short term rates is likely to benefit the company as our competitors rates will rise
faster than ours making us more competitive, but an additional rise in long term interest rates would negatively impact the housing industry
as a whole, and therefore us. 

Perceived
Challenges and Anticipated Responses 

The
following is not intended to represent a comprehensive list or description of the risks or challenges facing the Company. Currently,
our management is most focused on the following challenges along with the corresponding actions to address those challenges: 

Perceived
 Challenges and Risks 

Anticipated
 Management Actions/Response 
 
 Potential
 loan value-to-collateral value issues (i.e., being underwater on particular loans) 

We
 manage this challenge by risk-rating both the geographic region and the builder, and then adjusting the loan-to-value (i.e., the
 loan amount versus the value of the collateral) based on risk assessments. Additionally, we collect a deposit up-front for construction
 loans. Despite these efforts, if values in a particular area of the country drop by 60 , we will have loaned more than the value
 of the collateral. We have found that the best solution to this risk is a speedy resolution of the loan, and helping the builder
 finish the home rapidly rather than foreclosing on the partially built home. Our experience in this area will help us limit, but
 not eliminate, the negative effects in the event of another economic downturn. 
 
 Concentration
 of loan portfolio (i.e., how many of the loans are of or with any particular type, customer, or geography) 

As
 of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 27 and 26 , respectively, of our outstanding loan commitments consist of loans to one borrower, and
 the collateral is in one real estate market, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a significant
 portion of these loans is susceptible to changes in market conditions in that area. As of December 31, 2022, our next two largest
 customers make up 9 and 7 of our loan commitments, with loans in Cape Coral and Orlando, Florida, respectively. As of December
 31, 2021, our next two largest customers made up 7 and 4 of our loan commitments, with loans in Orlando, Florida and Spokane, Washington,
 respectively. In the upcoming years, we plan on continuing to increase our geographic and builder diversity while continuing to focus
 on our residential homebuilder customers. 

29 

Not
 having funds available to us to service the commitments we have 

As
 of December 31, 2022, our typical construction loan had about 69 of its loan amount outstanding
 on average. That means that on average, about 31 of the commitment is not loaned, usually
 because the house is not complete. As of December 31, 2022, unfunded commitments were 19,730,
 which we will fund along with our purchase and sale agreement participants. However, if we
 are short on cash, we could do the following: 

raise interest rates on the Notes we offer to our investors to attract new Note investments; 

sell more secured interests on our loans; or 

draw down on our lines of credit from our affiliates. 
 
 Non-payment
 of interest by our customers 

Most
 of our customers pay interest on a monthly basis, and these funds are used to, among other things, pay interest on our debt monthly.
 While we have the liquidity to withstand some non-payment of interest, if a high percentage of our customers were not paying interest,
 it will impede our ability to pay our debts on time. 
 
 Nonperforming
 assets 

As
 of December 31, 2022, nonperforming assets were approximately 6,526 (defined as impaired loans, net and/or loans on nonaccrual plus
 foreclosed assets net of reserves). 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

To
assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use. We consider
an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly
uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period
to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations. 

Loan
Losses 

Future
losses on current loans are estimated in our financial statements. This estimate is important because it is on our largest asset (loans
receivable). It is impossible to know what these losses will be, as the condition of the market cannot be determined, and specific situations
with each loan are unpredictable and change constantly. Loan losses, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance
sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the number of
losses to capture during the current year. This current period amount incurred is referred to as the loan loss provision. The calculation
of our allowance for loan losses, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to Loans receivable, net and is detailed
in the notes to our financial statements, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate
the number of probable losses inherent in our commercial lending operations and to reflect that estimated risk in our allowance calculations.
We use the policy summarized as follows: 

We
establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of each quarter. This collective reserve
includes both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. In addition to historical loss information, the analysis incorporates collateral
value, decisions made by management and staff, percentage of aging spec loans, policies, procedures, and economic conditions. 

We
individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past are due at the end of each quarter. We also review for
impairment all loans to one borrower with greater than or equal to 10 of our total committed balances. If required, the analysis includes
a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan. 

For
impaired loans, if the value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included
in the allowance for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and
some loans may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and
completed basis and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property. 

30 

For
loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last 13
months if construction is greater than 90 complete. If construction is less than 90 complete the Company uses the latest appraisal
on file. At certain times the Company may choose to use a broker s opinions of value BOV as a replacement for an
appraisal if deemed more efficient by management. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal.
Broker s opinion of selling price, use currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual
closings by the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker s opinion of value. 

Appraisers
are state certified, and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report. If that
appraiser is unavailable or unreasonably expensive, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area. BOVs are
created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select another agent
who works in that geographic area. 

Currently,
fair value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision. Specifically, relevant to the allowance
for loan loss reserve is the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances. Fair value measurements
are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. Due to a rapidly changing economic market, an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be
used to develop fair value estimates, and the various assumptions that could be used, determining the collateral s fair value requires
significant judgment. 

December 31, 2022 Loan Loss Provision 
 
 Change in Fair Value Assumption 
 Higher/(Lower) 
 
 Increasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35 

Decreasing fair value of the real estate collateral by 35 
 3,478 

Increases in the fair value of the real estate collateral do not impact the loan loss provision, as the value generally is not written
up. 

If the loans were nonperforming, assuming a book amount of the loans outstanding of 56,650, and the fair value of the real estate collateral
on all outstanding loans was reduced by 35 . 

Foreclosed
Assets 

Foreclosed
assets, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations. On the
consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the amount of impairment to capture when a loan is converted to a foreclosed
asset, the impairment when the value of an asset drops below the carrying amount, and any loss or gain upon final disposition of the
asset. The calculation of the impairment, which appears on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the asset, requires us to
compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and estimate the value of the asset and therefore any required impairment
thereof. We use the policy summarized as follows: 

For
properties which exist in the condition in which we intend to sell them, we obtain an appraisal of the assets current value. We reduce
the appraised value by 10 to account for estimated selling costs. This amount is used to initially book the asset. Typically, prior
to the initial booking of the foreclosed asset, the loan has already been reserved to this level. If during ownership, the value of the
foreclosed asset drops, an additional impairment is recorded. For assets that need to be improved prior to sale, we adjust the portion
of the appraised value related to construction improvements for the percentage of the improvements which have not yet been made. 

31 

The
fair value of real estate will impact our foreclosed asset value, which is recorded at 100 of fair value (after selling costs are deducted).
Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants. 

December 31, 
 2022 Foreclosed Assets 
 
 Change in Fair Value Assumption 
 Higher/(Lower) 
 
 Increasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35 

Decreasing fair value of the foreclosed asset by 35 
 554 

Increases in the fair value of the foreclosed assets do not impact the carrying value, as the value generally is not written up. 
Those gains would be recognized at the sale of the asset. However, the increase in fair value may be recognized up to the cost basis
of the foreclosed asset which was determined at the foreclosure date. 

Other
Loss Contingencies 

Other
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably
estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision. Contingent
liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often
depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as courts, arbitrators, juries, or regulators. 

Accounting
and Auditing Standards Applicable to Emerging Growth Companies 

We
are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we are
not required to: (1) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (2) provide an auditor s attestation report
on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory
audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information
about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer or (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5,
2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. However, we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period discussed
in (4), and will therefore comply with new or revised accounting standards on the applicable dates on which the adoption of such standards
is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of such extended transition
period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

Other
Significant Accounting Policies 

Other
significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless
important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Policies related to credit quality information, fair value measurements,
offsetting assets and liabilities, related party transactions and revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters
that are often subject to multiple and recent changes in the authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently
under re-examination or have recently been addressed by accounting standard setters and regulators. Specific conclusions have not been
reached by these standard setters, and outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also, see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements,
as they discuss accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. 

Consolidated
Results of Operations 

Key
financial and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are set forth below. For a more complete understanding of
our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements, including the related notes and the other information contained in this document. 

Accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require that we report financial and descriptive information
about reportable segments and how these segments were determined. Our management determines the allocation and performance of resources
based on operating income, net income and operating cash flows. Segments are identified and aggregated based on the products sold or
services provided and the market(s) they serve. Based on these factors, management has determined that our ongoing operations are in
one segment, commercial lending.

Net
income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 995 to 1,760 when compared to the same period of 2021. The increase in net income
was primarily due to an increase in loan assets and decreasing the economic effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, most importantly
nonperforming assets and loan losses. 

We
had 56,650 and 46,943 in loan assets, net as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had 230 construction
loans in 21 states with 66 borrowers and 20 development loans in nine states with 14 borrowers.

There
are three main components that can impact our interest spread: 

Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings). The
loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum cost of funds of 7 . For most loans,
the margin is fixed at 2.5 ; however, for our development loans the margin is generally fixed at 7 . This component is also impacted
by the lending of money with no interest cost (our equity). 

Interest
income on loans was 13 and 11 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Estimated interest not earned during the
year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to loans impaired as a result of COVID-19 was 467 and 926, respectively. 

We
anticipate our standard margin to be 2.5 on all future construction loans and generally 7 on all development loans which yields a blended
margin of approximately 3.5 . This 3.0 may increase because some customers run past the standard repayment time and pay a higher rate
of interest after that. In 2022, the margin not including fee income was 4 vs. 1 in 2021. 

Fee income. Our construction loan fee is 5 on the amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life
of each loan. When loans terminate before their expected life, the remaining fee is recognized at the termination of the loan. In 2022,
we started charging an annual fee on most of our development loans which varies. 

Fee
income on loans before deferred loan fee adjustments decreased 1 to 6 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 7 for the same
period of 2021. The decrease primarily related to modification fees charged on certain loans during 2021. 

Deferred
loan origination fees decreased to 1 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2 for the same period of 2021. The decrease in
deferred loan origination fees was primarily due to the number of closed construction and development loans, which were 192 and 227,
respectively. 

Amount of nonperforming assets. Generally, we can have two types of nonperforming assets that negatively affect interest
spread: loans not paying interest and foreclosed assets. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 14 impaired loans in the aggregate amount of 7,177 and 23 impaired loans in the aggregate amount
of 9,526 that were not paying interest, respectively. Non-performing assets not related to the impact of COVID-19 were 3,842 of the
 7,177 for 2022 and 2,914 of the 9,526 for 2021. 

34 

Foreclosed
assets do not provide a monthly interest return. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, foreclosed assets were 1,582 and 2,724, respectively,
which resulted in a negative impact on our interest spread in both years. 

The
amount of nonperforming assets is expected to decrease as we continue to sell our non-interest earning assets during the first half of
2023 compared to the same period in 2022. 

Loan
Loss Provision 

Loan
loss provision (expense throughout the year) was 930 and 588 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Due to the
changes in economic conditions during 2022, we revised the calculation of our loan loss provision which resulted in an increase in reserve
across all loan types. As a result, while the percentage of nonperforming loans went down, the reserve increased. 

The
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 was 2,527 which primarily consisted of 294 for loans without specific reserves, 246
for loans with specific reserves and 1,987 for specific reserves due to the impact of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we incurred 451 in direct charge offs. 

The
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was 2,048 which primarily consisted of 163 for loans without specific reserves, 342
for loans with specific reserves, 60 for special mention loans and 1,483 for specific reserves due to the impact of COVID-19. During
the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred 509 in direct charge offs. 

Non-Interest
Income 

Gain
on Sale of Foreclosed Assets 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 101 and 166, respectively, as a gain on the sale of foreclosed assets which
related to the sale of two and six foreclosed assets during 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Dividend
Income 

During
January 2021, we invested 500 in Series A Preferred Units in Benjamin Marcus Homes, LLC. During the year ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, 62 and 0 of dividend income was recognized related to the Series A Preferred Units investment, respectively. See
Note 14, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements. 

Other
Income 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, we consulted for two of our construction and development loan customers which included accounting guidance
and recognized 154 in other income. No consulting services were performed during the year ended December 31, 2021. We anticipate to
continue our consulting services to our customers on an as needed basis during 2023. 

Gain
on Foreclosure of Assets 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 0 and 67, respectively, as a gain on the foreclosure of assets. We transferred
one loan receivable asset to foreclosed assets for both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The transfer for the year ended December
31, 2021 resulted in a gain. 

Gain
on the Extinguishment of Debt 

During
April 2020, the Company received a grant under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance (the EIDL Advance of
 10 which was used for payroll and other certain operating expenses. In February 2021, the full EIDL Advance of 10 and accrued interest
were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 

35 

During
February 2021, the Company received their second draw of the Paycheck Protection Program PPP loan created under the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act for 316 which was used to cover payroll and certain other identified costs. During August 2021,
the full amount of the PPP loan was forgiven.

2022 compared to 819 for the same period of 2021, due primarily to: 

Profit
share expense was 373 and 88 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; 

Employee
 retention credits and tax refunds were 0 and 328 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; and 

Deferred
 loan origination salaries expenses were 664 and 765 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Impairment
Loss on Foreclosed Assets 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 2 and 10 as a loss on impairment of foreclosed assets, respectively. 

Loss
on the Sale of Foreclosed Assets 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 0 and 92 as loss on the sale of one and seven foreclosed assets, respectively. 

Loss
on Foreclosure of Assets 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 0 and 47 as a loss on foreclosure of assets. We transferred one loan receivable
asset to foreclosed assets during both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Consolidated
Financial Position 

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

We
try to avoid borrowing on our lines of credit from affiliates. To accomplish this, we must carry some cash for liquidity. This amount
generally grows as our Company grows. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash was 2,996 and 3,755, respectively, and our restricted
cash was 1,200 and 0, respectively. 

36 

During
2022, we received two deposits for one of our sold real estate assets which was deemed restricted until construction is completed on
the home was complete. See our Liquidity and Capital Resources section for more information.

Real
Estate Investments 

During
June 2020, we acquired four lots from a borrower in exchange for the transfer of loans secured by those lots. We extinguished the principal
balance for the loans on the lots in the amount of 640 and in addition, paid a 500 management fee for the development of homes on the
lots. The management fee was paid through reducing the principal balance on a current loan receivable with the borrower. Two of the four
homes sold during 2022 and the others have sales contracts which will finalize once the construction on the homes are complete.

Customer
Interest Escrow 

The
Pennsylvania Loans call for a funded interest escrow account which was initially funded with proceeds from the Pennsylvania Loans. The
initial funding on that interest escrow was 450. The balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 646 and 203, respectively. To the
extent the balance is available in the interest escrow, interest due on certain loans is deducted from the interest escrow on the date
due. The interest escrow is increased by 20 of lot payoffs on the same loans, and by interest and/or distributions on a loan in which
we are the borrower and Investor s Mark Acquisitions, LLC is the lender and on the Series B preferred equity. All of these transactions
are noncash to the extent that the total escrow amount does not need additional funding. 

We
had 18 and 47 other loans active as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which also had interest escrows. The cumulative balance
of all interest escrows other than the Pennsylvania Loans was 120 and 276 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Secured
Borrowings 

Loan
Purchase and Sale Agreements 

We
have two loan purchase and sale agreements where we are the seller of portions of loans we create. The two purchasers are Builder Finance,
Inc. Builder Finance and S.K. Funding, LLC S.K. Funding ). Generally, the purchasers buy between 50 and
75 of each loan sold. They receive interest rates ranging from our cost of funds to the interest rate charged to the borrower (interest
rates were between 6 and 11 for both 2022 and 2021). The purchasers generally do not receive any of the loan fees we charge. We have
the right to call some of the loans sold, with some restrictions. Once sold, the purchaser must fund their portion of the loans purchased.
We service the loans. Also, there are limited put options in some cases, whereby the purchaser can cause us to repurchase a loan. The
loan purchase and sale agreements are recorded as secured borrowings. 

In
March 2018, we entered into the Seventh Amendment (the Seventh Amendment to our Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement with
S.K. Funding. The purpose of the Seventh Amendment was to allow S.K. Funding to purchase a portion of the Pennsylvania Loans. 

43 

The
timing of the Company s principal and interest payments to S.K. Funding under the Seventh Amendment, and S.K. Funding s obligation
to fund the Pennsylvania Loans, vary depending on the total principal amount of the Pennsylvania Loans outstanding at any time, as follows: 

If
 the total principal amount exceeds 1,000, S.K. Funding must fund the amount between 1,000 and less than or equal to 4,500. 

If
 the total principal amount is less than 4,500, then the Company will also repay S.K. Funding s principal as principal payments
 are received on the Pennsylvania Loans from the underlying borrowers in the amount by which the total principal amount is less than
 4,500 until S.K. Funding s principal has been repaid in full. 

The
 interest rate accruing to S.K. Funding under the Seventh Amendment is 10.5 calculated on a 365/366-day basis. 

The
Seventh Amendment had a term of 24 months and automatically renews for additional six-month terms unless either party gives written notice
of its intent not to renew at least six months prior to the end of a term. S.K. Funding will have a priority position as compared to
the Company in the case of a default by any of the borrowers. 

In
April 2021, we entered into the Eleventh Amendment (the Eleventh Amendment to our Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement with
S.K. Funding. The purpose of the Eleventh Amendment was to allow a principal increase to 2,000 from the original 1,000 in the Tenth
Amendment dated January 2019. In addition, if the collateral value drops then an unsecured portion or 400 may be used until the collateral
is increased back to 2,000. 

The
Eleventh Amendment has a term of 12 months and automatically renews for additional six-month terms unless either party gives written
notice of its intent not to renew at least five months prior to the end of a term. S.K. Funding will have a priority position as compared
to the Company in the case of a default by any of the borrowers.

The
effective interest rate on borrowings through our Notes Program at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was 8.60 and 9.28 , respectively,
not including the amortization of deferred financing costs. 

We
generally offer four durations at any given time, ranging from 12 to 48 months from the date of issuance. Our fourth public notes offering,
which was declared effective on September 16, 2022, includes a mandatory early redemption option on all Notes, provided that the proceeds
are reinvested. In our historical offerings, there were limited rights of early redemption. Our 36-month Note sold in our third public
notes offering had a mandatory early redemption option, subject to certain conditions.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
primary liquidity management objective is to meet expected cash flow needs while continuing to service our business and customers. As
of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had combined loans outstanding of 250 and 239, respectively. Gross loans outstanding were 60,974
and 50,763 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Our
net cash provided by operating activities increased 3,142 to 4,691 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 1,549 for the same period of
2021. The increase was primarily due to the following: 

Higher
 net income which was 1,760 for the period ended December 31, 2022 compared to 765 for the same period of 2021; 

Higher
 provision for loan losses which was 930 for the period ended December 31,2022 compared to 588 for the same period of 2021; 

Gain
 on extinguishment of debt was 0 for the period ended December 31, 2022 compared to 371 for the same period of 2021; 

Higher
 other assets which were 197 as of December 31, 2022 compared to (133) compared to the same period of 2021; and 

Higher
 accrued interest payable which was 1,114 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 716 compared to the same period of 2021. 

Unfunded
commitments to extend credit, which have similar collateral, credit and market risk to our outstanding loans, were 19,730 and 22,902
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, other than unfunded commitments, we had no off-balance sheet
transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements or obligations. 

We
anticipate lower originations and payoffs during the 12 months ending December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 21, 2022
due primarily to the current economic decline in housing market activity. 

To
fund our combined loans, we rely on secured debt, unsecured debt, and equity, which are described in the following table:

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was 4,196 and 3,735, respectively. Secured debt, net of deferred
financing costs increased 3,157 to 23,173 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 20,016 for the same period of 2021. The increase in
secured debt was due primarily to borrowings pursuant to our loan purchase and sale agreements. However, we anticipate secured debt to
decrease as our loan receivable balances decrease. 

Unsecured
debt, net of deferred financing costs increased 2,397 to 30,110 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 27,713 for the same period of
2021. The increase in unsecured debt primarily related to unsecured notes sold outside of our Notes Program. 

49 

We
borrowed approximately 361 during February 2021, pursuant to the PPP, which was to cover payroll and other identified costs. During
August 2021, the full principal amount of the PPP loans and the accrued interest were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 

During
April 2020, the Company received an EIDL Advance of 10 which was used for payroll and other certain operating expenses. In February
2021, the full EIDL Advance of 10 and accrued interest were forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 

Equity
increased 1,201 to 7,805 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 6,604 for the same period of 2021. The increase was due primarily to
Series C cumulative preferred equity and Class A common equity. As of December 31, 2022, Series C cumulative preferred equity increased
 711 to 5,725 compared to 5,014 for the same period of 2021. The increase in Class A common equity was 310 to 180 compared to (130)
for the same period of 2021. 

We
anticipate an increase in our common equity and an offsetting decrease in our preferred equity during the 12 months subsequent to December
31, 2022. If we are not able to maintain our equity, we will rely more heavily on raising additional funds through the Notes Program. 

The
total amount of our debt maturing through year ending December 31, 2023 is 30,977, which consists of secured borrowings of 22,607 and
unsecured borrowings of 8,370. 

Secured
borrowings maturing through the year ending December 31, 2022 significantly consists of loan purchase and sale agreements with two loan
purchasers (Builder Finance and S. K. Funding) and six lenders. These secured borrowings are listed as maturing over the next 12 months
due primarily to their related demand loan collateral. The following are secured facilities listed as maturing in 2023 with actual maturity
and renewal dates: 

Swanson
 6,473 due July 2023 and automatically renews unless notice given; 

Shuman
 125 due July 2023 and automatically renews unless notice is given; 

S.
 K. Funding 4,500 due July 2023 and automatically renews unless notice is given; 

S.
 K. Funding 2,600 of the total due January 2024; 

Builder
 Finance, Inc 6,066 with no expiration date; 

New
 LOC Agreements - 2,790 generally one-month notice and six months to reduce principal balance to zero; 

Myrick
 LOC - 35 and due upon demand; and 

Mortgage
 Payable 18, with payments due monthly. 

Unsecured
borrowings due by December 31, 2023 consist of Notes issued pursuant to the Notes Program and other unsecured debt of 5,830 and 2,540,
respectively. To the extent that Notes issued pursuant to the Notes Program are not reinvested upon maturity, we will be required to
fund the maturities, which we anticipate funding through the issuance of new Notes in our Notes Program. Historically, approximately
73 of our Note holders reinvest upon maturity. The 36 month Note in our Notes program has a mandatory early redemption option, subject
to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2023, the 36-month Notes were 3,139. Our other unsecured debt has historically renewed. For
more information on other unsecured borrowings, see Note 7 Borrowings. If other unsecured borrowings are not renewed in the future,
we anticipate funding such maturities through investments in our Notes Program. 

Summary 

We
have the funding available to address the loans we have today, including our unfunded commitments. We anticipate our assets reduce in
2023, however we are prepared for an increase of our assets through the net sources and uses (12-month liquidity) listed above as well
as future capital from debt, redeemable preferred equity, and regular equity. Our expectation to reduce loan asset balances is subject
to changes due demand, the housing market, competition, and COVID-19. Although our secured debt is almost entirely listed as currently
due because of the underlying collateral being demand notes, the vast majority of our secured debt is either contractually set to automatically
renew unless notice is given or, in the case of purchase and sale agreements, has no end date as to when the purchasers will not purchase
new loans (although they are never required to purchase additional loans).

Inflation,
Interest Rates, and Housing Starts 

Since
we are in the housing industry, we are affected by factors that impact that industry. Housing starts impact our customers ability
to sell their homes. Faster sales generally mean higher effective interest rates for us, as the recognition of fees we charge is spread
over a shorter period. Slower sales generally mean lower effective interest rates for us. Slower sales also are likely to increase the
default rate we experience. 

Housing
inflation has a positive impact on our operations. When we lend initially, we are lending a percentage of a home s expected value,
based on historical sales. If those estimates prove to be low (in an inflationary market), the percentage we loaned of the value actually
decreases, reducing potential losses on defaulted loans. The opposite is true in a deflationary housing price market. It is our opinion
that values are well above average in many of the housing markets in the U.S. today, and our lending against these values is resulting
in more risk than prior years. In some of our markets, prices of sold homes are dropping. This is both because some homes are selling
for less and because the average home selling is smaller (more affordable). We anticipate declines in home values in many markets over
the next 12 months. 

Interest
rates have several impacts on our business. First, rates affect housing (starts, home size, etc.). High long-term interest rates may
decrease housing starts, having the effects listed above. We can see this impact now as housing starts recently dropped by approximately
31 . Higher interest rates will also affect our investors. We believe that there will be a spread between the rate our Notes yield to
our investors and the rates the same investors could get on deposits at FDIC insured institutions. We also believe that the spread may
need to widen if these rates rise. For instance, if we pay 7 above average CD rates when CDs are paying 0.5 , when CDs are paying 3 ,
we may have to have a larger than 7 difference. This may cause our lending rates, which are based on our cost of funds, to be uncompetitive.
While the prime rate and fed funds rate have increased significantly in 2022, the CD rates, while increasing, have not increased as much.
High interest rates may also increase builder defaults, as interest payments may become a higher portion of operating costs for the builder.
Below is a chart showing three-year U.S. treasury rates and 30-year fixed mortgage rates. The U.S. treasury rates are used by us here
to approximate CD rates, however in the current environment, this is less accurate than in most years. Short-term interest rates have
risen significantly and long-term interest rates have risen and then fallen somewhat but are generally low historically. 

Housing
prices are also generally correlated with housing starts, so that increases in housing starts usually coincide with increases in housing
values, and the reverse is generally true. Below is a graph showing single family housing starts from 2000 through today.

Code
of Ethics 

Our
board of managers adopted an amended Code of Ethics and Business Conduct on August 6, 2020 (the Code of Ethics ), which
contains general guidelines applicable to our employees, executive officers and the members of our board of managers with the purpose
of promoting the following: (1) honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest
between personal and professional relationships; (2) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that we file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by us; (3) compliance with applicable laws and governmental
rules and regulations; (4) the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified
in the Code of Ethics; and (5) accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics. A copy of the Code of Ethics is posted on our website
at www.shepherdsfinance.com. 

Audit
Committee 

Our
board of managers has established a separately-designated audit committee, whose charter was adopted on August 9, 2012 and last amended
on August 6, 2020. The purpose of the audit committee is to oversee the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes
and the audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements. Our audit committee consists of Messrs. Rauscher, Summers, and
Sheldon, our three independent managers. We have no audit committee financial expert (as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii)
of Regulation S-K). We believe the cost to retain a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. However, our board of managers believes
that each member of the audit committee has sufficient knowledge and relevant background experience to serve on the audit committee. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Executive
Officer Compensation 

This
discussion describes our compensation philosophy and policies for our executive officers, which currently includes our CEO, EVP, EVP
of Operations, EVP of Sales and CFO. 

Objectives
of Executive Officer Compensation Program 

The
objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented executives and to align each executive s
incentives with our short-term and long-term objectives, while maintaining a healthy and stable financial position. Specifically, our
executive compensation program is designed to accomplish the following goals and objectives: 

maintain
 a compensation program that is equitable in our marketplace; 

provide
 opportunities that integrate pay with the short-term and long-term performance goals; 

encourage
 and reward achievement of strategic objectives, while properly balancing a controlled risk-taking behavior; and 

maintain
 an appropriate balance between base salary and short-term and long-term incentive opportunity. 

55 

Determining
Executive Officer Compensation 

The
compensation committee of our board of managers is responsible for determining all aspects of our executive compensation program. The
determination and assessment of executive compensation are primarily driven by the following three factors: (1) market data based on
the compensation levels, programs and practices of other comparable companies for comparable positions, (2) our financial performance,
and (3) executive officer performance. We believe these three factors provide a reasonably measurable assessment of executive performance
in light of building value and creating a healthy financial position for us. We rely upon the judgment of the members of the compensation
committee and not on rigid formulas or short-term changes in business performance in determining the amount and mix of compensation elements
and whether each element provides the appropriate incentive and reward for performance that sustains and enhances our long-term growth. 

Executive
Officer Compensation Components 

Base
Salary 

We
provide each of our paid executive officers with a base salary to compensate such officer for services rendered throughout the year.
Salaries are established annually based on the individual s position, experience, performance, past and potential contribution
to us, and level of responsibility, as well as our overall financial performance. No specific weighting is applied to any one factor
considered, and the independent managers use their judgment and expertise in determining appropriate salaries within the parameters of
the compensation philosophy. 

Bonus 

We
pay each of our executive officers a team bonus mostly based on our overall profitability, which rewarded each of them 500 and 1,300
in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, we rewarded an annual bonus of 1,800 for both 2022 and 2021, which is extended to compensate
vacation expenses. Finally, each executive officer is eligible for a portion of net income earned, or profit share. 

We
pay our EVP of Sales a monthly bonus based on a percentage of all new sales and construction loan payoffs. 

Membership
Interests 

As
the beneficial owner of 80.7 (as of March 1, 2023) of our outstanding common membership interests, Mr. Wallach s interests are
closely aligned with our success. Our Executive Vice President of Operations owns 2 of our outstanding common membership interests and
our Executive Vice President owns 15.3 of our outstanding common membership interests. As we hire additional executive officers, we
may use membership interests in some fashion as part of their compensation.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Transactions
with Affiliates 

Lines
of Credit 

On
December 30, 2011, we obtained two demand loans from Mr. and Mrs. Wallach to finance our operations. These demand loans are collateralized
by a lien against all of our assets and are senior in right of payment to the Notes. Mr. Wallach, our CEO (who is also on our board of
managers), is the beneficial owner of 80.7 of our outstanding common membership interests. 

58 

The
first loan, in the original principal amount of 1,250,000, is payable to Daniel M. Wallach and Joyce S. Wallach, as tenants by the entirety
(the Wallach LOC ). The second loan, in the original principal amount of 250,000, is payable to the 2007 Daniel M. Wallach
Legacy Trust (the Wallach Trust LOC ). The total outstanding balance on the Wallach LOC at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were
both 0. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on the Wallach LOC during 2022 was 0. Interest paid on the Wallach LOC
was less than 1,000 for both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total outstanding balance on the Wallach Trust
LOC as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on the Wallach Trust LOC during
2022 was 0. We have had no borrowings on the Wallach Trust LOC in 2022 or 2021. Each of the lines of credit is evidenced by a promissory
note, is payable upon demand of the lender, and generally bears an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 3 . Pursuant to each promissory
note, the lender has the option of funding any amount up to the face amount of the note, in the lender s sole and absolute discretion.
As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the interest rate was 10.50 and 6.25 for both the Wallach LOC and the Wallach Trust LOC. 

The
original entries into the Wallach LOC and the Wallach Trust LOC were approved by Mr. Wallach in his capacity as sole manager prior to
the time we had independent managers. As the demand loans were made at rates equal to the lenders cost of funds, Mr. Wallach determined
the terms of the demand loans to be as favorable to us as those generally available from unaffiliated third parties. The independent
managers ratified and approved these transactions subsequent to the formation of the board of managers. See Risk Factors 
Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Our CEO (who is also on our board of managers) and Executive Vice President will face
conflicts of interest as a result of the secured lines of credit made to us, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests
of our Note holders. In June 2018, the Company s board of managers (with Mr. Wallach abstaining) approved amendments to
the Wallach LOC and Wallach Trust LOC to change the interest rate on each to generally equal the prime rate plus 3 . 

During
June 2018, we entered into a line of credit agreement with our EVP William Myrick (the Myrick LOC Agreement ), which was
approved by the Company s board of managers. Pursuant to the Myrick LOC Agreement, Mr. Myrick provides us with a line of credit
(the Myrick LOC secured by a lien against all of our assets with the following terms with principal not to exceed 1,000,000.
The interest rate on the Myrick LOC is generally equal to the prime rate plus 3 . The Myrick LOC is due upon demand. As of December 31,
2022 and 2021, the amount outstanding pursuant to the Myrick LOC was 35,000 and 859,000, respectively. The largest aggregate amount
of principal outstanding on the Myrick LOC during 2022 and 2021 was 858,000 and 1,000,000, respectively. Interest expense was 24,000
and 6,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

During
2020 and 2019, we entered into one and four separate line of credit agreements, respectively (the New LOC Agreements ),
one of which was with R. Scott Summers, the son of Kenneth R. Summers, one of our independent managers. The Company s board of
managers approved the Company entering into the agreement which provides us with a line of credit secured with assignments of certain
notes and mortgages and a lien against all of our assets, and with principal not to exceed 2,000,000 which is R. Scott Summers portion
of the New LOC Agreements. The interest rate is 9 and terms include termination upon 30 days notice. As of December 31, 2022

The
Company has a Senior Subordinated Promissory Note to the father of Mr. Wallach in the principal amount of 375,000. The annual interest
rate on that promissory note is 10 and the lender may require us to repay 20,000 of principal and all unpaid interest with 10 days 
notice. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount outstanding pursuant to the promissory note was 375,000 and 333,000, respectively.
The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on the promissory note during 2022 and 2021 was 375,000 and 352,000, respectively.
Interest expense was 23,000 and 32,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Hoskins
Group s Series B Preferred Equity 

The
Series B cumulative preferred membership units Series B Preferred Units of our membership interests were first issued
to the Hoskins Group through a reduction in the amount owed by us on a loan in which a member of the Hoskins Group is the lender. They
are redeemable only at the option of the Company or upon a change or control or liquidation. The Series B Preferred Units have a fixed
value which is their purchase price, and preferred liquidation and distribution rights. Yearly distributions of 10 of the Series B Preferred
Units value (providing profits are available) will be made quarterly. The Hoskins Group s Series B Preferred Units are also
used as collateral for that group s loans to the Company. There is no liquid market for the Series B Preferred Units, so we can
give no assurance as to our ability to generate any amount of proceeds from that collateral. In December 2015, the Hoskins Group agreed
to purchase 0.1 Series B Preferred Units upon each closing of a lot sale in the subdivisions in which we lend the Hoskins Group development
funds. The Hoskins Group purchased 1.8 and 1.4 Series B Preferred Units in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

See
Note 14, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements, for information regarding the redemption of our Series B Preferred
Units subsequent to December 31, 2022. 

Series
C Preferred Equity 

Investors
in the Series C cumulative preferred units Series C Preferred Units may elect to reinvest their distributions in additional
Series C Preferred Units (the Series C Reinvestment Program ). Pursuant to the Series C Reinvestment Program, as of December
31, 2022, we have issued approximately 2.29 Series C Preferred Units to Daniel M. Wallach, our CEO, for distribution proceeds of approximately
 229,000 and we have issued approximately 0.74 Series C Preferred Units to Gregory L. Sheldon for distribution proceeds of approximately
 74,000. During 2021, Mr. Sheldon invested an additional 200,000 in Series C Preferred Equity. 

The
Series C Preferred Units have a fixed value which is their purchase price and preferred liquidation and distribution rights. Yearly distributions
of 12 of the Series C Preferred Units value (provided profits are available) will be made on a quarterly basis. This rate can
increase if any interest rate on our public Notes offering rises above 12 . Dividends can be reinvested monthly into additional Series
C Preferred Units. The Series C Preferred Units have the same preferential rights as the Series B Preferred Units as more fully described
above. 

See
Note 14, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements, for information regarding the redemption of our Series C Preferred
Units subsequent to December 31, 2022. 

Sale
of Commercial Loans 

During
2021, Mr. Myrick purchased two loans from the Company for approximately 141,000 and both loans were serviced by the company as of December
31, 2021. One loan paid off during 2022 and the second loan was serviced by the Company as of December 31, 2022. In addition, during
2022, Mr. Myrick purchased one loan for approximately 24,000 after which it was sold to Mr. Wallach and as of December 31, 2022 this
loan was serviced by the Company. 

During
2021, Mr. Sheldon purchased one loan from the Company for 405,000. The loan paid off during 2022 and the proceeds were used to purchase
another loan for 417,000. The loan was serviced by the company as of December 31, 2022. 

Affiliate
Transaction Policy 

Our
limited liability company agreement provides that any future transaction involving the Company and an affiliate must be approved by a
majority vote of independent managers not otherwise interested in the transaction upon a determination of such independent managers that
the transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from an independent third party. An approval pursuant
to this policy shall be set forth in the minutes of the Company and shall include a description of the transaction approved. The responsibility
for reviewing and approving affiliate transactions has been delegated to the nominating and corporate governance committee of our board
of managers, which is comprised entirely of independent managers. 

Pursuant
to our limited liability company agreement, we must provide the independent managers with access, at our expense, to our legal counsel
or independent legal counsel, as needed. 

Board
of Managers Independence 

We
have no securities listed for trading on a national securities exchange or in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national
securities association, which has requirements that a majority of our board of managers be independent. For purposes of complying with
the disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have adopted the definition of independence used by the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Under the NYSE s definition of independence, Messrs. Summers, Rauscher, and Sheldon each meet the definition
of independent.

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 

Our
Audit Committee reviewed the audit services performed by Warren Averett for 2022 and 2021. The aggregate agreed-upon and billed fees
for professional accounting services provided by Warren Averett, including the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements,
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are set forth in the table below. 

2022 
 2021 
 
 Audit Fees 
 178,850 
 149,000 

For
purposes of the preceding table, the professional fees are classified as follows: 

Audit
 Fees - These are fees for professional services performed for the audit of our annual financial statements and the required review
 of our quarterly financial statements and other procedures performed by the independent auditors to be able to form an opinion on
 our consolidated financial statements. These fees also cover services that are normally provided by independent auditors in connection
 with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, and services that generally only an independent auditor reasonably can provide,
 such as services associated with filing registration statements, periodic reports, and other filings with the SEC. 

Pre-Approval
Policies 

The
Audit Committee charter imposes a duty on the Audit Committee to pre-approve all auditing services performed for us by our independent
auditors, as well as all permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) in order to ensure that the provision of
such services does not impair the auditor s independence. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the Audit Committee
considers whether the service is permissible under applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee may, in its discretion, delegate one or
more of its members the authority to pre-approve any services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, provided
such pre-approval is presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. 

All
services rendered by Warren Averett for the year ended December 31, 2022 were pre-approved in accordance with the policies set forth
above.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Shepherd s Finance, LLC as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in members capital, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Shepherd s Finance, LLC as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Shepherd s Finance, LLC s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on Shepherd s Finance, LLC s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect
to Shepherd s Finance, LLC in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. Our performance obligations to customers are primarily
satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the customer. 

and for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Foreclosed
Assets 

Foreclosed
assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment) are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

Foreclosed
assets, upon initial recognition, are measured and reported at fair value less cost to sell. Each reporting period, the Company remeasures
the fair value of its significant foreclosed assets. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the foreclosed
assets or management s estimates of value, which the Company classifies as a Level 3 evaluation.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC
825 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet,
for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the
fair value of its financial instruments: 

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Loans
Receivable and Commitments to Extend Credit 

For
variable rate loans that reprice frequently with no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values of collateral are based
on carrying values at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Because the loans are demand loan and therefore have no known time horizon, there
is no significant impact from fluctuating interest rates. For unfunded commitments to extend credit, because there would be no adjustment
between fair value and carrying amount for the amount if actually loaned, there is no adjustment to the amount before it is loaned. The
amount for commitments to extend credit is not listed in the tables below because there is no difference between carrying value and fair
value, and the amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability. 

Interest
Receivable 

Interest
receivable from our customers is due approximately 15 days after it is billed; therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Customer
Interest Escrow 

The
customer interest escrow does not yield interest to the customer, but the fair value approximates the carrying value at both December
31, 2022 and 2021 because: 1) the customer loans are demand loans, 2) it is not possible to estimate how long the escrow will be in place,
and 3) the interest rate which could be used to discount this amount is negligible. 

Borrowings
under Credit Facilities 

The
fair value of the Company s borrowings under credit facilities is estimated based on the expected cash flows discounted using the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. As all of the borrowings under credit facilities or the
Notes are either payable on demand or at similar rates to what the Company can borrow funds for today, the fair value of the borrowings
is determined to approximate carrying value at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The interest on our Notes offering is paid to our Note
holders either monthly or at the end of their investment, compounded on a monthly basis. For the same reasons as the determination for
the principal balances on the Notes, the fair value approximates the carrying value for the interest as well.

and in addition, paid a management fee for the development of homes on the
lots. The management fee was paid through reducing the principal balance on a current loan receivable with the borrower. Two of the four

the home is built during the course of the loan, the loan balance increases. The loans carry an interest rate of above our cost
of funds. In addition, we charge a loan fee and our cost of funds was as of December 31, 2022. 

Our
loans are demand loans and most have a deposit from the builder during construction to help offset the risk of partially built homes,
and some have an interest escrow to offset payment of monthly interest risk.

 to recover the loan balance. In addition, a portion of the collateral value is estimated based on the selling prices anticipated
 for the homes.

Credit
Quality Information 

The
following table presents credit-related information at the class level in accordance with FASB ASC 310-10-50, Disclosures
about the Credit Quality of Finance Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses . A class is generally a disaggregation of a portfolio
segment. In determining the classes, the Company considered the finance receivable characteristics and methods it applies in monitoring
and assessing credit risk and performance. 

The
following table summarizes finance receivables by the risk ratings that regulatory agencies utilize to classify credit exposure and which
are consistent with indicators the Company monitors. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted as necessary for updated
information affecting the borrowers ability to fulfill their obligations. 

The
definitions of these ratings are as follows: 

Pass
 finance receivables in this category do not meet the criteria for classification in one of the categories below. 

Special
 mention a special mention asset exhibits potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
 these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects. 

Classified
 a classified asset ranges from: 1) assets that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity
 of the borrower, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected
 to 2) assets with weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full unlikely on the basis of current facts, conditions, and
 values. Assets in this classification can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of these factors.

Purchase and Sale Agreements 

We
have two loan purchase and sale agreements where we are the seller of portions of loans we create. The two purchasers are Builder Finance,
Inc. Builder Finance and S.K. Funding, LLC S.K. Funding ). Generally, the purchasers buy between and
 of each loan sold. They receive interest rates ranging from our cost of funds to the interest rate charged to the borrower (interest
rates were between and for both 2022 and 2021). The purchasers generally do not receive any of the loan fees we charge. We have
the right to call some of the loans sold, with some restrictions. Once sold, the purchaser must fund their portion of the loans purchased.
We service the loans. Also, there are limited put options in some cases, whereby the purchaser can cause us to repurchase a loan. The
loan purchase and sale agreements are recorded as secured borrowings.

timing of the Company s principal and interest payments to S.K. Funding under the Seventh Amendment, and S.K. Funding s obligation
to fund the Pennsylvania Loans, vary depending on the total principal amount of the Pennsylvania Loans outstanding at any time, as follows: 

The
 interest rate accruing to S.K. Funding under the Seventh Amendment is calculated on a 365/366-day basis. 

The
Seventh Amendment had a term of 24 months and automatically renews for additional six-month terms unless either party gives written notice
of its intent not to renew at least six months prior to the end of a term. S.K. Funding will have a priority position as compared to
the Company in the case of a default by any of the borrowers.
