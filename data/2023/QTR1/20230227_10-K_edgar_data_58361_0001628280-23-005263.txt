 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Lee Enterprises, Incorporated, together with its subsidiaries, Lee , the Company , we , our or us is a digital-first subscription platform providing local markets with valuable, high quality, trusted, intensely local news, information, advertising and marketing services. We are a rapidly growing digital subscription platform with more than 530,000 digital subscribers serving 77 mid-sized local communities in 26 states. Our core strategy aims to grow digital audiences and engagement through continuous improvements to subscriber experience, while offering a full suite of omni-channel advertising and marketing solutions local advertisers desire. 
 Our product portfolio includes digital subscription platforms, daily, weekly and monthly newspapers and niche publications, all delivering original local news and information. Our products offer print and digital editions, and our content and advertising is available in real time through our websites and mobile apps. We operate in predominately mid-sized communities with products ranging from large daily newspapers and associated digital products, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The Buffalo News , to non-daily newspapers with news websites and digital platforms serving smaller communities. 
 We have made talent and technology investments to improve user experience, content, data visualization, and marketing to align with the shift in spending habits to digital products by both consumers and advertisers. In 2022, total digital revenues, which includes digital advertising and marketing services revenues, digital-only subscription revenues, and digital services revenues, were 240 million, or 31 of our total revenues. 
 We aim to grow our business through three main categories: subscriptions to our product offerings, advertising and marketing solutions to local advertisers, and digital services to a diverse set of customers. Execution of this strategy is expected to transform Lee into a vibrant, digitally centric company. 
 Our digital subscription platforms are the fastest growing digital subscription platforms in local media. At the end of 2022, we had more than 530,000 subscribers to our digital platforms, up 32 over 2021. Revenue from digital only subscribers totaled more than 40 million in 2022, up 42 over 2021. 
 Amplified Digital ("Amplified"), our digital marketing services agency, offers a full suite of digital marketing solutions to local advertisers. Revenue at Amplified totaled almost 76 million in 2022, up 83 over 2021. 
 BLOX Digital (formerly known as TownNews), our software as a service (SaaS) content platform, is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America. BLOX Digital represents a powerful opportunity to drive additional digital revenue by providing state-of-the-art web hosting and content management services to more than 2,000 customers who rely on BLOX Digital for their web, over-the-top display, mobile, video and social media products. Revenue at BLOX Digital, including intercompany revenue, totaled 31 million in 2022, and has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10.6 over the last ten years. 
 We generate revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services, subscriptions to our digital and print products, and digital services, primarily through our majority-owned subsidiary, BLOX DIgital. Our operations also provide printing and distribution of third-party publications. 
 On March 16, 2020, we completed the acquisition of BH Media Group, Inc. ("BH Media") and The Buffalo News, Inc. ("Buffalo News"), adding 31 local media operations and nearly doubling our audience size and total operating revenue. See Note 3 Acquisitions, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.

Table of Contents 

 Advertising and Marketing Services - In 2022, advertising and marketing services revenue of 366.4 million comprised 47 of total operating revenue. 
 There are two primary categories of print advertising revenue: local and national. 
 Local advertising takes the form of display advertising in daily and non-daily publications and preprinted advertising inserted in the publication. 
 National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print display advertising space, or from preprint advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market. 
 There are three main categories of digital advertising and marketing services revenue: digital media, digital classified and digital marketing services. 
 Digital media represents all display advertising delivered on our owned and operated digital products. 
 Digital classified represents digital advertising revenue associated with our classified partnerships including auto, employment, real estate, legal and obituaries. 
 Digital marketing services represents a full suite of marketing services provided through Amplified, including targeted display, video, OTT, custom content, web development, social media management, search, events, email marketing and other tactics. 
 Amplified remains a key strategic priority for us in 2023. Our sales force deploys an omni-channel sales approach that leverages the auction-based ad buying that is widely adopted by all major digital advertising channels, and tailors advertising and marketing solutions based on the size, scale, and needs of the advertiser. Through Amplified we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third-party sites that give advertisers the ability to target their message to reach their desired audiences. We collaborate with Google and other ad tech companies to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness. 
 Advertising and marketing services revenues are subject to moderate seasonality primarily due to fluctuations in advertising volumes tied to holidays and seasonal advertising. Our advertising and marketing services revenues are typically highest during the first quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the second quarter following the holiday season. 
 Subscription Revenue - In 2022, subscription revenue of 353.6 million comprised 45 of our total operating revenue. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from selling subscriptions to our content through our full access subscriptions, digital-only subscriptions and single copy sales. 
 Our full access subscriptions include access to all of our content on multiple platforms; including our print products delivered or made available to consumers, websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-editions with pricing varying significantly by market and by frequency. Consistent with general publishing industry trends, print subscription volumes declined in 2022. 
 We experienced rapid growth of our digital-only subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions include access to our content on our digital platforms. At the end of the fiscal year, we had 532,000 digital-only subscribers, up 32 compared to 2021, with revenue totaling 40 million, or up 42 compared to 2021. Growing our digital-only subscribers and digital-only revenue remains a top strategic priority in 2023. Our primary digital-only subscriber acquisition tactics include: 
 Converting our significant organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls, and dynamic meters; 
 Continuously improving our subscriber experience; and 
 Brand marketing campaigns to raise awareness to the desirability of our content. 
 A variety of pricing strategies are also used, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full price rate.

Table of Contents 

 Digital Services Revenue In 2022, digital services revenue of 18 million comprised 2.3 of our total operating revenue. In 2022, almost all of our digital services revenue is from BLOX Digital. BLOX Digital, operated through our 82.5 owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C., is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America and offers state of the art integrated digital publishing and content management solutions for creating, distributing, and monetizing multimedia content. 
 BLOX Digital is the engine that powers our digital products. In addition, BLOX Digital services nearly 2,000 daily customers, including legacy media publications, universities, television stations and niche publications. 
 Including intercompany revenue generated from our markets, revenue at BLOX Digital grew almost 14 in 2022 and totaled 31 million. 
 With strong product offerings, investments in video and streaming technology and diversifying the customer base into broadcast, BLOX Digital is positioned to continue to be a key component to our growth strategy. 
 Other Revenue - In 2022, Other Revenue of 60.9 million comprised 8 of total operating revenue. Excluding digital services revenue, other revenue is comprised mainly of commercial printing and delivery of third party products and until March 16, 2020 revenue from a Management Agreement between BH Media and the Company dated June 26, 2018 ("Management Agreement"). In 2022, other revenue excluding digital services of 18 million, comprised 5.5 of our total operating revenue, compared to 19 million and 6.1 in 2021. 
 We compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our print and digital products competed with other forms of media including national media providers and amateur content creators, as well as other news and information outlets for subscription spend. The market for local digital marketing solutions is highly competitive and evolving allowing opportunities for new competitors to enter the market. 
 Amplified competes with other digital marketing solutions agencies as well as other media companies who have a similar strategy for digital marketing solutions. While some of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer histories as well as greater financial resources, we believe we compete favorably and our product capabilities meet customer requirements due to our data-driven, omni-channel sales approach, our experienced digital sales force and our overall customer satisfaction. 
 The number of competitors in any given market varies; however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in all of our markets. 
 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 
 We are committed to a strategy that transforms Lee into a vibrant, digitally-centric business with recurring, sustainable digital revenue. Aligning with that commitment, our Three Pillar Digital Growth Strategy is focused on the following: 
 Expand digital audiences by transforming the presentation of local news and information. We seek to maintain our position as the leading provider of news and information by providing best-in-class digital experiences to improve consumer engagement and grow our audiences. We aim to achieve this by delivering relevant, useful, and engaging content to the consumer using a multi-media approach with a heavy emphasis on video and audio. 
 In 2023, we plan to continuously improve the user experience with our digital products through targeted investments in top talent aimed at investigative journalism. Providing our local consumers with more and more high quality, trusted, engaging content is important to growing our digital audiences and driving subscription conversions. 
 We believe that our proprietary local content displayed in best-in-class multimedia platforms combined with new and engaging content and video channels will grow our audiences and increase our audience monetization capabilities. 
 Expand digital subscription base and revenue. We are the fastest growing digital subscription platform in local media. Digital-only subscriber growth continued at a rapid pace in 2022, offsetting the declines in our

 traditional full access (print and digital) subscribers. Our digital audiences are comprised of full access subscribers, digital-only subscribers and non-subscribers who access our sites subject to our paywalls. More than 53 of our full access subscribers have activated their digital access, and digital-only subscribers increased 32 in 2022, reaching 532,000 digital-only subscribers. 
 Our acquisition and retention tactics are focused on growing our digital subscription base by using data and analytics to direct our huge addressable market of 34 million unique visitors toward obtaining a digital subscription. In 2023, our primary digital-only subscriber acquisition tactics include: 
 Converting our significant organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls, and dynamic meters; 
 Continuously improving our subscriber experience; and 
 Brand marketing campaigns to raise awareness to the desirability of our content. 
 Using these techniques, we expect digital-only subscribers to continue to grow substantially, reaching more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers by 2026. 
 We believe our digital transformation will have a favorable impact on the environment. A key component to our digital growth strategy is to accelerate the pace of digital subscriber growth. Growing our digital revenue streams as the print revenues mature will have a favorable impact on the environment as our production hubs will consume less energy, we will consume less newsprint, and there will be less environmental impact from our distribution channels that largely operate on fossil-fuel powered transportation. 
 Diversify and expand offerings for local advertisers. According to eMarketer, local advertising spending is expected to reach nearly 115 billion in 2023. Our vast array of rapidly growing digital products, our large, digitally adept salesforce and Amplified, our full service digital agency, creates a powerful opportunity to gain scale both in and outside of our local markets. 
 Our local sales forces are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets. 
 We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver our advertisers' message. 
 Amplified remains a key strategic priority for us in 2023 as we expect it to fuel growth of our digital advertising and marketing services. Our salesforce deploys an omni-channel sales approach that leverages the auction-based ad buying that is widely adopted by all major digital advertising channels, and tailors advertising and marketing solutions based on the size, scale, and needs of the advertiser. Through Amplified we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third-party sites that give advertisers the ability to target their message to reach their desired audiences. We collaborate with Google and other ad tech companies to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness. 
 BLOX Digitals represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue through their SaaS content platform. In 2022, revenue at BLOX Digital, including intercompany revenue, totaled 31 million and since 2011 the compounded annual growth rate of BLOX Digital revenue has been 11 . Through continuous investment in product development and gaining essential technology, like world-class video and streaming technology, BLOX Digital is the leading CMS provider in the publishing CMS segment and is growing its market share in the broadcast CMS segment. In 2023, we believe we can grow revenue at BLOX Digital through modest market share gains in our core markets, increasing our average revenue per customer.

 NEWSPRINT 
 The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can affect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , included herein. 
 EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We believe the foundation of our business is the people and employees who carry out the various tactics that support our business strategy. A major focus in 2022 was investing in the top digital talent to carry out our Three Pillar Digital Growth Strategy and position us to achieve our long-term growth targets 
 At September 25, 2022, we had approximately 4,365 employees, including approximately 788 part-time employees, exclusive of TNI and MNI. Full-time equivalent employees in 2022 totaled approximately 4,064 of which 722 are represented by unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We are committed to an equitable and inclusive workplace that also reflects the diversity of our local readers and communities in which we serve. In 2021, we hired a Director of News and Talent Development who is charged with improving diversity in our newsrooms and hiring practices that promote a more complete and inclusive news coverage of the communities in which we serve. 
 We continue to demonstrate our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by assessing our hiring practices, extending our hiring reach, providing skill-building opportunities on diverse storytelling, and developing business strategies that include historically marginalized communities. These efforts and initiatives will help us reach our goal of a more diverse workforce at all levels of our company.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S., as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Item 8 of this Report. For ease of review, the risk factors generally have been grouped into categories, but many of the risks described in a given category relate to multiple categories. 
 Risks Related to our Business and Operations 
 Our advertising revenues may decline due to weakness in the brick-and-mortar retail sector. 
 A significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising. The demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic strength, both in the markets in which we operate and nationally. Also, the decline in the financial or economic conditions of our advertisers could alter discretionary spending by advertisers. Certain segments of the economy have been challenged in recent years, particularly in the brick-and-mortar retail sector, and total advertising revenues have declined as a result. Advertising revenues may worsen if advertisers reduce their budgets, shift their spending priorities, are forced to consolidate, or cease operations. 
 Our ability to generate revenue is highly sensitive to the strength of the economies in which we operate and the demographics of the local communities that we serve. 
 Our advertising and marketing services revenues and subscription revenues depend upon a number of factors, including the size and demographic characteristics of the local population; the general local economic conditions; and the economic condition of the retail segments in the communities that our publications serve. In the case of an economic downturn in a market, our publications, revenues, and profitability in that market could be adversely affected. Our advertising and marketing services revenues could also be affected by negative trends in the general economy that affect consumer spending. The advertisers in our newspapers, other publications, and related websites are primarily retail businesses that can be significantly affected by regional or national economic downturns and other developments. Declines in the U.S. economy could also significantly affect key advertising revenue categories, such as help wanted, real estate, and automotive. 
 Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate and increases in costs of raw materials, energy, labor and other factors may negatively affect our business. 
 The U.S. markets have weakened recently and are experiencing uncertainty and volatility due to higher inflation, increased interest rates, the war in Ukraine, the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and other geopolitical events. In the past, these and other similar conditions have resulted in, and could lead to a tightening of credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, lower consumer and business spending due to wavering of consumer confidence, unemployment, declines in real estate values, and other adverse economic conditions. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with publishing and distributing our publications. In addition, printing and distribution costs, including the costs of paper and ink, are a significant expense for the Company. We expect increases in these costs in the near-term from various factors, including increases in the cost of raw materials, energy, labor, transportation, and distribution, which can be attributed to inflation and other adverse factors on the economy. 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm the business and trading price of our common stock. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with Section 404 may 
 9 

Table of Contents 

 require us to incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing has revealed and in the future may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq, or other applicable regulatory authorities. 
 We have identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the Company and a negative impact on the value of our common stock. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2022, and concluded we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified three material weaknesses, including controls related to user access of our systems, information used by us in performing internal controls, and deferred taxes related to business combinations. For additional information, see Item 9A, "Controls and Procedures," below. 
 Until remediated, the material weaknesses could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which could negatively affect investor confidence in the Company and, in turn, the value of our common stock. While certain actions have been taken and planned to remediate and address the material weaknesses and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be certain such remedial measures will be successful or otherwise sufficient to address the material weaknesses. In addition, if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which, in addition to loss of investor confidence and a negative affect on the value of our common stock, could subject the Company to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities requiring additional financial and management resources to address. 
 The collectability of accounts receivable under adverse economic conditions could deteriorate to a greater extent than provided for in our financial statements and in our projections of future results. 
 Adverse economic conditions in the U.S. may increase our exposure to losses resulting from financial distress, insolvency, and the potential bankruptcy of our advertising and marketing services customers. Our accounts receivable is stated at net estimated realizable value, and our allowance for credit losses has been determined based on several factors, including receivable agings, significant individual credit risk accounts, and historical experience. If such collectability estimates prove inaccurate, adjustments to future operating results could occur. 
 The value of our intangible assets may become further impaired, depending upon future operating results. 
 At September 25, 2022, the carrying value of our goodwill was 329.5 million, the carrying value of mastheads was 26.3 million, and the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets was 95.0 million. The indefinite-lived assets (goodwill and mastheads) are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in our circumstances that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary in the relevant period. We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders equity. 
 For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 6 Goodwill and other intangible assets.

 Attracting and Retaining Highly Qualified Personnel is Difficult and Costly, but the Failure to Do So Could Negatively Affect Our Operations. 
 Our businesses depend on the efforts, abilities, and talents of our executive team and other highly qualified employees who possess substantial business, information technology, and operational knowledge. The market for such personnel, including technology-related, product and software development, data science, and digital marketing and sales roles is very competitive, and we cannot ensure success in retaining these employees or hiring and training replacement employees in a timely and cost-effective manner, particularly as we continue to focus on our digital products and services. These risks have been exacerbated by recent labor constraints, a trend of increasing employee turnover, and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits. 
 Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, derecho windstorms, floods, earthquakes, wildfires; acts of terrorism or violence, including active-shooter situations; and public health issues, including pandemics and quarantines, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, disruptions to our IT systems, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from our suppliers, and delays in the delivery of goods to our printing facilities. Public health issues, whether occurring in the U.S. or Canada, could disrupt our operations, the operations of suppliers, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. 
 Risk Related to Competition from Digital Media 
 Our operating revenue may be materially adversely affected if we do not successfully respond to the shift in newspaper readership and advertising expenditures away from traditional print media and towards digital media. Significant capital investments may be needed to respond to this shift. 
 Currently, a primary source of revenue is from advertising and marketing services, which accounts for 47 of our revenue. Subscription revenue accounts for 45 of our revenue. The media publishing industry has experienced rapid evolution in consumer demands and expectations due to advances in technology, which have led to a proliferation of delivery methods for news and information. The number of consumers who access online services through devices other than personal computers, such as tablets and mobile devices, has increased dramatically in recent years and likely will continue to increase. The media publishing industry also continues to be affected by demographic shifts, with older generations preferring more traditional print newspaper delivery and younger generations consuming news through digital media. Also, the revenues generated by media publishing companies have been affected significantly by the shift in advertising expenditures towards digital media. 
 The future revenue performance of our digital business depends to a significant degree upon the growth, development, and management of our subscriber and advertising audiences. The growth of our digital business over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to: 
 Continue to increase digital audiences; 
 Attract advertisers to our digital platforms; 
 Tailor our products to efficiently and effectively deliver content and advertising on mobile devices; 
 Maintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital platforms; 
 Exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services; 
 Invest funds and resources in digital opportunities; 
 Partner with, or use services from, providers that can assist us in effectively growing our digital business; and 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 Create digital content and platforms that attract and engage audiences in our markets. 
 If we are unable to grow our digital audience, distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or develop compelling new products and services that engage users across multiple platforms, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Responding to the changes described above may require us to make significant capital investments and incur significant research and development costs related to building, maintaining, and evolving our technology infrastructure, and our ability to make the level of investments required may be limited. 
 See Audiences in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on about our print and digital audiences. 
 We compete with a large number of companies in the local media industry, including digital media businesses and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our advertising and subscription revenues may decline. 
 We compete for audiences and advertising revenue with newspapers and other media such as the internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, outdoor billboards and yellow pages. As the use of the internet and mobile devices has increased, we have lost some classified advertising and subscribers to online advertising businesses and our free Internet sites that contain abbreviated versions of our publications. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we fail to compete effectively with competing newspapers and other media, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Takeover Attempts 
 Alden s unsolicited proposal to acquire us diverted management s attention and resources, caused us to incur substantial costs, and such actions have an adverse effect on our business. 
 On November 22, 2021, we received an unsolicited proposal from Alden Global Capital, LLC (with its affiliates, Alden to acquire the Company for 24.00 per share in cash (the Unsolicited Proposal ). On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors, in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined to reject the Unsolicited Proposal, as it significantly undervalued the Company and was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
 The events surrounding the Unsolicited Proposal and related circumstances and our response have required, and may continue to require, significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors and have required us, and may continue to require us, to incur significant legal and advisory fees and expenses. Further, actions taken by Alden or other third parties as a result of the Unsolicited Proposal, including a proxy contest, and litigation by adverse parties, could disrupt our business, distract us from efforts to improve our business, cause us to incur substantial additional expense, create perceived uncertainties among current and potential employees, customers, clients, suppliers, and other constituencies as to our future direction as a consequence thereof that may result in lost sales or other business arrangements and the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Actions that our Board of Directors have taken, and may take in the future, in response to any offer or other related actions by Alden or other third parties, including the Unsolicited Proposal and Alden s purported notice of nominations in connection with our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (which our Board of Directors determined was invalid for failing to comply with requirements of our by-laws), or any other offer or proposal may result in litigation against us. In the event Alden or other third parties initiate litigation against us, these actions could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also believe the future trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on uncertainty associated with the Unsolicited Proposal and any future offer. 
 Risks Related to our Acquisitions of BH Media and Buffalo News 
 On March 16, 2020, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the newspaper and related community publications business of BH Media and the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Buffalo News (collectively, the Transactions ). Under the terms of the Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 29, 2020, with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. Berkshire ), and BH Media (the Purchase Agreement ), the aggregate purchase price for the Transactions was 140 million, which excluded 12 million in cash at closing of the Transactions. BH Finance, LLC BH Finance ), an affiliate 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 of Berkshire, financed the Purchase Agreement through a Credit Agreement, dated January 29, 2020 (the Credit Agreement ). 
 The Company borrowed 576 million from BH Finance under the Credit Agreement in order to finance the Transactions and refinance its outstanding indebtedness. 
 We may not achieve the intended benefits of the BH Media and Buffalo News acquisition. 
 We completed the BH Media and Buffalo News acquisition in March 2020, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the expected benefits of the transaction. 
 There are many challenges associated with integrating a material acquisition, such as our acquisition of BH Media and Buffalo News, including the integration of executive and other employee teams with historically different cultures and priorities; the coordination of personnel located across multiple geographic locations; retaining key management and other employees; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition. These and other challenges could result in unanticipated operational challenges and the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe or at all. 
 If we fail to realize anticipated synergies in the amount and within the timeframe expected, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from the illustrative unaudited financial information disclosed in connection with the acquisition, which was based on various assumptions and estimates that may prove to be incorrect. Such illustrative unaudited financial information did not constitute management s projections of future financial performance or results of operations; however, any material variance from such illustrative unaudited financial information could result in negative investor reactions that materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. 
 Our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially even if synergies are realized, due to macroeconomic factors or a variety of other risks to our business that are independent of the acquisition. 
 Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations. 
 With the completion of the BH Media acquisition, the size of our business increased significantly. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We cannot assure that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from the combination that we currently anticipate. 
 Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our debt. 
 If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we could face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, and capital expenditures or sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure investors we would be able to take any of these alternative actions, such actions would be permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement, and, even if successful,, that such actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, the subsequent default proceedings under the Credit Agreement could lead to all principal and interest becoming due and payable. 
 Risks Related to Cybersecurity 
 Our business, operating results, and reputation may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to legal and regulatory claims if there is a loss, destruction, disclosure, misappropriation, or alteration of or unauthorized access to data owned or maintained by us, or if we are the subject of a significant data breach or cyberattack. 
 We rely on our information technology and communications systems to manage our business data, including communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. These technologies and systems also help us manage many of our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and financial systems. Attempts to compromise information technology and communications systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches resulting from accidental events (such as human error) or deliberate attacks. Moreover, the techniques used to attempt attacks and the perpetrators of such attacks are constantly expanding. We face threats both from use of malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, advanced persistent threats, and phishing and denial-of-service attacks. The Company has complied with all applicable legal requirements relating to this activity. As cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, and as tools and resources become more readily available to malicious third parties, the Company will incur increased costs to secure its technology environment and there can be no guarantee that the Company s and our third-party vendors actions, security measures and controls designed to prevent, detect or respond to security breaches, to limit access to data, to prevent destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of data, or to limit the negative impact from such attacks, can provide absolute security against compromise. As a result, our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes may be lost, destroyed, disclosed, misappropriated, altered or accessed without consent and various controls, automated procedures and financial systems could be compromised. 
 A significant security breach or other successful attack could result in significant remediation costs, including repairing system damage, engaging third-party experts, deploying additional personnel or vendor support, training employees, and compensation or incentives offered to third parties whose data has been compromised. These incidents may also lead to lost revenues resulting from a loss in competitive advantage due to the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, destruction or use of business data, the failure to retain or attract customers, the disruption of critical business processes or systems, and the diversion of management s attention and resources. Moreover, such incidents may result in adverse media coverage, which may harm our reputation. These incidents may also lead to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions and private lawsuits, and related legal fees, as well as potential settlements, judgments and fines. We maintain insurance, but the coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 
 Our possession and use of personal information and the use of payment cards by our customers present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized access to or disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to liabilities and costly litigation and damage our reputation. 
 Our online systems store and process confidential subscriber and other sensitive data, such as names, email addresses, addresses, and other personal information. Therefore, maintaining our network security is critical. Additionally, we depend on the security of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized use of or inappropriate access to our, or our third-party service providers networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including payment card (credit or debit) information, of our customers. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers or users, cause interruption in our operations, or damage our computers or those of our customers or users. As a result of any such breaches, customers or users may assert claims of liability against us and these activities may subject us to legal claims, adversely 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 impact our reputation, and interfere with our ability to provide our products and services, all of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The coverage and limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. 
 A significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all amounts charged by us. These customers provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which, depending on the particular payment plan, may be maintained to facilitate future payment card transactions. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store, we could be liable to the banks that issue the payment cards for their related expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give our customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, our business would be seriously harmed. 
 There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or our third-party service providers, take will be effective in preventing a data breach. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers or users. Failure to protect confidential customer data or to provide customers with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to liabilities imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies or courts. We could also be subject to evolving state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Pension Liabilities 
 Sustained increases in funding requirements of our pension and postretirement obligations may reduce the cash available for our business. 
 Pension plans were in a net underfunded position of 0.4 million at September 25, 2022, compared to an over funded position of 13.4 million at September 26, 2021. 
 Our pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the securities markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension and postretirement plans. In addition, a decrease in the discount rates or changes to mortality estimates and other assumptions used to determine the liability could increase the benefit obligation of the plans. Unfavorable changes to the plan assets and/or the benefit obligations could increase the level of required contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our business and debt service. 
 We expect to be subject to additional withdrawal liabilities in connection with multiemployer pension plans, which may reduce the cash available for our business. 
 We contributed to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans during 2022 under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements CBAs ). For plans that are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply/or we could be required to make additional contributions.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters. While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, 
 RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Our Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ. 
 At November 30, 2022, we had 5,655 registered holders of record of our Common Stock. 
 Our Credit Agreement restricts us from paying dividends on our Common Stock. This restriction does not apply to dividends issued with the Company's Equity Interests or from the proceeds of a sale of the Company's Equity Interest. See Note 7 Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. 
 PERFORMANCE PRESENTATION 
 The following graph compares the percentage change in the cumulative total return of the Company, the Standard Poor's 500 Stock Index, and a peer group index, in each case for the five years ended September 25, 2022 (with September 24, 2017, as the measurement point).

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the year ended September 25, 2022, and for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included herein. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most subjective and complex judgments. 
 Intangible Assets, Other Than Goodwill 
 Local mastheads (e.g., publishing periodical titles, web site domain names, and trade names) are not subject to amortization. Non-amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest the asset might be impaired. 
 The quantitative impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of each masthead or domain name with its carrying amount. We use a relief from royalty approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each masthead, domain name, or trade name. Management's judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the intangibles fair values are consistently applied to each underlying business in determining the fair value of each intangible asset. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized impairment charges of 13,503,000, 787,000, and 972,000, respectively. Only one of our mastheads has a fair value that has headroom under 20 over their carrying value and could experience immaterial impairment in the future if we do not achieve our revenue projections. 
 Our amortizable intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships including subscriber lists and advertiser relationships. These asset values are amortized systematically over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group. In 2021, we recognized 190,000 of impairment on intangible assets subject to amortization. There were no indicators of impairment on intangible assets subject to amortization in 2022 or 2020. 
 Our quantitative impairment analysis includes several inputs that are considered estimates, these include royalty rates, discount rates, five-year revenue forecast, and long term growth rates. All of these estimates are subject to uncertainty as future results may or may not be achieved. The royalty rates utilized range from 0 to 1.5 , a 50 basis point decrease in royalty rates would result in an additional 6,992,000 of impairment. The Company s discount rate utilized in the analysis has ranged from 9.50 to 11.50 in different years depending on market conditions. Increasing the discount rate by 100 basis points would result in an additional 257,000 of impairment. The Company has had various revenue forecasts utilized in the analysis over different years. 
 Future decreases in our market value, or significant differences in revenue, expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value, could result in additional masthead impairment charges in the future. 
 Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans 
 We, along with our subsidiaries, have various defined benefit retirement plans, postretirement plans and postemployment plans, under which substantially all of the benefits have been frozen in previous years. 
 We account for our pension, postretirement and postemployment plans in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, which requires us to include the funded status of our pension plans in our balance sheets

 and to recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), the gains or losses that arise during the period but are not recognized in pension expense. The service cost component of net period benefit cost is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and included in Compensation while all other components are included in other non-operating income/expense. 
 The determination of pension and postretirement plan obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the discount rates applied to pension and postretirement plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. 
 The discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. To determine the expected long-term rate of return of assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets, input from the actuaries and investment consultants and long- term inflation assumptions. In 2022, we used an expected return of assets assumption of 5.0 for both our pension plan assets and our postretirement and postemployment benefit plan assets. 
 A 50 basis point change in discount rates would result in an increase to pension and postretirement and postemployment benefits liabilities of 12,100,000. A 50 basis point change in expected rate of return of assets results would result in an increase to pension and postretirement and postemployment benefits expense of 1,137,000. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and record our tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in our reported results of operations. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any. 
 Our current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted, if needed, throughout the year. Adjustments between our estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified. 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
 We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 
 Business Combinations 
 Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. The Company prepares its initial estimates of the fair values of intangible assets utilizing the multi-period excess earnings method for customer-related intangible assets and the relief from royalty method for indefinite lived

 masthead assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: 
 future expected cash flows from subscription, advertising and commercial print relationships and related assumptions about future revenue growth and customer retention; 
 discount rates; and 
 royalty rates used to value acquired mastheads. 
 Additional information regarding our accounting for business combinations can be found in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards issued and/or adopted in the year ended September 25, 2022. 
 
 CERTAIN MATTERS AFFECTING CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS 
 The following items affect period-over-period comparisons from 2022 to 2020 and will continue to affect period-over-period comparisons for future results. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 In March 2020, we completed the acquisition of BH Media and Buffalo News for a purchase price of 140,000,000. The acquisition was funded by a 25-year term loan with BH Finance, in an aggregate principal amount of 576,000,000 at a 9 annual rate (referred to herein as "Credit Agreement" and "Term Loan"), as part of a broader comprehensive refinancing of all of our then outstanding debt. 
 In the 13 weeks ended March 2020, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of certain of our smaller properties, including four daily newspapers and related print and digital publications, for an aggregate sales price of 3,950,000.

 Total operating expenses were 761.8 million, a 2.3 increase compared to 2021. Cash Costs were 692.8 million, a 1.0 increase compared to 2021. 
 Compensation expense decreased 13.1 million in 2022, or a 4.0 decrease compared to 2021. The decrease is attributable to reductions in full time employees ("FTEs") due to continued business transformation efforts, partially offset by investments in digital talent. 
 Newsprint and ink costs increased 0.3 million in 2022, or a 1.1 increase compared to 2021. This increase was attributable to higher newsprint prices offset by a declines in newsprint volumes. See Item 7A, Commodities , included herein, for further discussion and analysis of the impact of newsprint on our business. 
 Other operating expenses increased 19.3 million in 2022, or a 5.9 increase compared to 2021. Other operating expenses include all operating costs not considered to be compensation, newsprint and ink, depreciation and amortization, or restructuring costs and other. The largest components are costs associated with printing and distribution of our printed products, digital investments, digital cost of goods sold and facility expenses. The increase is attributable to increases in investments to fund our digital growth strategy partially offset by lower delivery and other print-related costs due to lower volumes of our print products. 
 Restructuring costs and other totaled 22.7 million and 7.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Restructuring costs and other in 2022 include severance costs, litigation expenses, restructuring expenses, and advisor expenses associated with the unsolicited offer in November 2021.

 Compensation expense increased 87.9 million in 2021, or a 36.2 increase compared to 2020. Compensation expense from the Transactions totaled 165.4 million and 86.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Compensation was up 0.1 on a pro forma basis. The modest increase was due to a one time furlough and compensation reductions for all employees in 2020 in response to COVID-19 of approximately 10 million, investments in digital talent made throughout 2021, and the lack of incentive compensation in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in FTEs due to business transformation initiatives.

 Assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other was a net expense of 8.2 million in 2021 compared to a net gain of 5.4 million in 2020. Impairment in 2021 and 2020 totaled 1.0 million and 1.0 million, respectively. Assets losses and gains are part the Company's ongoing real estate and non-core asset monetization. 
 Equity In Equity Investments 
 Equity in earnings of TNI and MNI decreased 0.8 million in 2022, or 11.8 , compared to 2021. Equity in earnings of TNI and MNI increased 3.0 million in 2021 compared to 2020. 
 
 NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES 
 Non-operating Income and Expense Comparison 2022-2021 
 Interest expense decreased 3.0 million, or 6.7 , to 41.8 million in 2022 due to lower debt balances. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding amortization of debt financing cost, was 9.0 in 2022 and 2021. 
 Included in other non-operating income and expense is income related to our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, which totaled 20.5 million and 33.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized a non-cash curtailment gain of 23.8 million and a reduction in our benefit obligation in 2021 by eliminating post-retirement medical coverage for certain employees. We recognized pension withdrawal costs in 2021 of 12.9 million in connection with the withdrawal from pension plans that covered certain employees. The withdrawal liabilities will be paid over the next 20 years. 
 During 2022 we notified certain participants in our defined benefit plans of changes to be made to the plans. The Company froze future benefits for an additional four of the defined benefit plans. The freeze of future benefits resulted in a non-cash curtailment gain of 1.0 million related to the four plans. In connect with the freeze the Company provided certain plan enhancements that resulted in an increase to our net pension liability 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 and a decrease to Accumulated Other Comprehensive income of 6.1 million. Additionally, the Company merged the six frozen plans into one defined benefit plan effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 
 During September of 2022, the Company, as sponsor of the Lee Enterprises Incorporated Pension Plan (the "Plan") executed an agreement pursuant to which the Plan used a portion of its assets to purchase annuities from an insurance company (the "Insurer") and thereby assumed 85,622,000 of the Plan's liabilities in exchange for 81,377,000 of Plan assets. The non-cash settlement gain of 4,245,000 is recorded in Pension and OPEB related benefit (cost) and other, net. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, we recorded a liability for the Warrants, issued in connection with the Warrant Agreement in previous years. We re-measured the liability to fair value each reporting period, with changes reported in other non-operating income (expenses). Due to the fluctuation in the price of our Common Stock and changes in interest rates, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability can change each period. We recorded non-operating income of 0.1 million and 0.3 million in 2022 and 2021 respectively, due to the change in fair value of the Warrants. 
 Non-operating Income and Expense Comparison 2021-2020 
 Interest expense decreased 3.0 million, or 6.2 , to 44.8 million in 2021 due to lower debt balances. Our weighted average cost of debt, excluding amortization of debt financing cost, was 9.0 in 2021 and 2020. We recognized no debt financing and administrative costs in 2021 compared to 12.0 million in 2020. Expenses in the prior year are due to writing off unamortized financing costs paid in conjunction with a prior refinancing. 
 Included in other non-operating income and expense is income related to our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, which totaled 33.3 million and 3.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized a non-cash curtailment gain of 23.8 million and a reduction in our benefit obligation in 2021 by eliminating post-retirement medical coverage for certain employees. We recognized pension withdrawal costs in 2021 of 12.9 million in connection with the withdrawal from pension plans that covered certain employees. The withdrawal liabilities will be paid over the next 20 years. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, we recorded a liability for the Warrants, issued in connection with the Warrant Agreement. We re-measured the liability to fair value each reporting period, with changes reported in other non-operating income (expenses). Due to the fluctuation in the price of our Common Stock and changes in interest rates, the estimated fair value of the warrant liability can change each period. We recorded non-operating income of 0.3 million and 0.8 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively, due to the change in fair value of the Warrants. 
 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSES 
 In 2022, we recorded income tax expense of 698,000, or 87.8 of pretax income and in 2021, we recorded an income tax expense of 7,255,000, or 22.6 of pretax income. In 2020, we recorded an income tax expense of 2,973,000, or 104.6 of pre-tax income. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for a discussion of the difference between the expected federal income tax rate and the actual tax rates. 
 
 NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 Net income was 0.1 million in 2022 compared to net income of 24.8 million in 2021. The decrease in net income is predominately due to cycling one-time non-cash benefits in 2021. In 2020, net loss was 0.1 million. 
 Diluted loss per share was 0.35 per share in 2022 compared to diluted earnings per share of 3.90 per share in 2021. In 2020, losses per share were 0.35 per share. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We use non-GAAP financial performance measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis. 
 In this report, we present Adjusted EBITDA and cash costs, which are non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude from our reported GAAP results the impact of certain items consisting primarily of

 restructuring charges and non-cash charges. We believe such expenses, charges, and gains are not indicative of normal, ongoing operations, and their inclusion in results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies. In the future, however, we are likely to incur expenses, charges, and gains similar to the items for which the applicable GAAP financial measures have been adjusted and to report non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Accordingly, exclusion of those or similar items in our non-GAAP presentations should not be interpreted as implying the items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. 
 We define our non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, as follows: 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that enhances financial statement users' overall understanding of the operating performance of the Company. The measure isolates unusual, infrequent, or non-cash transactions from the operating performance of the business. This allows users to easily compare operating performance among various fiscal periods and how management measures the performance of the business. This measure also provides users with a benchmark that can be used when forecasting future operating performance of the Company that excludes unusual, nonrecurring or one-time transactions. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the calculation used by stockholders and analysts to determine the value of our business when using the market approach, which applies a market multiple to financial metrics. It is also a measure used to calculate the leverage ratio of the Company, which is a key financial ratio monitored and used by the Company and its investors. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus non-operating expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, restructuring costs and other, stock compensation and our 50 share of EBITDA from TNI and MNI, minus equity in earnings of TNI and MNI. 
 Cash Costs represent a non-GAAP financial performance measure of operating expenses which are measured on an accrual basis and settled in cash. This measure is useful to investors in understanding the components of the Company s cash-settled operating costs. Cash Costs can be used by financial statement users to assess the Company's ability to manage and control its operating structure. Cash Costs are defined as compensation, newsprint and ink and other operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization, assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other, restructuring costs and other non-cash operating expenses and other non-operating expenses are excluded. 
 Tables reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to net income and Cash Costs to operating expenses, the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, are set forth below under the caption "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our operations have historically generated strong positive cash flow, and are expected to continue providing sufficient liquidity, together with cash on hand, to meet our future cash requirements, which primarily relate to operating expenses, interest expense and capital expenditures. A summary of our cash flows is included in the narrative below. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 3,429,000 in 2022 compared to 50,078,000 in 2021, a decrease of 46,649,000. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in operating results of 25,412,000 (defined as net income (loss) adjusted for non-working capital items) and a decrease in cash from working capital of 21,237,000, primarily related to unfavorable changes in accounts receivable and income taxes payable, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and pension and postretirement obligations. 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 50,078,000 in 2021 compared to 49,869,000 in 2020, an increase of 209,000. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in operating results of 48,590,000 (defined as net income (loss) adjusted for non-working capital items) offset by a decrease in cash from working capital of 48,381,000, primarily related to unfavorable changes in accounts receivable and income taxes payable, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and pension and postretirement obligations.

 Investing Activities 
 Cash required for investing activities totaled 6,337,000 in 2022 and 2,278,000 in 2021. Capital spending totaled 7,536,000 and 7,479,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Proceeds from sales of assets totaled 14,835,000 and 4,616,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Cash required for investing activities totaled 2,278,000 in 2021 and 118,176,000 in 2020. 2020 included 130,985,000 in spending related to the Transactions. Capital spending totaled 7,479,000 and 8,096,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Proceeds from sales of assets totaled 4,616,000 and 21,710,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 We anticipate that funds necessary for capital expenditures, which are expected to be 12,000,000 in 2023, and other requirements, will be available from internally generated funds. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash required for financing activities totaled 19,693,000 in 2022 and 55,421,000 in 2021, while cash provided by financing activities totaled 93,395,000 in 2020. Debt reduction accounted for the majority of the usage of funds in 2022 and 2020, while proceeds from the Transactions accounted for the funds provided in the 2020 period. 
 Excluding payments required from the Company's future excess cash flow (as defined in Note 7), the only required principal payments include payments from net cash proceeds from asset sales (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and payments upon certain instances of change in control. Current maturities of long-term debt are from excess cash flows. There are no other scheduled mandatory principal payments required under the Credit Agreement. 
 Liquidity 
 Our liquidity, consisting of cash on the balance sheet, totals 16.2 million at September 25, 2022. This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows from operations. We expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by existing cash and our cash flows, which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. 
 At September 25, 2022, the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals 462.6 million. 
 The 2020 Refinancing as defined in Note 7, significantly extended our debt maturity profile with final maturity of our debt in 2045. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 Our largest source of advertising and marketing services revenue, retail advertising, is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served. Historically, retail advertising is higher in the December and June quarters. Advertising and marketing services revenue is lowest in the March quarter. 
 
 INFLATION 
 Price increases (or decreases) for our products are implemented when deemed appropriate by us. We continuously evaluate price increases, productivity improvements, sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation.

 (1) Maturities of long-term debt are limited to mandatory payments. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. 
 (2) Interest expense includes an estimate of interest expense for the Term Note, until its maturity in March 2045. Interest expense under the Term Note is estimated using the 9.0 contractual rate applied to the outstanding balance as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. 
 The table above excludes future cash requirements for pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations. The periods in which these obligations will be settled in cash are not readily determinable and are subject to numerous future events and assumptions. See Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. 
 The contractual obligations above exclude unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . We are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for such matters. A substantial amount of our deferred income tax liabilities will not result in future cash payments. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below. 
 INTEREST RATES ON DEBT 
 Our debt structure is entirely fixed rate as of September 25, 2022. 
 COMMODITIES 
 Declining structural demand trends and the COVID-19 impact on our industry and advertising led North American newsprint producers' efforts to permanently reduce manufacturing capacity by approximately 60 of pre-pandemic levels. As a result producers are experiencing high capacity utilization and increased backlogs which in turn led to numerous price increases during 2021 and 2022. We are still experiencing rising costs in our operations. 
 Our long term supply strategy continues to align and concentrate the Company's purchases with those cost effective suppliers most likely to continue producing and supply newsprint to the North American market. Where possible the Company will align supply with the lowest cost material. 
 A 10 per tonne price increase for 27.7 pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before taxes of approximately 308,000 based on anticipated consumption in 2023 excluding consumption of TNI and MNI and the impact of LIFO accounting.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we concluded an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation the Company identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Due to the material weaknesses, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 In light of the material weaknesses described below, management performed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that our interim and annual consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Any internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date, using the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the Evaluation Date due to the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 The material weaknesses identified by the Company are described below: 
 Management did not maintain appropriately designed information technology general controls in the areas of user access for certain of its information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements and system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management did not maintain appropriately designed controls over data provided by third-party service organizations for which a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 report is not available. Specifically, management did not design and implement controls over the validation of the completeness and accuracy of information received from these service organizations and correspondingly relied upon by the Company in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Management did not maintain appropriately designed controls over validation of the accuracy of the tax basis associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in an immaterial error correction associated with the Company's previously issued consolidated financial statements. 
 BDO USA, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2022, which is included herein. As a result of the material weaknesses described above, such report includes an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2022. 
 Remediation Plans and Actions 
 Management is committed to remediating the material weaknesses that have been identified and maintaining an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures. These remediation efforts, summarized below, are intended to both address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance our overall financial control environment. In this regard, our initiatives include: 
 Establishing a project team to review, evaluate, and remediate material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's recently expanded Corporate Compliance function will lead management's efforts related to effective control design, documentation, and implementation, as well as remediate ineffective controls. 
 Undergoing a complete user access review related to our information technology systems to refine user roles and establish appropriate user access to various systems that the Company relies upon in its internal controls over financial reporting, which includes enhancing user access provisioning and monitoring controls to enforce appropriate system access and segregation of duties. 
 Providing training to relevant personnel reinforcing existing Company policies regarding user access and the steps and procedures required to perform the required reviews of access to Company systems. 
 Enhancing the design of internal controls around evaluating data provided by third-party service organizations for which a SOC 1, Type 2 is not available to validate completeness and accuracy. 
 Enhancing the design of internal controls to validate the accuracy of the tax basis for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including enhancing our record retention policy to include retaining documentation for complex tax items for as long as such tax items impact our consolidated financial statements. 
 The material weaknesses will be considered remediated when management concludes that, through testing, the applicable remedial controls are designed and implemented effectively. 
 When fully implemented and operational, we believe the measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediated and/or newly implemented internal controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these internal controls are operating effectively. We are working to have these material weakness remediated as soon as possible. 
 We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to review and assess our financial reporting controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. As we continue to evaluate and

 improve our internal control over financial reporting, our management may determine it is appropriate or necessary to take additional measures. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the 13 weeks ended September 25, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Lee Enterprises, Incorporated 
 Davenport, Iowa 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management s assessment. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of September 25, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ), and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses were identified regarding the following: 
 
 1. Management s failure to design and maintain effective information technology general controls relating to user access for certain of its information systems that are relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements and system of internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 2. Management s failure to design and implement effective controls over data provided by third-party service organizations for which a System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1 Type 2 report is not

Table of Contents 

 available. Specifically, management did not design and implement effective controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of information received from these service organizations and correspondingly relied upon by the Company in its revenue recognition process and the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 3. Management's failure to design and implement effective controls over validation of the accuracy of the tax basis associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that are relevant to the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 27, 2023 on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 References to we, our or us under Executive Compensation refer to the Executive Compensation Committee. 
 The following describes certain aspects, elements, and objectives of and information concerning the Company's executive compensation program with respect to the Company's NEOs in 2022. 
 2022 Corporate Performance Assessment 
 In 2022, the Company continued to grow digital revenue, managed print revenue in a difficult environment, controlled costs and significantly reduced debt. Significant results for the year included the following: 
 Total operating revenue was 781 million, down 2 versus the prior year. 
 Total Digital Revenue was 240 million, a 27 increase over the prior year, and represented 31 of our total operating revenue. 
 Digital-only subscription revenue increased 42 in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Digital advertising and marketing services revenue represented 50 of our total advertising revenue and totaled 181 million, a 28 increase over the prior year. Digital marketing services revenue at Amplified Digital fueled the growth, with revenue of 76 million, an 83 increase over the prior year. 
 Digital services revenue, which is predominantly BLOX Digital, totaled 18 million in the year. On a standalone basis, revenue at BLOX Digital totaled 31 million, a 14 increase over the prior year. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Operating expenses totaled 762 million and Cash Costs were up 1 . Rapidly rising prices, incremental investments in digital talent and technology tied to our digital growth strategy, and an increase in cost of goods sold attributed to revenue growth at Amplified Digital were partially offset by reductions in costs tied to our legacy print revenue streams. 
 Net income totaled 0.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA totaled 96 million. 
 The Named Executive Officers 
 The Company's NEOs include the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the other most highly compensated executive officer who was serving as an executive officer at September 25, 2022. In 2022, the NEOs were: 
 Kevin D. Mowbray President and Chief Executive Officer Timothy R. Millage Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Treasurer Nathan E. Bekke Operating Vice President, Vice President - Audience Strategy 
 Elements of Compensation 
 Our compensation program reinforces the key drivers of success in the Company s business. Our financial emphasis is on revenue and operating cash flow. We believe these two measures are key measures of long and short-term success in our industry. Compensation for our NEOs includes the following: 
 Salaries; 
 Annual cash incentives which are based, to a large extent, on annual performance of the Company and the operations the individual manages; 
 Discretionary cash bonus awards in those circumstances where we believe exceptional performance is not adequately rewarded under our annual cash incentive compensation program; 
 Long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options or restricted Common Stock awards that fully vest three years after grant; and 
 Benefits, including health, life and disability insurance, a 401(K) plan and a supplemental deferred compensation plan. 
 Our annual cash incentive program places a portion of NEO compensation at risk, based on performance criteria. In addition, stock options, when granted, are inherently performance-based because an option only has value if the stock price rises after the option is granted. In some instances, we also make restricted Common Stock awards conditioned on the achievement of one or more specified performance goals under our Incentive Compensation Program. 
 Say-On-Pay Proposals 
 At our 2017 annual meeting, we conducted a non-binding advisory vote of the shareholders on the frequency of advisory votes on the Company s compensation of its NEOs (the say-on-frequency vote). Of the 4,273,000 shares represented at the meeting, a plurality of approximately 41.0 of the shares represented at the meeting were voted in favor of a one-year frequency vote; 25.2 of such shares were voted in favor of a three-year frequency for such votes; and due to broker non-votes, approximately 32.8 of the shares represented at the meeting were not voted in favor of any alternative. 
 Due to the inconclusive nature of the advisory voting results, the Executive Compensation Committee considered several factors in making its determination regarding the frequency of advisory shareholder votes on the Company s executive compensation program. 
 In 2011, 2014, and 2017, the shareholders recommended, on an advisory basis, the approval of the compensation philosophy, policies and procedures employed by the Executive Compensation Committee, substantially as described herein (the say-on-pay vote). 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 In 2011, 2014, and 2017, 93.6 , 95.8 , and 95.4 of the votes cast were voted in favor of the say-on-pay proposal, respectively. 
 Shareholder engagement and feedback findings do not indicate any concerns with the Company s executive compensation program. 
 Shareholders who have concerns about executive compensation during the interval between say-on-pay votes are welcome to bring their specific concerns to the attention of the Board and the Executive Compensation Committee. 
 Consistent with the recommendation of the Board as set forth in the Company s proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting, the Board determined, after consideration, to continue holding an advisory shareholder vote on the compensation of the Company s NEOs every three years. This policy remains in effect until the say-on-frequency advisory vote regarding the compensation of the Company s NEOs at the Annual Meeting. The next scheduled say-on-pay advisory vote related to executive compensation matters will be conducted at the 2023 Annual Meeting and the Board is recommending a change to an annual say-on-pay frequency advisory vote in order to reflect market trends and best practices.

Employee contributions are limited to 45 of salary and bonus compensation. See Primary Benefits above for additional information with regard to the Non-Qualified Plan. 
 Change of Control, Employment and Other Agreements 
 In 2015, we entered into amended and restated employment agreements between the Company and eight senior executive officers, including all of our NEOs, with the exception of Messrs. Farris and Millage, who entered into such agreements in 2018. The employment agreements entitle these executives to severance and other benefits upon termination without cause or for good reason that becomes effective only upon a change of control. We approved the new agreements because we believe they better align our agreements with general industry change of control employment agreements. 
 A change of control is defined to include certain mergers and acquisitions, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, changes in the membership of the Company's Board and acquisition of 15 of the outstanding stock of the Company for the purpose of changing the control of the Company. The new agreements superseded agreements originally entered into in 1998 and amended and restated in 2008 and provide substantially lower benefits upon a change of control. 
 Absent a change of control, the agreements do not require the Company to retain the executives or to pay them any specified level of compensation or benefits, and they remain employees at will. 
 The agreements extend for two years from the date of signature. On each annual anniversary date of the agreements (each a Renewal Date ), the change of control period will be automatically extended so as to terminate two years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company gives notice to the executive that the change of control period will not be extended. 
 The agreements are subject to the following triggers: 
 The agreements become effective and the protective features vest upon a change of control or if an executive's employment is terminated as a consequence of such event. 
 The agreements provide that each executive is to remain an employee for a two-year period following a change of control of the Company unless the executive resigns for good reason or is terminated for cause, each as defined in the agreement. 
 Under the agreements, a termination pursuant to the terms of the change of control agreement triggers the following compensation and benefits for the executives: 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Employment Period Benefits 
 During the two-year employment period, the executives are entitled to: 
 An annual base salary, payable monthly in an amount at least equal to their highest monthly base salary during the year prior to the change of control; 
 An annual bonus, payable in a lump sum within 75 days following each fiscal year in an amount at least equal to their highest annual bonus in the three years prior to the change of control; 
 Continued participation in the Company's incentive, savings, retirement, and welfare benefit plans; and 
 Payment of expenses and fringe benefits (including office and support staff, tax and financial planning services, applicable club dues and use of an automobile and related expenses) to the extent paid or provided to such executive immediately prior to the change of control or to other peer executives of the Company. 
 Benefits Upon Termination 
 If the executive's employment is terminated during the two-year employment period other than for cause, death or disability, or the executive terminates employment for good reason, the executive will be entitled to the following benefits: 
 All accrued and unpaid annual base salary and annual bonus for the prior fiscal year payable in a lump sum within 30 days of termination; 
 A lump sum severance payment equal to the amount corresponding to the executive's title set forth in the following table: 
 CEO 3x annual base salary and highest recent annual bonus 
 Vice Presidents 1x annual base salary and highest recent annual bonus 
 A payment equal to the payment multiple above of the Company's average annual contributions on behalf of the executive under all defined contribution plans maintained by the Company during the three-year period immediately preceding the termination; 
 Any legal fees and expenses incurred by the executive in asserting legal rights in connection with the agreement; and 
 Continued welfare benefits for the period equal to the multiple of their base salary payable plus certain outplacement services. 
 Under the agreements, termination for cause means termination of the executive's employment due to the (1) willful and continued failure of the executive to perform substantially the executive's duties with the Company or one of its affiliates, or (2) the willful engaging by the executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. 
 Good reason means actions taken by the Company that result in a material negative change in the employment relationship, including a detrimental change in responsibilities, a reduction in salary or benefits or a relocation of office, as described in the agreement. 
 Excise Tax Cap on Payments 
 To reduce the impact of any excise tax imposed on the executive related to the change of control, the agreements also require the Company to cap the overall value of payments if such reduction results in a larger net after-tax payment than would result if such payments were not capped and subject to an excise tax. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 Other Provisions 
 For a period of one year after the agreements become effective, the executives are restricted from: 
 Disclosing the confidential information of the Company and its affiliates; 
 Competing against the Company and its affiliates; 
 Soliciting the customers of the Company and its affiliates; and 
 Soliciting the employees of the Company and its affiliates for employment and hiring them, unless the employee is responding to employment advertising of a general nature or unless approved by the President of the Company in advance. 
 There is no requirement in the agreements that the executives execute a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates. 
 Acquirer's Obligations 
 The agreements mandate that the Company require an acquirer to assume and satisfy the Company's obligations under the agreements. 
 Equity Awards 
 The Company's LTIP was amended to provide that, if a change of control occurs, for early vesting and exercise and issuance or payment will be subject to a double-trigger for the following awards to executives (subject to certain limits): 
 Awards of restricted Common Stock; 
 Stock options and stock grants; or 
 Amounts payable instead of such issuance in a lump-sum payment within 30 days of surrender of such stock options to the Company. 
 Generally, vesting and payment will not occur if replacement awards equal in value and vesting terms are granted to the affected executive in connection with the change of control, unless the executive is thereafter terminated within the specified protection period. 
 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
 The following summarizes information as of September 25, 2022, related to estimated potential cash payments upon a change of control to the NEOs. Amounts in the table do not reflect income tax benefits that may be realized by the Company.

 (1) Cash compensation in excess of the 2022 annual retainer represents payment for directors as a committee chair or, in the case of Mr. Moloney, for his service as Lead Director. 
 (2) All restricted stock awards are fully vested on the first anniversary of the grant date. Restricted Stock awards are granted at a price equal to the fair market value of the date of the grant. 
 The Board has authorized non-employee directors, prior to the beginning of any calendar year, to elect to defer receipt of all or any part of the cash compensation a director might earn during such year under our Outside Directors Deferral Plan (Amended and Restated as of January 1, 2008). Amounts so deferred will be paid to the director upon his or her separation from service, death, or disability, adjusted for any investment gains (or losses) thereon. Alternatively, directors may elect to have deferred compensation credited to a rabbi trust established by us with an independent trustee, which administers the investment of amounts so credited for the

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
 We have adopted procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant involving an amount in excess of 120,000, and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. Under SEC rules, a related person is a director, nominee for director, executive officer, owner of more than 5 of our Common Stock or immediate family member of any of the above. On an annual basis, each director, nominee for director and officer and certain 5 or greater shareholders are required to complete a Director and Officer Questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transactions with us in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. Our general counsel is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of procedures and controls to obtain information from these related persons. The charter of our Audit Committee provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for review, approval, or ratification of related-person transactions. Though we have no written policy, it is the practice of our Audit Committee to approve such transactions only if it deems them to be in the best interests of the Company. When considering a transaction, the Audit Committee will review all relevant factors, including our rationale for entering into a related-person transaction, alternatives to the transaction, whether the transaction is on terms at least as fair to the Company as would be the case were the transaction entered into with a third party, and potential for an actual or apparent conflict of interest. The Audit Committee reports its findings to the Board.

 We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify such individuals, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with the Company. 
 BOARD LEADERSHIP AND COMMITTEE STRUCTURE 
 Our Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Executive Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each committee is composed of at least three independent directors, and each committee operates under a written charter, which are all available on our website www.lee.net by clicking on About and then Governance. 
 The members of the committees are shown in the table below: 
 Audit Committee (1) 
 ECC (1) 
 NCGC (1) 
 Steven C. Fletcher Member Member Chairman Margaret R. Liberman Member Mary E. Junck Brent M. Magid Chairman Member Shaun E. McAlmont Member Herbert W. Moloney lll Member Chairman Member Kevin D. Mowbray David T. Pearson Member Gregory P. Schermer Member Member 
 (1) The Committee is composed of independent non-employee directors. See discussion of Director Independence below. 
 As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board has no formal policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chairman and the CEO. Our Board presently believes that having a separate Chairman and CEO, together with an independent Lead Director, provides the best Board leadership structure for the Company. This structure, together with our other corporate governance practices, provides strong independent oversight of management, while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the Company. Ms. Junck serves as Chairman of the Board and Kevin Mowbray serves as President and CEO. Our Lead Director is a non-employee director who is elected by the independent members of the Board at its annual meeting. Herbert W. Moloney III, a director since 2001, currently serves as our Lead Director. 
 The role of Mr. Moloney, as Lead Director, includes the following duties: 
 Preside at all meetings of the Board when the Chairman is not present; 
 Call meetings of the non-management directors, as needed; 
 Develop the agendas for meetings of the non-management directors; 
 Preside at executive sessions of the non-management directors; 
 Confer regularly with the Chairman and the CEO; 
 Serve as a liaison between the CEO and the non-management directors; 
 In consultation with the Chairman, review and approve Board meeting schedules and agendas; and 
 Meet with shareholders as appropriate.

 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses the independence of each director and director nominee and makes recommendations to the Board. For a director or director nominee to be independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company other than his or her service as a director. In addition, members of the Audit Committee and Executive Compensation Committee must meet heightened independence standards under applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. 
 Our Board has examined the relationship between each of our non-employee directors and the Company and has determined that Ms. Junck and Ms. Liberman and Messrs. Fletcher, Magid, McAlmont, Moloney. Pearson and Schermer qualify as independent directors in accordance with NASDAQ rules and, in the case of the Audit Committee and Executive Compensation Committee, the rules of the SEC. Mr. Mowbray does not qualify as an independent director because he is an employee of the Company.

 On March 16, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of BH Media Group, Inc. and The Buffalo News, Inc. for a combined purchase price of (collectively, the "Transactions"). 
 Certain amounts in prior period Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Pursuant to our acquisition of BH Media and Buffalo News, we realigned the presentation of certain home delivery print revenue and certain other Subscription revenue from other revenue to subscription revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income (loss) and Comprehensive Income (loss). As a result of this updated presentation, subscription revenue increased and other revenue decreased by in 2021 and by in 2020. Operating revenues, net income (loss), accumulated deficit, and earnings per share remain unchanged. 
 
 In 2021 and 2020, we allocated revenue from our full access subscriptions between print and digital subscription revenues. In 2022, due to the increased prominence of digital-only revenues, we revised this presentation to classify full access subscriptions as print subscription revenue, and discretely present digital-only subscription revenues. 2021 and 2020 amounts were reclassified in Note 4 to conform to the current year presentation. Operating revenues, net income (loss), accumulated deficit, and earnings per share remain unchanged. 
 On February 25, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a one-for-ten split of the Company's common stock (the "Reverse Stock Split"). Effective March 15, 2021 the Company's shares began trading on a post reverse split basis. Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split in March 2021. The split did not change the Company's Common Stock Par value but changed opening Common Stock and Additional Paid in Capital balances by offsetting amounts. 
 During the year ended September 26, 2021 we identified an error related to pension contributions recorded incorrectly in the year ended September 27, 2020. The error was due to a directional issue whereby pension contributions were reported as operating cash inflows in the statement of cash flows instead of operating cash outflows. Recording this out of period adjustment had no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income (loss) and Comprehensive Income (loss) for the 52 weeks ended September 26, 2021 and had no impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The correction impacted the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Pension contributions were corrected to a cash outflow of and the change in pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations have been corrected to a decrease of . Net cash provided by operating activities did not change. We did not believe the impact of the adjustment was material to our consolidated financial statements for any previously issued financial statements taken as a whole.

 . BH Media includes daily newspapers and digital operations, in addition to paid weekly newspapers with websites and other print products. Buffalo News is a provider of local print and digital news to the Buffalo, NY area. The rationale for the acquisition was primarily the attractive nature of the various publications, businesses, and digital platforms as well as the revenue growth and operating expense synergy opportunities. 
 The Transactions were funded pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of January 29, 2020, between the Company and BH Finance LLC, a Nebraska limited liability company affiliated with Berkshire (the "Credit Agreement"), as described further in Note 7. 
 Between July 2, 2018 and March 16, 2020, the Company managed the BH Media Newspaper Business pursuant to the Management Agreement between BH Media and the Company dated June 26, 2018 ("Management Agreement"). In connection with the Transactions, the Management Agreement terminated on March 16, 2020. As part of the settlement of the preexisting relationship, the Company received at closing. This amount represents in fixed fees pro-rated under the contract and in variable fees based upon the pro-rated annual target. The amount we received settled our existing contract asset balance, which totaled as of December 29, 2019, and the remaining amount was reflected in Other Revenue for the 13 weeks ended March 29, 2020. The amount of variable fees was estimated based on BH Media financial performance through March 16, 2020. Actual financial performance through March 16, 2020 did not vary materially from the estimated amount. As such, the Company did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of the settlement of this preexisting relationship. 
 In connection with the Transactions, the Company entered into a lease agreement between BH Media, as Landlord, and the Company, as Tenant, providing for the leasing of properties and related fixtures (including production equipment) used in the BH Media Newspaper Business ("BH Lease").

 (1) Fully amortized balances were removed in 2022. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company wrote off approximately million of gross cost and accumulated amortization related to fully amortized customer and newspaper subscriber lists, as well as million of gross cost and accumulated amortization related to fully amortized non-compete and consulting agreements. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company wrote off the gross cost and accumulated amortization for additional fully amortized customer and newspaper subscriber lists, and wrote down the gross cost and accumulated amortization for customer and newspaper subscriber lists that were previously impaired, for an aggregate total of million. The adjustments did not have an impact on the net balances previously reported during any of the interim periods during 2022, nor any prior fiscal periods. 
 As discussed in Note 1, the Company reviews goodwill and non-amortized intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 350. 
 All of the Company s goodwill is attributed to the single reporting unit. For goodwill, the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value. For goodwill, the calculated fair value was determined using the income approach. Estimates of fair value include Level 3 inputs as they are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and are made at a specific point in time. Thus changes in key assumptions from period to period could significantly affect the estimates of fair value. The Company performed its annual assessment on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, and determined the fair value of our single reporting unit was in excess of carrying value and as such, there was no impairment in 2021 and 2022. In 2022, the Company disposed of a non-core operation with of attributable goodwill. 
 For mastheads, the calculated fair value includes Level 3 inputs that were determined using the royalty savings method. The key assumptions used in the fair value estimates under the royalty savings method are revenue and market growth, royalty rates for newspaper mastheads (the royalty rates utilized range from to ), estimated tax rates, and appropriate risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (for 2022, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average cost of capital used was , and , respectively). These assumptions reflect Lee's best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. A basis point decrease in royalty rates would result in an additional of impairment. Increasing the discount rate by basis points would result in an additional of impairment. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of non-amortized intangible assets. Such charges are recorded in assets loss (gain) on sales, impairments and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We recorded deferred income tax benefits related to these charges.

 Warrants 
 In connection with the 2 nd Lien Term Loan entered into in the 2014 Refinancing, we entered into a Warrant Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the "Warrant Agreement"). Under the Warrant Agreement, certain affiliates or designees of the 2 nd Lien Lenders received on March 31, 2014 their pro rata share of warrants to purchase, in cash, an initial aggregate of shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to anti-dilution provisions (the "Warrants"). The Warrants represent, when fully exercised, approximately of shares of Common Stock outstanding at March 30, 2014 on a fully diluted basis. The exercise price of the Warrants was per share. The Warrants expired in March 2022. 
 The Warrant Agreement contained provisions requiring the Warrants to be measured at fair value and included in warrants and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We re-measure the fair value of the liability each reporting period, with changes reported in other, net non-operating income (expense). The initial fair value of the Warrants was . See Note 15. 
 In connection with the issuance of the Warrants, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of March 14, 2014 (the "Registration Rights Agreement").

The depreciable lives of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. 
 During the period ended September 25, 2022, the Company permanently vacated office and distribution space related to leases. The space was vacated as some of our locations have transitioned to long-term remote working arrangements and space consolidation. The abandonment of lease space is an indicator of impairment and the Company assessed the lease ROU asses and leasehold improvements for impairment. Estimates of fair value include Level 3 inputs which are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and are made at a specific point in time.

 For the year ended September 25, 2022, the most significant driver of the decrease in benefit obligation was the higher actuarial gains experienced by all plans and the annuity purchase mentioned above. The plans recognized actuarial gains due to significant increases in bond yields that resulted in increases to the discount rates. Discount rate increases were partially offset by actual return on assets falling behind expected returns for the year. For the year ended September 26, 2021, the most significant driver of the decrease in benefit obligations for the plans was the higher actuarial gains experienced by all plans. The pension plans recognized actuarial gains due to small increases in bond yields that resulted in increases to the discount rates and actual return on assets exceeding expected returns for the year improving the funded status of the plans. 
 Plan Assets 
 The primary objective of our investment strategy is to satisfy our pension obligations at a reasonable cost. Assets are actively invested to balance real growth of capital through appreciation, reinvestment of dividend and interest income, and safety of invested funds. 
 Our investment policy outlines the governance structure for decision making, sets investment objectives and restrictions and establishes criteria for selecting and evaluating investment managers. The use of derivatives is prohibited, except on a case-by-case basis where the manager has a proven capability, and only to hedge quantifiable risks such as exposure to foreign currencies. An investment committee, consisting of certain of our executives and supported by independent consultants, is responsible for monitoring compliance with the investment policy. Assets are periodically redistributed to maintain the appropriate policy allocation.

 Plan assets include no Company securities. Assets include cash and cash equivalents and receivables from time to time due to the need to reallocate assets within policy guidelines. As of September 26, 2021, Buffalo News had a different policy for asset allocation than the Company's other plans. As of September 25, 2022, all Company plans asset allocation were the same. 
 Due to the timing of the annuity purchase (as discussed above), funds were organized in a way that provided sufficient liquidity for the transaction. This caused our pension plans asset allocation to differ significantly from our desired policy as of September 25, 2022.

As of September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had and of accrued withdrawal liabilities. The liabilities reflect the estimated net present value of payments to the fund, payable over years. 
 Several multiemployer plans have CBAs that expire in the next twelve months. It is reasonably possible that if the Company is unable to renegotiate these agreements employees could go on strike which could disrupt the normal operations of the Company. Of our employees in CBA's, approximately have CBA's that expire in the next 12 months.

 Approximately and of the gross unrecognized tax benefit balances for 2022 and 2021, respectively, relate to state net operating losses which are netted against deferred taxes on our balance sheet. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was at September 25, 2022. The company does not expect that unrecognized tax benefits will fluctuate significantly in the next twelve months. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The amount of accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits was, net of tax, at September 25, 2022 and at September 26, 2021. There were no amounts provided for penalties at September 25, 2022 or September 26, 2021. 
 At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had a deferred tax asset of and , respectively, related to disallowed interest expense. 
 The company is current undergoing a New York Franchise Tax audit that includes fiscal year periods 2019 through 2021.

The Federal and remaining state returns are open beginning with the September 24, 2017 year. 
 At September 25, 2022, we have state tax benefits of approximately in net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards that expire between 2022 and 2040. These NOL carryforwards result in a deferred income tax asset of at September 25, 2022, a portion of which is offset by a valuation allowance.

 Income Taxes 
 Commitments exclude unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for such matters. See Note 14. 
 We file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and various state tax jurisdictions. From time to time, we are subject to routine audits by those agencies, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies, believe our positions taken regarding our filings are valid, and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters. However, the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material, either positively or negatively, to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined. We do not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows. 
 We have various income tax examinations ongoing and at various stages of completion, but generally our income tax returns have been audited or closed to audit through 2014. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters. While we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is our opinion that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole.

 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (the Company as of September 25, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 25, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2022 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Valuation of indefinite-lived mastheads 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s non-amortized intangible assets in mastheads are 26.3 million as of September 25, 2022. The Company reviews the indefinite-lived mastheads for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value 
 94 

Table of Contents 

 of each masthead with its carrying amount. The Company determines fair value using the relief from royalty method, which utilizes a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of each masthead. The significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of indefinite-lived mastheads are the discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) and royalty rates. During the year ended September 25, 2022, the Company recognized impairments of 13.5 million on these indefinite-lived mastheads. 
 
 We identified the determination of the fair values of the indefinite-lived mastheads as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions the Company makes to calculate their fair value, specifically the discount rate and royalty rates. Auditing the significant assumptions involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment due to their significant estimation uncertainty, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter: 
 
 Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation, who assisted in: 
 
 Evaluating the discount rate by developing an independent estimate using independently obtained market data of guideline public companies and compared to the rate used by the Company; and 
 
 Evaluating the royalty rates by (i) evaluating management s profit-split analysis and (ii) comparing them to a range based on publicly available royalty rates. 
 
 Valuation of defined benefit pension plan assets and postretirement plan assets that do not have a readily determinable fair value 
 
 As described in Notes 1, 9, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has certain defined benefit pension plan assets and postretirement plan assets for which there is not a readily determinable fair value, and the Company applies a practical expedient to exclude such assets from the fair value hierarchy. As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of defined benefit pension plan assets was 209.4 million at September 25, 2022, which included 34.8 million of assets excluded from the fair value hierarchy. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of postretirement plan assets was 23.9 million at September 25, 2022, which included 3.6 million of assets excluded from the fair value hierarchy. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, these plan assets include certain investments in equity funds and diversified funds valued at the net asset value of units held at the end of the period based upon the value of the underlying investments, which is determined using multiple approaches including quoted market prices and private market quotations. 
 
 We identified the valuation of plan assets that have no readily determinable fair value as a critical audit matter. The valuation of these plan assets was complex due to the higher estimation uncertainty of the inputs in the determinations of the net asset value of units held at the end of the reporting period. Auditing these elements involved subjective auditor judgment because certain information regarding the valuation of these investments is based on unaudited information available to management at the time of the valuation, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter: 
 
 Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in valuation, who assisted in: 
 
 Obtaining the latest audited financial statements for certain investments, performing a roll forward of the investment balance to compute an estimated market return on investment, and comparing the market return to relevant benchmarks of various public funds. 
 
 Yield curve utilized in determining the discount rates used in measurement of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s defined benefit pension obligations were 208.8 million, compared to the fair value of defined benefit pension plan assets of 209.4 
 95 

Table of Contents 

 million at September 25, 2022. As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s postretirement benefit obligations were 12.3 million, compared to the fair value of postretirement plan assets of 23.9 million at September 25, 2022. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations, including discount rates, at the month-end closest to the fiscal year-end. The Company determines the discount rates used to measure the obligations based on investment yields available at year-end on corporate bonds rated AA and above with a maturity to match the expected benefit payment stream. 
 
 We identified the yield curve utilized in the determination of the discount rate assumptions, which are utilized in the measurement of certain of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as a critical audit matter. The discount rates have a significant effect on the measurement of certain of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Auditing the yield curve utilized in the determination of the discount rates was complex because it involved especially subjective auditor judgment, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter: 
 
 Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge in actuarial valuation, who assisted in: 
 
 Evaluating the reasonableness of the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rates applied in measuring certain of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, which included comparing the discount rates based on the yield curve used by the Company to independent estimates of discount rates based on a separate publicly available yield curve.
